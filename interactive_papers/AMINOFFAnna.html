He dispatched 325 aircraft to attack by night at low level – between 6,000 and 9,000 feet. Torrents of incendiaries fell and exploded with their characteristic sharp crackle. Only twelve bombers were lost, most destroyed by updrafts from the blazing city. Forty-two suffered flak damage, but Japanese defences were feeble. A pilot wrote laconically next day: ‘We took off the last night at 1835 and after a dull trip hit the coast of Japan at 0210. Even before we made landfall we could see the fires at Tokyo. We were at 7,800 and there was smoke towering above us. The radar run was perfect and we dropped in an open spot visually. The city was a ‘Dante’s inferno.’ One night fighter made a run on us but we turned into him and lost him.’” (616, from http://b-29.org/) <br><br>“Gen. Lauris Norstad said apologetically to LeMay’s sacked predecessor, Gen. Haywood Hansell, ’LeMay is an operator, the rest of us are planners. That’s all there is to it.’” (617, from Steve Birdsall, <i>Saga of the Superfortress</i>, Sidgwick & Jackson [1981], 143)<br><br>'); break;

<p>STUDS TERKEL'S <b>"The Good War”</b> is a major work of
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">oral history</a>, offering us a compelling picture of World
War II through the voices of men and women who experienced
it at firsthand. Here, the account of the poet
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">John Ciardi</a>, who served as an air force gunner in the
Pacific.</p>


<p><i>The Bombers and the Bombed</i></p>

<p>I had no attraction to the military, yet we had to go out and do
something. I was terribly innocent at twenty-six. I was the tanglefoot
civilian who did not know what he was doing. I did not want to go in the
navy. I would not under any circumstances get into a submarine. I didn't
see any point in being a footslogger, sleeping in the mud.</p>
<p>I had dreams of being a pilot, so I signed up as an aviation <a href="#" class="footnote" id=”footnote-5">cadet</a>.
The army decided I was not pilot material. The army was right. They
sent me to navigation school. I would have come out as a navigator and
been sent to the Eighth Air Force. As a graduate student, l had signed
some petitions in favor of the Spanish Loyalists. When I came up for
graduation from the navigation school, I was classified as a PAF–a
premature anti-fascist. The Dies Committee had wired in. I did not get
a commission. A year later, I heard that all forty-four men of my graduating
class were either KIA or MIA, dead or missing in action.</p>
<p>When we got to Saipan, I was a gunner on a <a href="#" class="footnote" id=”footnote-4">B-29</a>. It seemed certain
to me we were not going to survive. We had to fly thirty-five missions.
The average life of a crew was something between six and eight missions.
So you simply took the extra pay, took the badges, took relief from dirty
details. Now pay up.</p>
<p>There was a way out. Any man who was tired of flying could report
to the squadron CO and ground himself. He would be put on permanent
garbage detail. Permanent garbage detail is better than burning to death.
Yet in all the time we were there, most of a year, only two men in the
whole squadron put themselves on permanent garbage detail. Not a one
received any wisecracks from anybody. Everybody knew that if he dared,
he'd be on that garbage truck with ’em.</p>
<p>I don't think it was patriotism. I think it was a certain amount of
pride. The unit was the crew. You belonged to eleven men. You’re trained together, you're bound together. I was once ordered to fly in the
place of a gunner who had received a shrapnel wound. I dreaded that
mission. I wanted to fly with my own crew. I didn't know those other
people. I didn't want to run the risk of dying with strangers.</p>
<p>I was saved by two more flukes. The first was the Dies Committee.</p>
<p>We got to Saipan in November of '44, in time to fly the first raids
over Tokyo. Those were long missions. We were in the air normally
about fourteen hours. Most of it was over the open Pacific. We had to
get over the coast, make our bombing run, and then make it back to
Saipan. We took some rather heavy losses. Sixty-five percent of them, as
I recall, were due to engine failures. The B-29 tended to catch fire. They
finally flew the bugs out of this new plane.</p>
<p>At one time, one of the blisters on our plane was damaged–the
plexiglass bubble out of which the gunner tracked. There were no spares
on the island. We sat it out almost all the month of February of '45,
waiting for a replacement. During that time, we lost a lot of crews. We
were out surfing, playing in the ocean, spear fishing. I would give myself
at least a forty percent chance of having been killed in February, except
for this blister thing. Instead, it turned into a vacation.</p>
<p>The third time was a pure fluke. I was halfway through the tour of
missions. I know it was over fourteen. You got an air medal for surviving
five missions. If you survived eight more, you got another air medal. The
next one was a DFC. I got two air medals, so I must have had fourteen
or fifteen missions. I received orders to report to headquarters. The
colonel in charge of awards and decorations said, "We've run into real
trouble with our program. We need somebody with combat-crew experience
who can write. You've taught college English, you've published a
book. You're now working for me. You're going to take charge of the
awards and decorations."
<p>This program was raided by the brass, so that decorations were
pointless after a while. Anybody up to the grade of a captain, you may
assume earned it. Anybody from the grade of major up who has a high
decoration <i>may</i> have earned it, but you don't have to believe it.</p>
<p>"Co to your squadron," the colonel said, "pick up your gear. We’ll
keep you on flying pay. You'll have to fly back and forth to Guam to
report to the board. While you're at it, sew on an extra stripe." I was then
a staff sergeant. I couldn't make tech for having been shot at, but I did it
for grinding out words.</p>
<p>A few missions later, the crew I had been on took a direct hit over
Tokyo Bay from an unexploded flake shell. It went right through the
wing gas tank and the plane just blew up, disintegrated in midair. Just
one of those flukes.</p>
<p>That's three times I should have been absolutely dead, except for
flukes.</p>
<p>I fed sorry for the kids of Vietnam. They couldn't have figured out
what it was they were fighting for. I knew why I was there. That doesn't
mean I wasn't scared. I don't know what I would have done in Vietnam.
I mean, I'm a botch as a killer, as a soldier. But as an American, I felt
very strongly I did not want to be alive to see the Japanese impose
surrender terms.</p>
<p>On the night before a mission, you reviewed the facts. You tried to
get some sleep. The army is very good at keeping you awake forever
before you have a long mission. Sleep wouldn't come to you. You get to
thinking by this time tomorrow you may have burned to death. I used to
have little routines for kidding myself: Forget it, you died last week.
You'd get some Dutch courage out of that.</p>
<p>We were in the terrible business of burning out Japanese towns.
That meant women and old people, children. One part of me–a surviving
savage voice–says, I'm sorry we left any of them living. I wish we'd
finished killing them all. Of course, as soon as rationality overcomes the
first impulse, you say, Now, come on, this is the human race, let's try to
be civilized.</p>
<p>I had to condition myself to be a killer. This was remote control. All
we did was push buttons. I didn't see anybody we killed. I saw the fires
we set. The first four and a half months was wasted effort. We lost all
those crews for nothing. We had been trained to do precision high-altitude
bombing from thirty-two thousand feet. It was all beautifully
planned, except we discovered the Siberian jet stream. The winds went
off all computed bomb tables. We began to get winds at two hundred
knots, and the bombs simply scattered all over Japan. We were hitting
nothing and losing planes.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">Curtis LeMay</a> came in and changed the whole operation. He had
been head of the Eighth Air Force and was sent over to take on the
Twentieth. That's the one I was in. He changed tactics. He said, Go in
at night from five thousand feet, without gunners, just a couple of rear-end
observers. We’ll save weight on the turrets and on ammunition. The
Japanese have no fighter resistance at night. They have no radar. We’ll
drop fire sticks.</p>
<p>I have some of my strike photos at home. Tokyo looked like one
leveled bed of ash. The only things standing were some stone buildings.
If you looked at the photos carefully, you'd see that they were gutted.
Some of the people jumped into rivers to get away from these fire storms.
They were packed in so tight to get away from the fire, they suffocated.
They were so close to one another, they couldn't fall over. It must have
been horrible.</p>
<p>I have one image of an early raid in which a Japanese fighter plane
bored in. I saw his goggled face as he went over the top of our plane. I
got a burst into him and he was gone. I got a probable for it. After the first raid, nothing came at us from behind. The Japanese lined up across
the sky and came in to ram. They would all swarm on the B-29 and finish
it off. That happened from time to time.</p>
<p>We were playing a lottery. A certain number of planes had to be
lost. You were just hoping that by blind chance yours would not be.
When news of that atom bomb came–we didn't know what it was–we
won the lottery. Hey, we're gonna get out of here! We may survive this
after all.</p>
<p>I never had any ambition to be a warrior. l had to condition myself,
to sell myself against my own death. One measure of that is hatred. I did
want every Japanese dead. Part of it was our own propaganda machine,
but part of it was what we heard accurately. This was the enemy. We
were there to eliminate them. That's the soldier's short-term bloody view.</p>
<p>I was never really a soldier. I was caught up in the army, a civilian
putting in my service. When it was over, I had a longer view. It's anyone's
universe. Anyone has as good a right to it as I have. Who am I to want
to go out killing people?</p>
<p>I think the Germans of that era were guilty. On the other hand, I
think any people subjected to a propaganda barrage, with their patriotic
feelings worked on, could become savage.</p>
<p>When you're on a mission and you saw a Japanese plane go down,
you cheered. This was a football game. When one of your guys went
down, you sighed. It was miserable. One of the saddest things I ever saw,
when we were flying wing on a plane that got hit, was the barber's-chair
gunner in the big bubble at the very top. He was right there beside us in
plain sight, beginning to go down. He just waved his hand goodbye.
There was nothing you could do. You couldn't reach out to touch him.
Of course, that got you.</p>
<p>You were under a compulsion to say nice things about the guy. You
saw a plane break up. You saw it catch fire. You saw two chutes, one of
them burning. Whatever it was, the truth is–the dark truth–you were
secretly glad. It could have been you. It was a superstitious ritual we
were playing. There were a certain number of blackballs to be passed
out. Every time another plane went down, it was taken out of play.
Somebody had to catch it, and somebody else caught it for you. It didn't
make any sense, but that's the way we felt. That's a dirty, dark thing to
say. When we go to funerals of old friends these days, in one corner of
our minds we're saying, Well, I outlived that old bastard.</p>
<p>When the news came that so-and-so's crew had been hit and gone
down over Tokyo, you made sounds: Oh, my God. But somewhere, very
deep down in your psyche, is, It could have been me.</p>
<p>My first poems of any consequence, I feel, were war poems. I'm not
a war poet, but just about that time they were beginning to come together.
I found myself writing a lot of elegies for friends of mine who did
not make it. Then it occurred to me that the way things were going, I
might not make at. So l decided to write my own: "Elegy Just in Case . . .</p>
<i>He recites:</i>
<blockquote><p>Here lie Ciardi's pearly bones
In their ripe organic mess.
Jungle brown, his chromosomes
Breed to a new address.</p>
<p>Here lies the sgt.'s mortal wreck
Lily spiked and termite kissed,
Spider pendant from his neck
And a beetle on his wrist.</p>
<p>Bring the tick and southern flies
Where the land crabs run unmourning
Through a night of jungle skies
To a climeless morning.</p>
<p>And bring the chalked eraser here
Fresh from rubbing out his name.
Burn the crew-board for a bier.
(Also Colonel what’s-his-name.)</p>
<p>Let no dice be stored and still.
Let no poker deck be torn.
But pour the smuggled rye until
The barracks threshold is outworn.</p>
<p>File the papers, pack the clothes,
Send the coded word through air–
”We regret and no one knows
Where the sgt. goes from here.”</p></blockquote>
