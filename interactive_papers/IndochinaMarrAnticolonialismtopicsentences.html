		<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">COMPLETE CHRONOLOGY</a>
		<p>
	

(1) The Nguyen rulers and their representatives attempted to meet the barbarian
threat in the only ways they knew&#8212;namely, by exclusion of
Westerners, repression of Catholicism, antiquated military defense from
within citadels and breastworks, and, when all this failed, negotiation
from positions of abysmal weakness, perhaps hoping to stall or perhaps
unconsciously envisioning a simple “shifting of tribute” from Peking to
Paris. In the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1860s and 1870s</a>, however, as the tragedy worked itself out,
a few mandarins began to leave office in disgust, while literati who did not
hold office began to find more and more reason simply to stay in their
home villages and avoid involvement. As in the south, these people remained
loyal to the monarchy as an idealized institution but became increasingly
hostile toward those who were conducting state policy.
</p><p>
(2) When events came marching to their doors, however, all were forced to take stands.<br><br>
(3) In the long run, it would be the minority of the elite that would put the heaviest imprint on modern Vietnamese history, in this case those obdurate, militant, idealistic scholar-gentry who “knew the proper way of dying” for a person of their status in society.<br><br>
(4) I have made passing reference already to the breakdown well before 1882 of official authority in the north.<br><br>
(5) With the return of French forces to the Red River delta in 1882 and the second fall of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a>, northerners were just about through with any hopes of concrete royal leadership.<br><br>
(6) The poor showing of remaining royal units during the French attack on <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">Son Tay</a> December 14, 1883, put a final cap on northern alienation from Hue (see Map 2).<br><br>
(7) During 1884 there were numerous local attacks on French units, in direct violation of orders from Hue.<br><br>
(8) With the withdrawal of Ch’ing troops being essentially complete by the end of May 1885, the French could turn full attention to emasculating the lingering war party in Hue and to crushing all centers of local resistance.<br><br>
(9) There should be no hesitation in marking July 5, 1885, the date of Ham Nghi’s flight from the capital, as a turning point in the history of Vietnam’s response to foreign intervention.<br><br>
(10) Next, this date marked the termination of all remaining vestiges of Hue’s sovereignty and the imposition of the final structural elements of French colonial rule on Vietnam&#8212;without a native monarch to sanction these acts.<br><br>
(11) On strictly legalistic grounds, particularly among those who put survival of the dynasty ahead of all else, such a position was not illogical.<br><br>
(12) Finally, and perhaps most important, the significant numbers of scholar- gentry and peasants who had been pursuing local resistance efforts in previous years without traditional royal sanction must have been tremendously relieved and elated to find the king and some of his highest mandarins moving out among them, depending on them, and calling in the most emotive terms for a final struggle to throw out the foreign barbarians.<br><br>
(13) For more than a year before the flight from Hue, Ton That Thuyet had been storing weapons, rice, gold, and copper cash in several mountain strongholds, particularly one named Tan-So which was situated above Cam-Lo in Quang Tri province.<br><br>
(14) The major accomplishment up to that point lay in the promulgation and distribution to all corners of Vietnam of the Can Vuong (Loyalty to the King) Edict, which gave the resistance movement its name and which deserves translation in its entirety here: <br><br>
(15) It should be evident, even in translation, that this was a resistance edict in the classical tradition, appealing above all to the scholar-gentry, but not without emotional impact if read or interpreted to the people in general.<br><br>
(16) Without the prospect of reinforcements from France in the immediate future, General de Courcy was disturbed enough by the popular response to their edict to propose to the Minister of Foreign Affairs a partial or even general troop withdrawal from the north in order to concentrate on quieting the center.<br><br>
(17) While such activities in Hue were becoming a matter of mere derisive interest to more and more Vietnamese, there is considerable evidence that emotional, idealistic monarchism was about to enjoy a last burst of glory which centered on Ham Nghi until his capture in 1888, and then somehow continued without a monarch for six or seven years more.<br><br>
(18) To the degree that the Can Vuong was a disembodied monarchism, it was not within the mainstream of Vietnamese tradition, which empowered the physical king with both temporal and spiritual functions.<br><br>
(19) Lest we ourselves engage in idealization of this traditionalist phenomenon, it was important to remember that the scholar-gentry of the nineteenth century were closely rooted to the soil, specifically the soil of their home villages and districts.<br><br>
(20) Thus the scholar-gentry could and did communicate regularly and easily with the mass of the populace, an advantage that subsequent more urban elites shared less and less over the decades.<br><br>
(21) The only way that the Can Vuong movement can be rendered coherent in detail is to describe it along essentially regional lines.<br><br>
(22) The first area worth describing centers on the province of Quang-Binh, with overlap into Nghe An and Ha Tinh to the north and including the nearby mountains of Laos (see Map 3).<br><br>
(23) There was a weakness to this particular region, nevertheless, which the French would quickly learn to exploit.<br><br>
(24) In the meantime, however, uprisings in north Vietnam induced the French to shift some of their units up there again.<br><br>
(25) Ham Nghi had the additional problem in his upper mountain retreat of being heavily dependent on villagers of the Muong tribal minority, a people who had not been treated kindly under the _rule of his royal predecessors.<br><br>
(26) The next resistance area to the north included most of Ha Tinh, Nghe An, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, all cordoned off from points south by concentrations of French troops, although liaison was maintained by the mountain footpaths.<br><br>
(27) A man of different status led early Can Vuong efforts in Nghe An province.<br><br>
(28) In the first three years in central Vietnam by far the most important Can Vuong effort centered in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> province, particularly around the village bastion of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a>, adjacent to the road connecting the central and northern parts of the country (see Map 2) .<br><br>
(29) The commander-in-chief, an 1884 cu-nhan<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> graduate and doc-hoc named Pham Banh, was wise enough to know his military limitations: he delegated all tactical authority to Dinh Cong Trang, a nonmandarin from outside <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, with considerable guerilla experience and a small, tough band of his own.<br><br>
(30) Their next full-scale assault, on January 6, proved to be even more disastrous for the French.<br><br>
(31) By this time both sides were suffering the ill effects of the scores&#8212;perhaps hundreds&#8212;of unburied bodies strewn around the defense works.<br><br>
(32) Whereas resistance in central Vietnam from Quang-Binh northward was widespread and occasionally systematic, the action from Quang-Tri all the way south to Binh-Thuan appears to have been episodic, allowing the French to delegate most pacification duties to their mandarin collaborators.<br><br>
(33) The strongest sustained effort south of Quang Binh may have been in Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh, but even there the defection of a prime scholar-gentry leader and some of his following exposed the other scholar- gentry to rapid extermination.<br><br>
(34) When looked at from the French side, the decade after 1887 in central Vietnam was one of gradual but definite progress in the consolidation and rationalization of colonial rule.<br><br>
(35) <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, after the collapse of the resistance centered around BaDinh, was seemingly quiescent until early 1889.<br><br>
(36) On both sides of this new <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> conflict, however, the numbers of participants never seem to have approached those in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> effort.<br><br>
(37) In Nghe An and Ha Tinh the French crushing of the initial risings and capture of Ham Nghi in 1888 had deeply stunned the scholar-gentry.<br><br>
(38) Phan Dinh Phung was born in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1847</a> in Dong-Thai village, La-Son district, Ha Tinh province.<br><br>
(39) For all his scholastic success, Phan would never be known for his literary ability.<br><br>
(40) Despite his prominence in the last years of Tu Due’s reign, it is not clear from the evidence just where Phan Dinh Phung stood on the overriding court questions of “attack, defense, or negotiation” with the French.<br><br>
(41) In the first period of Can Vuong activity after July 1885 Phan used his home village as nerve center, setting up a small weapons factory and using local scholar-gentry as troop commanders.<br><br>
(42) This incident helps illustrate why Phan Dinh Phung became important to later generations of anticolonial leaders for his apparent identification with a countrywide cause, far removed from questions of family and region.<br><br>
(43) In 1887, considering his efforts up to that time to be ill-conceived, Phan ordered Cao Thang and other subordinates to cease open conflict and concentrate on building a solid network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents, and peasant supply contacts.<br><br>
(44) Phan Dinh Phung and Cao Thang had in fact picked the only area in central Vietnam where prolonged resistance was feasible after 1888.<br><br>
(45) Small remnants of risings in other locations did gravitate to the leadership of Phan Dinh Phung and Cao Thang.<br><br>
(46) Upon Phan Dinh Phung’s return from the north in 1889, the first order of business was to track down the Muong betrayer of King Ham Nghi and behead him.<br><br>
(47) At this point Cao Thang, either wearying of guerrilla conflict or sensing the ultimate decline of their movement, proposed to Phan Dinh Phung in open council a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of Nghe An and the surrounding posts.<br><br>
(48) Phan Dinh Phung quickly perceived the significance of this loss, as is revealed in his eulogy and funeral oration for Cao Thang.<br><br>
(49) French administrators may not have perceived Phan’s intent.<br><br>
(50) One of those relatives was selected to carry a long message from Hoang -cao Khai to Phan Dinh Phung.<br><br>
(51) To Hoang’s statements about popular grief and suffering, Phan retorted that responsibility for this must rest with the French, who “acted like a storm," forced the king to flee, and cast the country into disorder.<br><br>
(52) Hoang Cao Khai translated both letters into French and presented them to De Lanessan with the recommendation that it was time for final “destruction of this scholar-gentry rebellion.<br><br>
(53) Can Vuong efforts in north Vietnam, while different in approach from those of the center, were nonetheless just as important in sustaining the resistance ethic and in setting specific precedents for future generations.<br><br>
(54) In general, Can Vuong command relations in the north were even less structured than were those in central Vietnam, because newly energized royalist scholar-gentry had to place themselves in a more intimate and even dependent relationship with those forces, antidynastic and otherwise, which had been active well before 1885.<br><br>
(55) The man selected by Ham Nghi and his advisors to coordinate all resistance in north Vietnam was a tien-si from Nam-Dinh province named Nguyen Quang Bich.<br><br>
(56) In fact, China’s empress dowager, Tz’u-hsi, had decided to abandon all semblances of traditional tributary relations with Vietnam.<br><br>
(57) Nguyen Quang Bich never tried seriously to organize a central command for north Vietnam, and it is doubtful that he could have.<br><br>
(58) Between 1885 and 1889 the French were vaguely aware that pacification of the Tonkin lowlands depended ultimately on controlling the surrounding hills and mountains.<br><br>
(59) Thus, in 1890 most of north Vietnam’s midlands and highlands were essentially autonomous, containing a fantastic conglomeration of ethnic Vietnamese, remnant Chinese, Nung, Thai, Muong, Meo, and other tribal groups&#8212;none owing firm allegiance to anyone above the district or provincial level.<br><br>
(60) Such armed bands have come down in French history books as <i>pirates</i> and <i>rebelles</i>, while more recent Vietnamese historians generally have hailed them as patriots and righteous armies (nghia-quan).<br><br>
(61) Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is to outline the career of one of the most colorful and certainly the longest surviving of these mountain leaders: Hoang Hoa Tham, better known as De Tham, the “tiger of YenThe.<br><br>
(62) Yen-The saw its first really serious enemy•penetration between November 1890 and January 1891, with French forces building up to a total of thirteen hundred troops and forcing resistance units to retreat farther into the mountains.<br><br>
(63) A great amount of plotting and counterplotting ensued among the Vietnamese, those leaders who had gone over to the French trying to assassinate the holdouts and vice versa.<br><br>
(64) For all that, however, by late 1895 the civilian administrators were again dissatisfied with arrangements, particularly in view of De Tham’s attempts to infiltrate native colonial units and to extend his alliances to other localities.<br><br>
(65) There were other areas of resistance besides Yen-The after .<br><br>
(66) Unti1 1894, much to the anger of the French, it was still relatively easy to cross and recross the Sino/Vietnamese frontier.<br><br>
(67) Taken collectively, what was significant about the Can Vuong?<br><br>

(68) Yet they did fight on to eventual death or capture. In the material sense their struggle was rather foolish. And certainly very few Frenchmen ever quite understood what it was all about, to their ultimate misfortune. The Can Vuong movement provided crucial moral and spiritual continuity to the long struggle against this new foreign invader. Many of the more sensitive Can Vuong leaders, acutely aware that they almost surely would die violent deaths long before their country was liberated, paid self-conscious attention to their personal images as patriots in the eyes of the people—including the yet unborn. The patriotic poems, anecdotes, and narratives that spread during their resistance and after their deaths were in many ways historical reality in themselves, quite apart from their objective truth or falsity. The impact of poetry in particular was more real than anything conveyed by this page. And as we shall see, the next generation came to maturity amidst this turmoil. Whether later they were sympathetic to or skeptical of Can Vuong efforts, the positions they argued and the actions they took were in large part conditioned by the tactical failures and the spiritual successes of their predecessors.<br><br>
