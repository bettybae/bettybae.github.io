<center>The Silence of the Sea<br><br>
I</center><br><br>

To the memory of SAINT-POL-ROUX the murdered poet<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a><br><br>

There was a great display of military preparations before he
arrived. First came two troopers, both very fair; one thin and
gangling, the other squarely built with the hands of a quarryman.
They looked at my house without going in. Later an N.C.0.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
arrived, and the gangling trooper went with him. They spoke to
me in what they thought was French, but I didn’t understand a
word. However, I showed them the unoccupied rooms and they
seemed satisfied.<br>
<br>
Next morning an enormous grey army touring-car drove into
my garden. The driver and a slim, fair-haired, smiling young
soldier extricated two packing-cases from it, plus a large bundle
wrapped up in grey cloth. They took the whole lot up to the largest
room. The car went away, and a few hours later I heard hoof-beats.
Three horsemen appeared. One dismounted and went off to have a
look at the old stone building. When he came back all, men and
horses alike, went into the barn which I use as my workroom. I
saw later that they had driven the clamp from my carpenter’s bench
between two stones, in a hole in the wall, fastened a rope to the
clamp and tied the horses to the rope.<br>
<br>
For two days nothing more happened. I never saw a soul. The
troopers went out early with their horses; in the evening they
brought them back, and then they went to bed in the straw with
which they had stuffed the attic.<br>
<br>
Then, on the morning of the third day, the big touring-car
returned. The smiling young man heaved a large officer’s suitcase
on his shoulder and carried it up to the room. Then he took his
kit bag which he put in the room next door. He came downstairs
<b>(p.71)</b> and, speaking in good French to my niece, asked her for some
sheets. <br>
<br>
It was my niece who went to open the door when there was a
knock. She had just brought me my coffee, as she did every
evening (coffee helps me to sleep), and I was sitting in the back of
the room in comparative darkness. The door opens straight on to
the garden, and all round the house runs a red-tiled path which is
very useful when it is wet. We heard footsteps and the sound of
heels on the tiles. My niece looked at me and put down her cup. I
kept mine in my hands. <br>
<br>
It was night, but not very cold; all that November it was never
very cold. I could see a massive figure, a flat cap, a mackintosh
thrown round the shoulders like a cape. <br>
<br>
My niece had opened the door and was waiting in silence. She
had pulled the door right back to the wall and was standing up
against the wall not looking at anything. For my part, I was
drinking my coffee in little sips. <br>
<br>
“If you please,” said the officer in the doorway. He gave a little
nod of greeting and seemed to be gauging the depth of the silence.
Then he came in. <br>
<br>
He slid the cape onto his arm, gave a military salute, and took off
his cap; then he turned to my niece and, with a quiet smile, made
her a very slight bow. Then he faced me and made me a deeper
bow. “My name,” he said, “is Werner von Ebrennac.” I had time
for the thought to cross my mind quickly: That’s not a German
name; perhaps he is descended from a Protestant emigre.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> Then he
added, “I am extremely sorry.” <br>
<br>
The last word, which he drawled slightly, fell into the silence.
My niece had closed the door and was still leaning against the wall
looking straight in front of her. I hadn’t got up. Slowly I put down
my empty cup on the harmonium, then crossed my hands and
waited. <br>
<br>
The officer went on. “It had to be done, of course. I would have
avoided it if I could. I am sure my orderly will do his best not to
<b>(p.72)</b> disturb you.” He was standing in the middle of the room, huge and
very thin; he could easily touch the beams by raising his arm. His
head was hanging forward a little as if hi” neck didn’t grow out
from his shoulders, but from the top of his chest. He wasn’t round-shouldered,
but it looked as if he were. His narrow shoulders
and hips were most striking, and his face was handsome; it was
very masculine, and there were two big hollows in his cheeks. I
couldn’t see his eyes, which were hidden in the shadow of his
brow, but they seemed light-coloured; his hair was fair and
smooth, brushed straight back and giving out a silky glitter under
the chandelier. <br>
<br>
The silence was unbroken, it grew closer and closer like the
moming mist; it was thick and motionless. The immobility of my
niece, and for that matter my own, made it even heavier, turned it
to lead. The officer himself, taken aback, stood without moving till
at last I saw the beginning of a smile on his lips. His smile was
serious and without a trace of irony. With his hand he made a vague
gesture whose meaning I did not grasp, and fixed his eyes on my
niece, still standing there stiffly, so that I had leisure to examine his
strong profile, his thin and prominent nose. I saw a gold tooth
shining between his half-closed lips. He turned his eyes away at
last, stared at the fire on the hearth, and said, “I feel a very deep
respect for people who love their country.” Then he raised his head
abruptly and looked at the carved angel over the window. “I could
go up to my room now,” he said, “but I don’t know the way.” My
niece opened the door which gives on to the back staircase and
began to climb the steps, without looking at the officer, just as if
she had been alone. The officer followed her, and it was then I
noticed that he was lame in one leg. I heard them cross the
anteroom; the German’s steps, a strong one, then a weak one,
echoed down the corridor. A door opened and closed again; then
my niece came back. She picked up her cup and went on drinking
her coffee. I lit my pipe, and for a few minutes neither of us spoke;
then I said, “Thank the Lord he looks fairly decent.” My niece
shrugged her shoulders. She took my velvet jacket on her lap and
finished the piece of invisible mending which she had begun.
Next morning the officer came down while we were having
breakfast in the kitchen. Another staircase leads to it, and I don’t
know if the German heard us or if he came that way by accident. <br>
<br>
<b>(p.73)</b> He stopped in the doorway and said, “I have had a very good
night. I should hope yours was as good as mine.” He looked round
the huge room with a smile. As we had very little wood and less
coal, I had repainted it, we had brought in some furniture, some
copper pans and old plates, so as to shut ourselves in there for the
winter. All that, he took in, and we caught the gleam of the edge of
his very white teeth. I saw that his eyes were not blue, as I had
thought, but a golden brown. At last he crossed the room and
opened the door on to the garden. He took a couple of steps and
turned back to inspect our long low house with its ancient brown
tiles and its covering of creepers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> His smile broadened. “Your old
mayor had told me I was to stay at the Chateau,” he said, pointing
with a backward flick of his hand at the pretentious building which
could be seen a little higher up the hill, through the bare trees. “I
shall congratulate my men on their mistake. Here it is a much more
beautiful chateau.” Then he closed the door, saluted us through the
window pane, and disappeared. <br>
<br>
That evening he came back at the same time as before. We were
having our coffee. He knocked but didn’t wait for my niece to open
the door; he opened it himself. “I am afraid I am disturbing you,”
he said. “If you would rather, I will come in through the kitchen;
then you can keep this door locked.” He crossed the room and
stopped a moment with his hand on the doorknob, looking into the
various corners of the smoking-room. Then he made a slight bow.
“I wish you a very good night,” he said, and went out. <br>
<br>
We never locked the door. I am not sure that our motives for this
omission were very clear or unmixed. By a silent agreement, my
niece and I had decided to make no changes in our life, not even in
the smallest detail- as if the officer didn’t exist, as if he had been a
ghost. But it’s possible that there was another sentiment mixed
with this wish in my heart: I can’t hurt anyone’s feelings, even my
enemy’s, without suffering myself.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> <br>
<br>
For a long time, for more than a month in fact, the same scene
took place every day. The officer knocked and came in. He spoke a
few words about the weather, the temperature, or some other
subject equally unimportant: all that these remarks had in common
was that they did not call for an answer. He always lingered a
moment on the threshold of the little door, and looked around him. <br>
<br>
<b>(p.74)</b> A ghost of a smile would betray the pleasure which he seemed to
get from this examination - the same examination every day, and
the same pleasure. His eyes would rest on the bowed profile of my
niece, invariably severe and impassive, and when at last he took his
eyes off her I was sure I could read in them a kind of smiling
approval. Then he would say with a bow as he left, “I wish you a
very good night.” <br>
<br>
One evening everything changed abruptly. Outside, a fine snow
mixed with rain was falling, terribly cold and damping. On the
hearth I was burning the heavy logs which I kept especially for
nights like this. In spite of myself I kept imagining the officer
outside and how powdered he would be with snow when he came
in. But he never came. It was much beyond his usual time, and it
annoyed me to realize how my thoughts were taken up with him.
My niece was knitting slowly, with a concentrated air. <br>
<br>
At last we heard steps, but they came from inside the house. I
recognized the unequal tread of the officer, and I realized that he
had come in by the other door and was now on his way from his
room. No doubt he hadn’t wanted to appear before us unimpressive
in a wet uniform, and so he had changed first. <br>
<br>
The steps, a strong one, then a weak one, came down the
staircase. The door opened, and there was the officer. He was in
mufti, and was wearing a pair of thick grey flannel trousers and a
steel-blue tweed coat with a warm brown check. It was large and
loose-fitting and hung with easy carelessness. Beneath his coat a
cream woollen pull-over fitted tightly over his spare and muscular
body. <br>
<br>
“Excuse me,” he said. ‘Tm feeling cold. I got wet through, and
my room is very chilly. I will warm myself at your fire for a few
minutes.” With some difficulty he crouched down by the hearth,
put out his hands, and kept on turning them round. “That’s fine,”
he said, and moved round to warm his back at the fire, still
squatting and clasping one knee in his hands. <br>
<br>
“Here it’s nothing,” he said. ‘Winter in France is a mild season.
Where I come from, it’s very hard. Very. The trees are all firs,
dose-packed forests with the snow heavy on them. Here the trees
are delicate, and the snow on them is like lace. My home reminds
me of a powerful thickset bull which needs all its strength to keep
alive. Here everything is intelligence, and subtle poetic thought.”
His voice was rather colourless, with very little resonance, and
his accent was fairly slight, only noticeable on the harsher consonants.
<b>(p.75)</b> The general effect was of a kind of musical buzzing. He got up
and rested his arm on the top of the high chimney-piece, leaning his
forehead on the back of his hand. He was so tall that he had to stoop
a little, whereas I shouldn’t even have caught the top of my head
there. He remained for a long time without moving or saying
anything. My niece was knitting with machinelike energy, nor did
she once look up at him. I was smoking, half stretched out in my
big soft armchair. I imagined that nothing could disturb the weight
of our silence, that the man would bid us good-night and go. But
the muffled and musical buzzing began again; one couldn’t say that
it broke the silence, for it seemed to be born out of it. <br>
<br>
“I have always loved France,” said the officer without moving.
“Always. I was only a child in the last war, and what I thought then
doesn’t count. But ever since I have always loved it- only it was
from a distance, like the Princesse Lointaine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> He paused before
saying solemnly, “Because of my father.” <br>
<br>
He turned round with his hands in his coat-pockets and leant
against the side of the chimney-piece; he kept bumping his head a
little against the shelf. From time to time he slowly rubbed the back
of his head against it with a natural movement, like a stag’s. An
armchair was there for him just at hand, but he didn’t sit down.
Right up to the last day he never sat down. We never gave, nor did
he ever take, anything remotely like an opening for familiarity.
“Because of my father,” he repeated. “He was intensely patriotic.
The defeat was a great blow to him. And yet he loved France.
He liked Briand,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> he believed in the Weimar Republic<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> and in
Briand, and he was very enthusiastic. He used to say, ‘He is going
to unite us like husband and wife.’ He thought the sun was going to
rise over Europe at last.” <br>
<br>
While he was talking he was watching my niece. He did not look at
her as a man looks at a woman, but as he looks at a statue. And a statue
was exactly what she was - a living one, but a statue all the same.
“But Briand was defeated. My father saw that France was still
led by your heartless grands bourgeois - by people like your De
<b>(p.76)</b> Wendels,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> your Henri Bordeaux,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> and your old Marshal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> He
said to me, ‘You must never go to France till you can do it in
field-boots and a helmet.’ I had to promise him that, for he was
nearly dying, and when war broke out I knew the whole of Europe
except France.” <br>
<br>
He smiled, and said, as if that had been a reason: <br>
<br>
“I am a musician, you see.” <br>
<br>
A log fell in, and some embers rolled out from the hearth. The
German leant over and picked up the embers with the tongs; then
he went on: <br>
<br>
“I am not a performer. I am a composer. That is my whole life,
and so it’s comical for me to see myself as a man of war. And yet I
don’t regret this war. No. I think that great things will come of it.” <br>
<br>
He straightened himself, took his hands out of his pockets and
half raised them. <br>
<br>
“Forgive me: I may have said something to hurt you. But I was
saying what I think, and with sincere good feeling. I feel it because
of my love of France. Great things will come of it for Germany and
for France. I think, as my father did, that the sun is going to shine
over Europe.” <br>
<br>
He took a couple of steps and bowed slightly. As on every
evening he said, “I wish you a very good night.” Then he went
away. <br>
<br>
I finished my pipe in silence, then I coughed slightly and said,
“It’s perhaps too unkind to refuse him even a farthing’s worth of
answer.” My niece lifted her head. She raised her eyebrows very
high, her eyes were shining with indignation. <br>
<br>
Almost I felt myself blushing. <br>
<br>
From that day his visits took on a new shape. Very rarely indeed
did we see him in uniform; he used to change first and then knock
on our door. Was it to spare us the sight of the uniform of the
<b>(p.77)</b> enemy? or to make us forget it, to get us used to his personality?
No doubt a bit of both. He used to knock, and then he would come
in without waiting for the answer which he knew we would not
give. He did it in the simplest and most natural way, and would
warm himself at the fire, which was the excuse he always gave for
his arrival - an excuse by which none of us was taken in, and whose
useful conventionality he made no attempt to disguise. <br>
<br>
He did not come every evening without fail; but I do not
remember a single one in which he did not talk to us before he left.
He used to lean over the fire, and while he was warming some part
or other of himself at the blaze his droning voice would quietly
make itself heard and, for the rest of the evening, there was an
interminable monologue on the subjects - his country, music,
France - which were obsessing his mind; for not once did he try to
get an answer from us, or a sign of agreement or even a glance. He
used not to speak for long - never for much longer than on the first
evening. He would pronounce a few sentences, sometimes broken
by silences, and sometimes linking them up with the monotonous
continuity of a prayer; sometimes he leant against the chimney-piece
without moving, like a caryatid; sometimes, without interrupting
himself, he would go up to an object or a drawing on the wall.
Then he would be silent, bow to us, and wish us a good night. <br>
<br>
One day he said (it was in the early stages of his visits): “What is
the difference between the fire in my home and this one here?
Certainly the wood, the flame, and the fireplace are exactly alike.
But not the light. That depends on the things on which it shines -
the people in this smoking-room, the furniture, the walls, and the
books on their shelves ... <br>
<br>
“Why am I so fond of this room?” he went on thoughtfully. “It’s
not particularly beautiful- Oh, excuse me!” he laughed. “I mean to
say it’s not a museum piece ... Take your furniture: it does not
make one say, ‘What lovely things!’ No. And yet this room has a
soul. All this house has a soul!” <br>
<br>
He was standing in front of the shelves of the bookcase, and with
a light touch his fingers were fondling the bindings. <br>
<br>
“Balzac, Barres, Baudelaire, Beaumarchais, Boileau, Buffon ...<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
<b>(p.78)</b> Chateaubriand, Corneille, Descartes, Fenelon, Flaubert ...<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> La
Fontaine, France, Gautier, Hugo ...<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> What a roll-call!” he said,
shaking his head with a little laugh, “and I’ve only got as far as the
letter ‘H’! Not to Moliere, nor Rabelais, nor Racine, nor Pascal, nor
Stendhal, nor Voltaire, nor Montaigne,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> nor any of the others!”
He went on slowly moving along the bookshelves, and from time
to time he muttered an exclamation, I suppose when he came to a
name which he had not expected. “With the English,” he went on,
“one immediately thinks of Shakespeare; with the Italians, it is
Dante. Spain: Cervantes. And with us at once: Goethe.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> After that
one has to stop and consider. But if someone says, ‘And France?’
then who comes to the tip of one’s tongue? Moliere? Racine?
Hugo? Voltaire? Rabelais? Or which of the others? They jostle each
other like the crowd at the entrance to a theatre till you don’t know
which to let in first.” <br>
<br>
He tumed round, adding in all solemnity, “But when it comes to
music, then it’s our turn: Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Wagner,
Mozart ... <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> Which name comes first?” <br>
<br>
“And now we are at war with each other,” he said slowly,
shaking his head. He had come back to the fireplace, and he let his
eyes rest smiling on my niece’s profile. “But this is the last time!
We won’t fight each other any more. We’ll get married!” His
eyelids crinkled, the hollows under his cheekbones went into two
<b>(p.79)</b> long furrows and he showed his white teeth. “Yes, yes,” he said
gaily, and a little toss of the head repeated this affirmation. “When
we entered Saintes,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> he went on after a silence, “I was happy that
the population received us well. I was very happy. I thought: This
is going to be easy. And then I saw that it was not that at all, that it
was cowardice.” He became serious again. “I despised those people,
and for France’s sake I was afraid. I thought: Has she really got like
that?” He shook his head. “No, no, I have seen her since, and now I
am happy at her stern expression.” <br>
<br>
His gaze fell on mine. I looked away. It hesitated for a little at
various points in the room and then turned again on the unrelentingly
expressionless face which it had left. <br>
<br>
“I am happy to have found here an elderly man with some
dignity. and a young lady who knows how to be silent. We have
got to conquer this silence. We have got to conquer the silence of all
France. I am glad of that.” <br>
<br>
Silently, and with a grave insistence which still carried the hint of
a smile, he was looking at my niece, at her closed, obstinate,
delicate profile. My niece felt it, and I saw her blush slightly, and :1
little frown form gradually between her eyebrows. Her fingers
plucked the needle perhaps rather too quickly and tartly, at the risk
of breaking the thread. <br>
<br>
“Yes,” went on his slow, droning voice. “It’s better that way.
Much better. That makes for a solid union- for unions where both
sides gain in greatness ... There is a very lovely children’s story
which I have read, which you have read, which everybody has
read. I don’t know if it has the same title in both countries. With us
it’s called ‘Das Tier und die Schone’ - ‘Beauty and the Beast.’ Poor
Beauty! The Beast holds her at his pleasure, captive and powerlessat
every hour of the day he forces his oppressive and relentless
presence on her . . . Beauty is all pride and dignity - she has
hardened her heart . . . But the Beast is something better than he
seems. Oh, he’s not very polished, he’s clumsy and brutal, he
seems very uncouth beside his exquisite Beauty! But he has a heart. <br>
<br>
Yes, he has a heart which hopes to raise itself up . . . If Beauty only
would! But it is a long time before Beauty will. However, little by
little she discovers the light at the back of the eyes of her hated jailer
- the light which reveals his supplication and his love. She is less
<b>(p.80)</b> conscious of his heavy hand and of the chains of her prison ... She
ceases to hate him. His constancy moves her, she gives him her
hand .... At once the Beast is transformed, the spell which has
kept him m that brutish hide is broken: and now behold a hands<:>
me and chivalrous knight, sensitive and cultivated, whom every
kiss from his beauty adorns with more and more shining qualities!
Theu umon gives them the most perfect happiness. Their children,
who combine and mingle the gifts of their parents, are the loveliest
the earth has borne . . . <br>
<br>
“Weren’t ,rou fond of this story? For my part, I always loved it. I
have reread It over and over again. It used to make me cry. I loved
the Beast above all because I understood his misery. Even today I
am moved when I speak of it.” <br>
<br>
He was silent, then he took a deep breath and bowed.
“I wish you a very good night!” <br>
<br>
One evening when I had gone up into my room to look for my
tobacco I heard someone playing the harmonium: playing the
“Eighth Prelude and Fugue,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> which my niece had been practising
before the catastrophe. The score had remained open at that page,
but up to the evening in question my niece had not been able to
bring herself to go on with it. That she had begun again caused me
both pleasure and astonishment: what deep inward need could have
made her change her mind so suddenly? But it was not my niece for
she had not left her armchair or her work. Her eyes met mine
and sent me a message which I could not decipher. I looked at the
long back bowed over the instrument, the bent neck, the long,
delicate, nervous hands whose fingers changed places over the keys
as rapidly as If they had each a life of their own. <br>
<br>
He only played the Prelude, then he got up and came back to the
fire. <br>
<br>
“_There is nothing greater than that,” he said in his low voice,
which was hardly more than a whisper. “Great- that’s not quite
the word. Outside man - outside human flesh. That makes us
understand, no, not understand but guess . . . No: have a
presentiment . . . have a presentiment of what nature is . . . of
what- stripped bare- is the divine and unknowable nature of the
human soul. Yes, it’s inhuman music.” <br>
<br>
<b>(p.81)</b> He seemed to be following out his own train of thought in a
dreaming silence; he was slowly biting his lip. <br>
<br>
“Bach ... he could only be a German. Our country has that
character; that inhuman character. I mean - by ‘inhuman’ - that
which is on a different scale to man.”
Then, after a pause: <br>
<br>
“That kind of music - I love it, I admire it, it overwhelms me;
it’s like the presence of God in me ... but it’s not my own.
“For my part, I would like to compose music which is on the
scale of man; that also is a road by which one can reach the truth.
That’s my road. I don’t want to follow any other, and besides I
couldn’t. That, I know now; I know it to the full. Since when?
Since I have lived here.” <br>
<br>
He turned his back on us and leant his hands on the mantelpiece.
He gripped it with his fingers and held his face towards the fire
through his forearms, as if through the bars of a grating. His voice
became lower and even more droning. <br>
<br>
“Now I really need France. But I ask a great deal; I ask a
welcome from her. To be here as a stranger, as a traveller or a
conqueror, that’s nothing. France gives nothing then, for there is
nothing one can take from her. Her riches, her true riches, one can’t
conquer; one can only drink them in at her breast. She has to offer
you her breast, like a mother, in a movement of maternal
feeling . . . I know that that depends on us . . . but it depends on
her too. She must consent to understand our thirst, she must
consent to quench it, and she must consent to unite herself with
us.” <br>
<br>
He stood up, his back still turned to us, his fingers still gripping
the stone. “As for me,” he said a little more loudly, “I must live
here for a long time. In a house like this one. As a child of a village
like this village . . . I must . . . “ <br>
<br>
He was silent. He turned towards us. He smiled with his mouth,
but not with his eyes, which were looking at my niece. <br>
<br>
“We will overcome all obstacles,” he said. “Sincerity is bound to
overcome all obstacles.” <br>
<br>
“I wish you a very good night!” <br>
<br>
I can’t remember today everything that was said during the course
of more than a hundred winter evenings, but the theme hardly ever
varied; it was the long rhapsody of his discovery of France: how he
<b>(p.82)</b> had loved her from afar before he came to know her, and how his
love had grown every day since he had had the luck to live there.
And believe me, I admired him for it. Yes, because nothing seemed
to discourage him, and because he never tried to shake off our
inexorable silence by any violent expression . . . On the contrary,
when he sometimes let the silence invade the whole room and, like
a heavy unbreathable gas, saturate every corner of it, of the three of
us it was he who used to seem most at ease. Then .he would look at
my niece with that expression of approval which was both solemn
and smiling at the same time, and which he had kept ever since his
first day, and I would feel the spirit of my niece being troubled in
that prism which s?e had herself built for it. I would notice it by
several signs, of which the least was a faint fluttering of her fingers,
and so when at last Werner von Ebrennac set the silence draining
away gently and smoothly with his droning voice, he seemed to
make it possible for me to breathe more freely. <br>
<br>
He would often talk about himself: “My house is in the forest; I
was born there; I used to go to the village school on the other side; I
never left home until I went to Munich for my examinations, and
to Salzburg for the music. I’ve lived there ever since. I don’t like big
cities. I know London, Vienna, Rome, Warsaw, and, of course, the
German towns, but I would not like to live in any of them. The
only place I really liked was Prague - no other city has such a soul.
And above all Nuremberg.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> For a German it is the city which
makes his heart swell because there he finds the ghosts which are
dear to his soul. Every stone is a reminder of those who made the
glory of the old Germany. I think the French must feel the same
thing before the Cathedral of Chartres.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> There they too must feel
the presence of their ancestors beside them, the beauty of their
spirit, the greatness of their faith, and all their graciousness. Fate led
me to Chartres. Oh, truly, when it appears over the ripe corn, blue
m the distance, transparent, ethereal, it stirs one’s heart! I imagined
the feelings of those who used to go there on foot, on horseback or
by wagon in the olden time. I shared their feelings, and I loved
those people. How I wish I could be their brother!” <br>
<br>
His face grew stern: “No doubt. it’s hard to believe that of
<b>(p.83)</b> somebody who arrived at Chartres in a huge armoured car; but all
the same it’s the truth. So many things are going on at the same
time in the heart of a German, even the best German! Things of
which he would so gladly be cured.” He smiled again, a faint smile
which slowly lit up all his face; then he said: <br>
<br>
“In the country house nearest my home there lives a young girl.
She is very beautiful and very sweet. My father at any rate would
have been very glad if I had married her. When he died we were
practically engaged, and they used to let us go out for long walks
alone together.” <br>
<br>
My niece had just snapped her thread, and before going on he
waited until she had threaded her needle again. She did it with great
concentration, but the eye of the needle was very small and it was
no easy matter. Finally she succeeded. <br>
<br>
“One day,” he went on, “we were in the forest. Rabbits and
squirrels scampered before us. All kinds of flowers were there,
narcissus, wild hyacinth, and amaryllis. The young girl cried out in
her joy. She said, ‘I’m so happy, Werner. I love, oh, how I love
these gifts from God!’ I too was happy. We lay down on the moss
in the midst of the bracken. We did not say a word. Above our
heads we saw the tops of the fu trees swaying and the birds flying
from branch to branch. The young girl gave a little cry: ‘Oh, he’s
stung me on the chin! Dirty little beast, nasty little mosquito!’ Then
I saw her make a quick grab with her hand. ‘I have caught one,
Werner! Oh, look, I’m going to punish him: I’m- pulling- his legs
- off- one - after - the - other . . . ‘ And she did so . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a>
“Luckily,” he went on, “she had plenty of other suitors. I did not
feel any remorse, but at the same time I was scared away for ever
where German girls were concerned.” <br>
<br>
He looked thoughtfully at the inside of his hands and said:
“And that’s what our politicians are like too. That’s why I never
wanted to associate with them in spite of my friends who wrote to
me: ‘Come and join us.’ No: I preferred to stay at home always. It
wasn’t a good thing for the success of my music, but no matter:
success is a very little thing compared to a quiet conscience. And
indeed I know very well that my friends and our Führer have the
grandest and the noblest conceptions, but I know equally well that
<b>(p.84)</b> they would pull mosquitoes’ legs off, one after the other. That’s
what always happens with Germans when they are very lonely: it
always comes up to the top. And who are more lonely than men of
the same Party when they are in power?” <br>
<br>
“Happily they are now alone no longer: they are in France.
France will cure them, and I’m going to tell you the truth: they
know it. They know that France will teach them how to be really
great and pure in heart.” <br>
<br>
He went towards the door and said, swallowing his words as if
talking to himself: <br>
<br>
“But for that we must have love.” <br>
<br>
He held the door open for a moment and, looking over his
shoulder, he gazed at my niece’s neck as she leant over her work, at
the pale, fragile nape of her neck whence the hair went up in coils of
dark mahogany, and then he added in a tone of quiet determination: <br>
<br>
“A love which is returned.” <br>
<br>
Then he turned his head, and the door closed on him as he
rapidly uttered his evening formula: <br>
<br>
“I wish you a very good night.” <br>
<br>
The long spring days came at last, and now the officer came down
with the last rays of the setting sun. He still wore his grey flannel
trousers, but he had on his shoulders a lighter woollen jacket, the
colour of tough homespun, over a linen shirt with an open neck.
One evening he came down holding a book with his forefinger
closed in it. His face brightened with that half-withheld smile
which foreshadows the pleasure we are confident of giving others.
He said: <br>
<br>
“I brought this down for you. It’s a page of Macbeth. Ye gods,
what greatness!” <br>
<br>
He opened the book: <br>
<br>
“It’s at the end. Macbeth’s power is slipping through his fingers,
and with it the loyalty of those who have grasped at last the
blackness of his ambition. The noble lords who are defending the
honour of Scotland are awaiting his imminent overthrow. One of
them describes the dramatic portents of this collapse .
And he read slowly, with a pathetic heaviness: <br>
<br>
<b>(p.85)</b> “Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.” <br>
<br>
He raised his head and laughed. I wondered with stupefaction if
he was thinking of the same tyrant as I was, but he said:
“Isn’t that just what must be keeping your Adrniral<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> awake at
night? I really pity that man in spite of the contempt which he
inspires in me as much as in you.” <br>
<br>
“Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love ... “ <br>
<br>
“A leader who has not his people’s love is a very miserable little
puppet. Only ... only, could one expect anything else? Who in
fact except some dreary climber of that kind could have taken on
such a part? And yet it had to be. Yes, there had to be someone who
would agree to sell his country, because today - today and for a
long time to come- France cannot fall willingly into our open arms
without losing her dignity in her own eyes. Often the most sordid
go-between is thus at the bottom of the happiest union. The
go-between is none the less contemptible for that, nor is the union
less happy.” <br>
<br>
He closed the book with a snap and stuffed it in his coat pocket,
mechanically giving the pocket a couple of slaps with the palm of
his hand. Then he said with a cheerful expression lighting up his
long face: <br>
<br>
“I have to inform my hosts that I shall be away for a couple of
weeks. I am overjoyed to be going to Paris. It’s now my tum for
leave, and I shall spend it in Paris for the first time. This is a great
day for me. It’s my greatest day until the coming of another one,
for which I hope with all my heart, and which will be an even
<b>(p.86)</b> greater day. I shall know how to wait for years if necessary. My
heart knows how to be patient.” <br>
<br>
“I expect I shall see my friends in Paris, where many of them
have come for the negotiations which we are conducting with your
politicians to prepare for the wonderful union of our two countries.
So I shall be in a way a witness to the marriage . . . I want to tell
you that I am happy for the sake of France, whose wounds will thus
be so quickly healed, but I am even happier for Germany and for
myself. No one will ever have gained so much from a good deed as
will Germany by giving back to France her greatness and her
liberty!” <br>
<br>
“I wish you a very good night.” <br>
<br>
<b>(p.87)</b>

II <br>
<br>
We did not set eyes on him when he came back.
We knew he was there (there are many signs which betray the
presence of a guest in the house, even when he remains invisible). But
for a number of days- much more than a week- we never saw him.
Shall I admit it? His absence did not leave my mind at peace. I
thought of him, I don’t know how far it wasn’t with regret or
anxiety. Neither I nor my niece spoke of him. But in the evening
when we sometimes heard the dull echo of his uneven step upstairs
I could clearly see from her sudden obstinate busying with her
work, from the faint lines that gave her face an expression which
was both set and expectant, that she was not immune from
thoughts like mine. <br>
<br>
One day I had to go to the Kommandantur<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> for some business
about declaring tires.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> While I was filling in the form they had
given me, Werner von Ebrennac came out of his office. At first he
did not see me. He spoke to the sergeant who was sitting at a little
table before a long mirror on the wall. I heard the singsong
inflection of his low voice, and, although I had nothing more to do,
I waited there without knowing why, yet curiously moved, and
expecting I know not what climax. I saw his face in the mirror, it
seemed pale and drawn. He raised his eyes until they caught my
own. For two seconds we stared at each other, then he suddenly
turned on his heel and faced me. His lips parted, and slowly he
raised his hand a little, then almost immediately let it fall again. He
shook his head almost imperceptibly with a kind of pathetic irresolution,
as if he had said ‘No’ to himself, yet never taking his
eyes off me. Then he made a very slight bow, as he let his glance
fall to the ground, hobbled back into his office, and shut himself in.
I said nothing of this to my niece, but women have a catlike 
<b>(p.88)</b> ~o~er of divination; for the whole evening she never stopped
lifting her eyes from her work every minute to look at me; to try to
read something in my face, which I forced myself to keep expressionless
by pulling assiduously at my pipe. In the end she let
her hands drop as if tired and, folding up her material, asked if I
minded her having an early night. She passed two fingers slowly
over her forehead, as if to drive away a headache. She kissed me
good-night, and I thought I could read a reproach and a somewhat
oppressive sadness in her beautiful grey eyes. After she had gone a
ridiculous anger took possession of me: a rage at being ridiculous,
and at having a niece who was ridiculous. What was the point of all
this nonsense? But I could give no answer to myself. If it was
nonsense its roots all the same went very deep. <br>
<br>
It was three days later that, just as we were finishing our coffee,
we heard the irregular beat of his familiar steps grow clear; and this
time they were obviously bent in our direction. l suddenly remembered
that winter evening six months ago when we first heard
those steps. I thought, And it’s raining today too- for it had been
raining hard all the morning. A long-drawn, obstinate downpour
which drowned everything outside and was even bathing the inside
of the house in a cold and clammy atmosphere. My niece had
covered her shoulders with a scented silk scarf where ten disturbing
hands drawn by Jean Cocteau were limply pointing at each other;
as for me, I was warming my hands on the bowl of my pipe- and
to think we were in July! <br>
<br>
The steps crossed the anteroom and began to make the stairs
creak. The man was coming down gradually with a slowness
which seemed to increase, not as if a prey to hesitation, but like
somebody whose will-power was being strained to the utmost. My
niece had raised her head and was looking at me; during all this
time she fixed on me the transparent, inhuman stare of a horned
owl. And when the last stair creaked, and a long silence followed,
her fixed expression vanished, I saw her eyelids grow heavy, her
head bend and all her body fall back wearily into the armchair.
I don’t believe that the silence lasted more than a few seconds, yet
they seemed very long. I felt I could see the man behind the door,
with his forefinger raised to knock and yet putting back, putting
back the moment when by the mere gesture of knocking he would
have to face the future ... At last he knocked. And it was neither
<b>(p.89)</b> the gentle knock of someone hesitating nor the sharp knock of
nervousness overcome; they were three full, slow knocks, the calm
sure knocks that mean a decision from which there is no going
back. I expected to see the door open at once as on other occasions,
but it remained closed; and then an uncontrollable agitation took
possession of me, a medley of questioning and of wavering between
conflicting impulses, which every one of the seconds that
went by with what seemed to me the increasing velocity of a
cataract only made more confused and inextricable. Ought we to
answer? Why this sudden change? Why should he expect us this
evening to break the silence whose healthy obstinacy had had his
full approval, as his behaviour up to now had shown? This evening
- this very evening- what was it that our dignity demanded of us?
I looked at my niece to try to catch from her eyes some prompting,
some sign, but I met only her side-face. She was watching the
handle of the door. She was watching it with that inhuman,
owl-like stare which I had noticed already; she was very pale, and I
saw her upper lip draw itself tight with pain over the delicate white
line of her teeth. For my part, before this inward drama so suddenly
revealed to me, something that went so far beyond the mild
twinges of my own irresolution, I lost all resistance. At that
moment two new knocks came, two only, two quick and gentle
knocks, and my niece said, “He is going to leave,” in a voice so low
and so utterly disheartened that I did not wait any longer and said
loudly: “Come in, sir.” <br>
<br>
Why did I add “sir”? To show that I was asking him in as a man
and not as an enemy officer? Or, on the contrary, to show that I
knew very well who had knocked, and that the words were
addressed to him? I don’t know, and it doesn’t matter. The fact
remains that I said “Come in, sir” and that he entered. <br>
<br>
I had expected to see him appear in civilian clothes, but he was in
uniform. Rather would I say that he was more in uniform than
ever, if that will convey that it was quite clear to me that he had
donned this attire with the deliberate intention of thrusting it on us.
He had pushed the door back to the wall, and he was standing
straight up in the doorway, so erect and so stiff that I almost began
to doubt if it was the same man in front of me and, for the first
time, I noticed how surprisingly he resembled Louis Jouvet, the
actor.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> He stood like that for a few seconds, stiff, straight, and
<b>(p.90)</b> silent, his feet a little apart and his arms hanging inert beside his
body, his face so cold and so completely impassive that it did not
seem as if the slightest emotion could ever dwell there. <br>
<br>
But seated as I was deep in my armchair and with my face on a
level with his left hand, l noticed that hand; my eyes were caught
by that hand, and they stayed there as if chained to it, because of the
pathetic spectacle it offered me, and which touchingly belied the
man’s whole attitude .... <br>
<br>
I learnt that day that, to anyone who knows how to observe
them, the hands can betray emotions as clearly as the face- as well
as the face, and better - for they are not so subject to the control of
the will. And the fingers of that hand were stretching and bending,
were squeezing and clutching, were abandoning themselves to the
most violent mimicry, while his face and his whole body remained
controlled and motionless. <br>
<br>
Then his eyes seemed to come back to life. They rested on me for
a moment; l felt as if I had been marked down by a falcon. They
were eyes shining between stiff wide-open eyelids, the eyelids, stiff
and crumpled at the same time, of a victim to insomnia. Then they
rested on my niece- and never left her. <br>
<br>
At last his hand grew still, all the fingers bent and clenched in the
palm. His mouth opened, and the lips as they separated made a
little noise like the uncorking of an empty bottle, then the officer
said in a voice that was more toneless than ever: <br>
<br>
“l have something very serious to say to you.” <br>
<br>
My niece sat facing him, but she lowered her head. She twisted
round her fingers the wool from her ball, which came unwound as
it rolled onto the carpet; this ridiculous task being doubtless the
only one that would lend itself to being performed without her
giving it a thought - and spare her any shame. <br>
<br>
The officer went on - with such a visible effort that it seemed it
might be costing him his life: <br>
<br>
“Everything that l have said in these six months, everything that
the walls of this room have heard ... “ He took a deep breath as
laboriously as an asthmatic and kept his lungs full for a moment.
“You must ... “ He breathed out again: “You must forget it all.”
The girl slowly let her hands fall into the hollow of her skirt
where they remained lying helplessly on their sides like boats
stranded on the sand; and slowly she raised her head, and then, for
the first time- for the very first time- she gave the officer the full
gaze of her pale eyes. <br>
<br>
<b>(p.91)</b> He said, so that I scarcely heard him, in less than a whisper, “Oh,
welch’ ein Licht!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> And, as ifhis eyes were really unable to endure
that light, he hid them behind his wrist. Two seconds went by;
then he let his hand fall, but he had lowered his eyelids and now it
was his turn to keep his gaze fixed on the ground. . . . <br>
<br>
His lips made the same little noise, and then he said in a voice that
went down, down, down: <br>
<br>
“I have seen those men - the victors.” Then, after several
seconds, in a still lower voice: <br>
<br>
“I have spoken to them.” And at last in a whisper, slowly and
bitterly: <br>
<br>
“They laughed at me.” <br>
<br>
He raised his eyes to me and gravely nodded his head three times,
almost imperceptibly. He closed his eyes, then said: <br>
<br>
“They said to me: ‘Haven’t you grasped that we’re having them
on?’ That’s what they said. Those very words. ‘Wir prellen sie.’
They said to me: ‘You don’t suppose that we’re going to be such
fools as to let France rise up again on our frontiers? Do you?’ They
gave a loud laugh and slapped me merrily on the back as they
looked at my face: ‘We aren’t musicians!’” <br>
<br>
As he spoke these last words his voice betrayed an obscure
contempt which might have been the reflection of his own feelings
towards the others or simply the echo of the very tone in which
they had spoken. <br>
<br>
“Then I made a long speech - and a spirited one too. They went:
‘Tst! Tst!’ They answered me: ‘Politics aren’t a poet’s dream. What
do you think we went to war for? For the sake of their old
Marshal?’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> They laughed again. ‘We’re neither madmen nor
simpletons: we have the chance to destroy France, and destroy her
we will. Not only her material power: her soul as well. Particularly
her soul. Her soul is the greatest danger. That’s our job at this
moment- make no mistake about it, my dear fellow! We’ll turn it
rotten with our smiles and our consideration. We’ll make a
grovelling bitch of her.’” <br>
<br>
He was silent. He seemed out of breath. He clenched his jaw
with such force that I saw his cheekbones stand out and a vein,
thick and winding as a worm, beat under his temple. Suddenly all
the skin of his face moved in a sort of underground shiver - as a 
<b>(p.92)</b> puff of wind moves a lake; as with the first bubbles the film of
cream thickens on the surface of the milk one is boiling. His eyes
met the pale, wide-open eyes of my niece:, and he said in a low
voice, level, intense, and constrained, almost too overburdened to
move: <br>
<br>
“There is no hope.” And in a voice which was even lower, more
slow and more toneless, as if to torture himself with the intolerable
but established fact: “No hope. No hope.” Then suddenly in a
voice which was unexpectedly loud and strong and, to my surprise,
clear and ringing as a trumpet call, as a cry: “No hope!”
After that, silence. <br>
<br>
I thought I heard him laugh. His forehead, racked with anguish,
was as wrinkled as a hawser. His lips trembled - the pale yet
fevered lips of a sick man. <br>
<br>
“They reproached me, they were rather angry with me: ‘There
you are, you see! You see how infatuated you are with her. There’s
the real danger! But we’ll rid Europe of this pest! We’ll purge it of
this poison!’ They’ve explained everything to me. Oh, they’ve not
left me in the dark about anything. They are flattering your writers,
but at the same time in Belgium, in Holland, in all the countries
occupied by our troops, they’ve already put the bars up. No French
book can go through any more except technical publications,
manuals on Refraction or formulas for Cementation . . . But
works of general culture, not one. None whatever!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> <br>
<br>
His glance passed above my head, flitting about and coming up
against the corners of the room like a lost night-bird. At last it
seemed to find sanctuary in the darkest shelves - those. where
Racine, Ronsard, Rousseau<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> were aligned. His eyes stayed fixed
there, and his voice went on with a groaning violence: <br>
<br>
“Nothing, nothing, nobody!” And as if we hadn’t yet understood
or weighed the full measure of the threat: “Not only your
modern writers! Not only your Peguy, your Proust, your
Bergson . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> But all the others! All those up there! The whole lot!
Every one.”

<b>(p.93)</b> His glance once more swept over the bindings which glittered
softly in the twilight, with a kind of desperate caress. “They will
put out the light altogether,” he cried. “Never again will Europe be
lit up by that flame.” And his grave hollow voice made my breast
echo with an unexpected and startling cry, a cry whose last syllable
seemed drawn out into a wail. <br>
<br>
‘‘Nevermore!’’ <br>
<br>
Once more the silence fell. Once more, but this time how much
more tense and thick! Underneath our silences of the past I had
indeed felt the submarine life of hidden emotions, conflicting and
contradictory desires and thoughts swarming away like the warring
creatures of the sea under the calm surface of the water. But
beneath this silence, alas! there was nothing but a terrible sense of
oppression. At last his voice broke the silence. It was gentle and
distressed: <br>
<br>
“I had a friend. He was like a brother. We had been to school
together. We shared the same room at Stuttgart. We had spent
three months together in Nuremberg. We never did anything
without each other: I played my music to him; he read me his
poems. He was sensitive and romantic. But he left me. He went to
read his poems at Munich,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> to some of his new friends. It was he
who used always to be writing to me to come and join them. It was
he that I saw in Paris with his friends. I have seen what they have
made of him!” <br>
<br>
He slowly shook his head as if he had to return a sorrowful
refusal to some request. <br>
<br>
“He was the most violent of them all. He mingled anger with
mockery. One moment he would look at me with passion and cry:
‘It’s a poison! We’ve got to empty the creature of its poison!’ The
next moment he would give me little prods in the stomach with the
end of his finger. ‘They’re scared stiff now, ha-ha! They’re afraid of
their pockets and for their stomach - for their trade and industry!
That’s all they think of! And as for the few others, we’ll flatter
them and put them to sleep, ha-ha! It will be easy!’ He laughed at
me till he went pink in the face. ‘We’ll buy their soul for a mess of
pottage!’” <br>
<br>
Werner paused for breath. <br>
<br>
“I said to him: ‘Have you grasped what you are doing? Have you 
<b>(p.94)</b> really grasped what it means?’ He said, ‘Do you think that is going
to frighten us? Not with our kind of clearheadedness!’ I said: ‘Then
you mean to seal up the tomb - and for ever?’ He replied, ‘It’s a
matter of life or death. Force is all you need to conquer with, but
it’s not enough to keep you masters. We know very well that an
army counts for nothing in keeping you masters.’ ‘But at the price
of the Spirit!’ I cried. ‘Not at that price!’ ‘The Spirit never dies,’ he
said. ‘It has known it all before. It is born again from its ashes.
We’ve got to build for a thousand years hence: first we must
destroy.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> I looked at him. I looked right down into his pale eyes.
He was quite sincere. That’s the most terrible thing of all.”
His eyes opened very wide, as if at the spectacle of some appalling
murder: “They’ll do what they say!” he cried, as if we wouldn’t
have believed him. “They’ll do it systematically and doggedly. I
know how those devils stop at nothing.” <br>
<br>
He shook his head like a dog with a bad ear. A murmur came
from between his clenched teeth, the plaintive, passionate moan of
the betrayed lover. <br>
<br>
He hadn’t moved. He was still standing rigidly and stiffly in the
opening of the door, with his arms stretched out as if they had to
carry hands of lead, and he was pale - not like wax, but like the
plaster of certain decaying walls: grey, with whiter stains of saltpetre.
I saw him stoop slowly. He raised his hand and held it forward,
palm down, towards my niece and myself, with the fingers a little
bent. He clenched it and moved it up and down a little, while the
expression on his face tightened with a kind of fierce energy. His
lips parted, and I don’t know what kind of appeal I thought he was
going to make to us: I thought- yes, I thought that he was going to
exhort us to rebel. But not a word crossed his lips. His mouth
closed, and once again his eyes closed too. He stood up straight.
His hands rose up the Length of his body and, when they reached
the level of his face, performed some unintelligible movements,
something like certain figures in a Javanese religious dance. Then
he seized his forehead and his temples, pressing down his eyelids
with his stretched-out little fingers. <br>
<br>
“They said to me: ‘It’s our right and our duty.’ Our duty! ...
Happy is the man who discovers the path of his duty as easily as
that.” <br>
<br>
<b>(p.95)</b> He let his hands fall. <br>
<br>
“At the crossroads you are told: ‘Take that road there.’” He
shook his head. “Well, that road doesn’t lead up to the shining
heights of the mountain-crest. One sees it going down to a gloomy
valley and losing itself in the foul darkness of a dismal forest! . . .
0 God! Show me where my duty lies!” <br>
<br>
He said- he almost shouted: “It is the Fight- it’s the Great Battle
of the Temporal with the Spiritual.” <br>
<br>
With pitiful insistency he fixed his eyes on the wooden angel
carved above the window. The ecstatic, smiling angel, radiant with
celestial calm.<br>
<br>
Suddenly his expression seemed to relax, his body lost its stiffness,
his face dropped a little towards the ground, he raised it. <br>
<br>
“I stood on my rights,” he said more naturally. “I applied to be
reposted to a fighting unit, and at last they’ve granted me the
favour. I am authorized to set off tomorrow.” <br>
<br>
I thought I saw the ghost of a smile on his lips when he amplified
this with: <br>
<br>
“Off to Hell.” <br>
<br>
He raised his arm towards the east - towards those vast plains
where the wheat of the future will be fed on corpses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a>
My niece’s face gave me a shock: it was as pale as the moon. Her
lips, like the rim of an opaline vase, were wide open, almost in the
grimace of the Greek tragic masks, and, at the line where the hair
rose from the forehead, I saw beads of sweat- not slowly gather,
but gush out - yes, gush out. <br>
<br>
I don’t know if Werner von Ebrennac noticed. The pupils ofhis
eyes and those of the girl seemed moored to each other, as a boat in
a current is tied to a ring on the bank, and moored moreover by a
line so tightly stretched that one would not have dared to pass a
finger between the pairs of eyes: Ebrennac with one hand had taken
hold of the door-handle; with his other he held the side of the
doorway. Without moving his gaze a hair’s-breadth, he slowly
drew the door towards him. He said - in a voice that was strangely
devoid of expression: “I wish you a very good night.” <br>
<br>
I thought that he was going to close the door and go; but not at
all. He was looking at my niece. He looked at her, and said, or
rather whispered, “Adieu.” <br>
<br>
He did not move; he remained quite motionless, and in his
<b>(p.96)</b> strained and motionless face his eyes were the most strained and
motionless things of all, for they were bound to other eyes - too
wide open, too pale- the eyes of my niece. That lasted and lastedhow
long? - lasted right up to the moment when at length the girl
moved her lips. Wemer’s eyes glittered. I heard: <br>
<br>
“Adieu.” <br>
<br>
One could not have heard the word if one had not been waiting
for it, but at last I did hear it. Von Ebrennac heard it too, and he
drew himself up, and his face and his whole body seemed to relax
as if they had taken a soothing bath. <br>
<br>
He smiled, and in such a way that the last picture I had of him
was a smiling one; then the door closed and his steps died away in
the depths of the house. <br>
<br>
The next day, when I came down to have my morning glass of
milk, he was gone. My niece had got breakfast ready as she always
did. She helped me to it in silence, and in silence we drank.
Outside, a pale sun was shining through the mist. It struck me as
being very cold. <br>
