In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, he stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882 in a few hours, with the governor Hoàng Diệu committing suicide having sent a note of apology to the emperor. Although Rivière subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force was greeted with alarm in both Vietnam and China.<br><br>The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivière with its own ramshackle army, enlisted the help of <b>Liu Yongfu</b>, commander of the well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers.

Towards the end of the battle a French cannon overturned with the shock of its recoil, and Rivière and his officers rushed forward to help the gunners to right it. The Black Flags fired a volley into this struggling mass of men, killing one French officer and seriously wounding Rivière in the shoulder. Several seconds later, Rivière collapsed. Seeing the French line in confusion, the Black Flags surged forward and drove back the French rearguard. Several French officers were wounded at this critical moment, and in the confusion of the retreat Rivière’s body was abandoned on the battlefield.

<h1><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-120">Defining French Influence in Indochina</a></h1>

<p>
No corner of the French empire offers a better example of how Catholic missionaries
could see republican colonizers as Johnnies-come-lately than Indochina.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> 
In the 1870s, when republicans started showing an interest in
expanding France’s hold on Southeast Asia (Cochinchina was already a possession
and Cambodia a protectorate), missionaries of the Société des missions
étrangères de Paris had been working in the region for more than two
centuries. Despite their conflicts with Catholicism at home—this was the decade
Gambetta declared clericalism to be the enemy—republican supporters
of colonial expansion celebrated the missionary legacy. As the historian
Stephen Roberts put it, “France successfully raked history for proofs of her
interest in Indo-China.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>  Even 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-206">Jules Ferry</a>, who spearheaded the campaign to
limit Catholic influence at home, pointed to the long history of missionary
work as evidence of a proud “French” tradition in the region.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a>  Abroad, it
seemed, France had no greater champion than the Catholic missionaries of
Southeast Asia.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the nineteenth century, in times of religious conflict, Catholic
workers regularly sought French diplomatic and military support to defend
what they considered to be their right to evangelize. By the second half of the
nineteenth century, to expedite official intervention, apostolic vicars often
described their converts as wholeheartedly devoted to the French cause. A
particularly vigorous advocate of Catholic converts’ love of France was 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Mgr. Paul François Puginier</a>, arguably the most politically engaged apostolic vicar
of Tonkin that Hanoi ever saw. In 1884, at a moment when the missions faced
particularly violent opposition, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> warned French officials that
mandarins—Vietnamese officials who administered much of the day-to-day
functioning of the protectorate—wanted to “exterminate Christians” because
they saw them as friends of France. In his correspondence with officials,
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> turned his converts into dedicated patriots. “Yes, I can say it,”
he wrote in one report, “our neophytes have always loved and still love
France.” In return for their mistreatment, he added, his Christians deserved
the justice that only French gunships could deliver.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>
</p>
<p>
Such patriotic declarations have led historians of French Indochina to portray
missionaries as crucial facilitators of colonial expansion.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> In the years
before an official colonial presence in the region, it is, often argued, French
missionaries were their nation’s de facto representatives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> At times of violent
resistance, missionaries counted on French military intervention to protect
them. In return, missionaries often offered military and, later, colonial officials
key services as translators, cultural intermediaries, and guides. Protection
of missionaries gave French officials a justification for intervening in
Vietnamese affairs, and—most historians concur—led to a permanent colonial
presence in Indochina. There is, no doubt, much validity to this story:
throughout the nineteenth century, the more French troops defended against
anti-Christian violence, the more likely they were to stay in the region. But in
portraying missionaries as eager collaborators of colonial expansion, historians
take for granted that religious workers wanted to live under French colonial
rule—a fact, as this chapter will show, that many Frenchmen at the time
doubted greatly.
</p>

<p>
In the late 1880s, with the founding of the Union of Indochina, the expanding
ranks of French civil administrators in Indochina brought the prospect of
a long coexistence of republicans, colonists, and missionaries, provoking concern
on all sides. For missionaries, a sustained official presence raised the
specter of government interference, regulation, or, worst of all, prohibition.
Administrators, in turn, wondered whether missionaries, with their considerable
knowledge of Vietnamese society and sway over many Christian villages,
benefited the colonial cause or made French rule all the more precarious. Although
anticlerical critics questioned missionary allegiance in literally every
possession in the French empire, the deep regional roots of Catholicism made
the issue most pressing in Vietnam. At the founding of the Union of Indochina,
the Missions étrangères counted more than 270,000 Catholics in Tonkin and
Annam, and more than 90,000 in Cochinchina.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Nowhere did French missions
possess a longer history or a more developed operation.
</p>

<p>
From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s, when Frenchmen in Indochina debated
missionary contributions to the colonial effort, it was always in terms
of whether they helped spread “French influence”—always a nebulous
phrase. While the pro-colonial politicians in France spoke of the nation’s civilizing
goals, officials in Indochina focused on the practical necessities of
establishing colonial rule. As a result, security and allegiance trumped all
other concerns, from fulfilling abstract colonial aspirations like the civilizing
mission to exporting the anticlerical policies propounded by republicans at
home. In the colony, high-ranking officials and bishops vowed to keep conflict
between local administrators and missionaries to a minimum. But the awkward
alliance did not hold everywhere. Away from the major towns, beyond
the shadows of the cathedrals and halls of government, relations between missionaries
and administrators in the countryside were plagued by ideological
differences, mutual suspicion, and even petty jealousies.
</p>

<p>
These debates over Catholic influence heralded significant changes in both
long-held missionary and republican attitudes and practices. In the 1880s,
when officials increasingly questioned missionary allegiance to France, religious
workers were forced to abandon their self-styled image as homeless soldiers
of God and to enter the profane realm of public opinion. When pressed,
missionaries on the defensive associated the spread of influence with providing
intelligence, helping official expeditions and scientific missions, and
acting as guides and translators. They often embellished their records of cooperation
with declarations of patriotism. Nowhere was this better exemplified
than in the central highlands of Vietnam, where a mission under
suspicion of committing treason defended itself with flamboyant proclamations
of love for France. Such a formula ultimately sufficed for the colonial
government. But a group of critics, composed of lower-ranking officials and
colonists, suspected – often with good reason – that when the missions professed
love for the <i>patrie</i>, it was not for the republic but for a potentially subversive
counterrevolutionary vision of a bygone France.
</p>
<h2> Past and Present: Religious Violence and French Colonialism </h2>


<p>
When <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-206">Jules Ferry</a> invoked the long history of French missionaries in Indochina,
he was referring in large part to the waning years of the eighteenth
century.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> In 1787, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Pigneau de Béhaine</a>, a French bishop working in Cochinchina,
traveled to Versailles to elicit support from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-207">Louis XVI</a> for Nguyen Anh.
A struggling prince who had lost his family’s patrimony to a domestic rebellion,
Nguyen Anh remained neutral toward Christianity but held Pigneau in
high regard, hoping he would help him regain his power.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Pigneau’s</a> trip to
Versailles was perhaps most memorable because he brought with him
Nguyen Anh’s young son, Prince Canh, whose presence caused much talk
and amusement. A century later, many Frenchmen – Catholic and republican
alike—mythologized the bishop’s visit as proof of a deep bond between
France and Vietnam.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Bishop Pigneau’s</a> turn to his native France for help, however, was primarily
made out of despair for the future of Christianity, not out of his desire to
see his <i>patrie</i> spread its political influence in the region. The bishop had in
fact first turned to the Portuguese for military assistance. The Portuguese
military presence in the region, combined with their sympathy for the
Catholic cause, made them an obvious choice. But the Portuguese refused
the bishop’s request. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-207">Louis XVI</a>—<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Pigneau’s</a> second choice—ultimately 
signed a treaty offering military assistance for Nguyen Anh, a pledge that
was never honored. Upon returning to the region from Versailles, Pigneau
found Nguyen Anh struggling. In haste, the bishop raised his own small
army and helped the Vietnamese leader defeat his foes. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Pigneau de Béhaine</a>
died before seeing Nguyen Anh take the title of Emperor Gia Long, but 
he left behind an ambiguous partnership between Catholic missionaries, the
Vietnamese throne, and the French crown—a history of collaboration that
rested largely on a memorable appearance at court by a Vietnamese child
and on an unfulfilled promise for military assistance.
</p> 

<p>
It was not until the 1840s that the protectorate of the Catholic missions
drove France to significant political and military involvement in eastern
Asia. For the next two decades, anti-Christian violence witnessed the killing
of tens of thousands of Vietnamese converts, as well as the imprisonment,
torture, and execution of missionaries. Such violent episodes, combined with
increasing French interest in the economic possibilities of trade with China,
brought French ships into confrontation with Vietnamese forces and inspired
French policymakers, including <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-208">Napoleon III</a>, to seek a permanent foothold
in the region. By 1862, French attacks resulted in the taking of Saigon and
outlying provinces in Cochinchina. Within two years, the French had declared
a protectorate over neighboring Cambodia, as well. A small group of
pro-colonial commentators started envisioning Indochina as France’s answer
to the British Raj.
</p>

<p>
While military men and merchants interested in political prestige and economic
profit drove French expansion into Indochina, the plight of Vietnamese
Catholics remained a looming issue throughout the period. In some
instances, such as during <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-213">Francis Garnier’s</a> 1873-74 invasion of Tonkin, Vietnamese
Catholics fought on the side of the French.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> The attack on Hanoi was
ultimately a failure for French colonizers, costing <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-213">Garnier</a> his life. But the
cause of Catholicism was rewarded: the Treaty of 1874 that the French and
Vietnamese signed guaranteed, as Patrick Tuck notes, “virtually unfettered”
freedom of religion.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> A decade later, when Prime Minister <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-206">Jules Ferry</a> ordered
troops to invade Tonkin, France gained a protectorate, but with a
price. French troops suffered humiliation—<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-210">Henri de Rivière</a>, who led the
French assault, was captured and beheaded—and the move threatened war
with China, which remained uneasy about having a European colony along
its southern border. Although Tonkin became a protectorate, the French military’s
less-than-stellar performance cost Ferry his job. 
</p>

<p>
The religious violence that accompanied the invasion of Tonkin resulted
in the death of between 30,000 and 40,000 Vietnamese Christians and brought
to light the role of Catholic missionaries in a new republican empire. While
missionary publications reported the events in almost exclusively spiritual
terms, focusing heavily on the glories of martyrdom, the general question of
the political impact of missionary work in the empire became a salient issue
for a variety of commentators in the French press. French newspapers addressed
the killing of Christians and their missionaries with outrage and
horror, but a political agenda shaped the analysis. Clerics wrote editorials to
garner political and financial support from both the French government and
local congregations. For other commentators, be they supporters or critics of
missionary work, the issue showed the extent to which international affairs 
could be colored by domestic religious politics and the civilizing rhetoric of
French imperialism.
</p>

<p>
Many on the Catholic right—generally <i>not</i> friends of colonial expansion in
the 1880s—used the violence in Asia to paint republican policymakers as
cold and even murderous for ignoring the missions’ plight. In 1885, one expert
on the Far East, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Frédéric Romanet du Caillaud</a>, wrote that, by remaining
indifferent to the anti-Christian violence, the republic was carrying on a dangerously
anticlerical tradition that stretched from “the horrors of ’93” (when
many members of the French clergy were killed in the Terror) to the Paris
Commune.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> An article in the <i>Semaine Religieuse</i> claimed that the deaths of
the “true Christians” of Vietnam laid bare the Jewish and Masonic roots of
the republic. “Ah! If it had only concerned some Jewish groups, expelled ...
by populations tired of their monstrous usury,” the article ranted, “what
cries of indignation, what violent reclamations, in the name of humanity and
civilization, would have been heard from all sides!” But unfortunately, complained
the <i>Semaine Religieuse</i>, the <i>libre-penseurs</i> and Freemasons of the republican
camp seemed unmoved by the blood of 30,000 Asian Christians.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>
</p> 

<p>
In addition to their critiques of republicanism, both editorials emphasized
that Catholic converts were, to use <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Romanet du Caillaud’s</a> words, “naturalized
Frenchmen” sympathetic to the colonial cause. For the <i>Semaine Religieuse</i>,
the deaths of the Vietnamese were “an irreparable loss” for France.
Other writers concurred. In his newspaper <i>Liberte</i>, the notorious anti-Semite
and reactionary <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-214">Édouard Drumont</a> hailed missionaries’ role in spreading
French influence. Missionaries “who seem to work only for God,” he wrote,
“have been the most marvelous instrument of civilization, incomparable
workers for French power overseas.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> In neglecting the missionaries and
their civilizing influence, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-214">Drumont</a> surmised, republicans showed they were
not committed to making France a country of greatness. “If we want France
to retake its rank among peoples,” he wrote, “we must return to French tradition
and not persecute the religion that made France what it was, that is to
say, the premier nation in the world.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>
</p>

<p>
Missionaries, all these articles agreed, pushed wide the boundaries of
empire. For a writer in the <i>Avenir Militaire</i>, missionaries represented important
footholds in regions of the world hostile to European intervention. Missionaries,
the paper insisted, provided a shared religion and a superior
education that “destroyed in these converts [their] hatred of foreigners.”
The author continued, “what was drowned in blood” in the violence in Indochina
“was a political force favorable to Europe.” With the loss of the
Christians came the loss of France’s only friends. “Their blood has spilled,”
the article concluded, “not only for God, but for France; their death is a defeat
and a threat to us.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a>
</p>

<p>
Just as supporters of the missions argued that evangelization spread
French power by “naturalizing” converts, critics believed that religious work
inevitably led to violence. In 1886, for example, a number of articles in
Indochinese newspapers debated whether missionaries laid or destroyed
French inroads in China. The issue had particular relevance to readers in
colonial centers where Frenchmen were asking the same questions of local
missionaries. A serialized article in <i>L’Avenir du Tonkin</i>, a paper sold in
Hanoi and Haiphong, was clear in its criticisms of the danger of missionary
“zeal”—a state of mind that stood at odds with the rationalism required
for international politics.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> The article, written by Jean Bessières,
insisted that anti-Christian violence in China was not a by-product of Chinese
intolerance but rather retribution for missionary meddling. Horrified
that missionaries saw martyrdom as felicitous for the Catholic effort,
Bessières condemned Catholics for using the threat of French military
reprisals to manipulate Chinese governors. One instance of missionary
scheming, he claimed, led to a military skirmish that cost twenty-seven
French soldiers their lives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> For Bessières, missionaries were all guilty of “inopportune
intervention” into affairs that did not concern them; “their ambitions,
holy or profane, their imprudence, their excess of zeal” were all
sources of continual French embarrassment.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a>
</p>

<p>
Other articles supported Bessières’s conclusions. The <i>Courrier d’Haiphong</i>
seriously scrutinized whether France’s protectorate over the Catholic missions
of China had brought any good.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> In a 
piece in <i>L’ Avenir du Tonkin</i>, a former
French consul in China named Eugène Simon stated plainly that
missionaries were responsible for the most serious conflicts between the two
countries.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Under such circumstances, France could not achieve its political
and civilizing aims. In Vietnam, French readers of these articles on China’s
missions could not help but have questioned the intentions of the missionaries
in their midst. There, much of the discussion of Catholics avoided inflated
talk of civilization and French greatness, focusing instead on the far
more practical concerns of security and allegiance—not surprising, since,
throughout the 1880s, piracy and rebellion remained a part of daily life.
</p> 

<h2>Bishops, Officials, and the Uncertain<br>
History of Missionary Commitment</h2>

<p>
Officials in Indochina had good reason to want to believe that Catholic missionaries
and converts were sympathetic to their plans. In 1884, when France
added a protectorate over Annam and Tonkin to its possessions in
Cochinchina and Cambodia, not only had French Catholic missionaries been
in place for two centuries, but they also influenced considerable numbers
of Christian villages. In its estimates that year, the Société des missions
étrangères de Paris, the missionary organization in the region, counted more
than 350,000 Catholics in Indochina, the vast majority in Vietnam. In addition
to souls, the missions had an extensive physical and administrative infrastructure,
including six apostolic vicars, more than 150 French missionaries,
and 225 indigenous priests who could preach in more than 700 churches or
chapels. To prepare future generations, they ran nine seminaries and more
than 600 schools and orphanages that taught well over 10,000 students.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a>
With the exception of the Philippines, French Indochina was the most Christian
region in Southeast Asia.
</p>

<p>
Few things could please French officials more than to think that hundreds
of thousands of indigenous Christians were their friends. In 1880s and 1890s
Annam and Tonkin, where most administrative duties remained in the
hands of indigenous elites, French officials avoided involvement in religious
troubles, playing the part of mediator only when conflicts became particularly
heated. The administration took an official stance of religious neutrality
from the beginning of the protectorate. In 1886, responding to requests made
by Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles de Freycinet (a Protestant, missionaries
liked to point out), the colonial administration voted a new subsidy of
10,000 piastres for the missions to help spread “French influence.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> The 
government
also paid varying subventions to the missions to teach the French
language and to run schools, orphanages, and other facilities.
</p>

<p>
Despite the policy of neutrality and the paying of subventions, official
reservations about missionaries still loomed. Even de Freycinet’s call to subsidize
the missions’ efforts to spread “influence” met with some consternation
in the colony. But officials in Paris easily swayed the doubters, who
ultimately agreed that it would be “impolitic” to alienate Catholic communities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>
The administration refused to arm Christians, as many missionaries
had asked. But it turned a blind eye to independent Catholic militias
organized to combat mandarins whom missionaries deemed aggressive or
corrupt.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a>
</p>

<p>
Catholic bishops were no less ambivalent about their new partnership.
Stationed in the main cities of the region—Hanoi, Saigon, Hue, Phnom
Penh—bishops represented the missions in all official business and, for that
reason, had far more regular interaction with the administration than did
missionaries in the field. When troubles arose between missionaries and
local officials, mandarins, or colonists, it was the local bishop who went to
the administration to help smooth over the problems.
</p> 

<p>
From very early on, some bishops showed themselves eager to prove
their commitment to help France catch pirates, stave off rebellion, and
avoid war. The nineteenth century had been a tumultuous one for the Missions
étrangères in Indochina: from the 1830s, every decade brought stories
of missionary persecution and death. Mission leaders hoped that a
French colonial presence—provided it was partial to the missionary
endeavour—would bring a level of social and political stability that could
serve evangelizing. Colonialism could help conversion in less tangible
ways, as well. As Frenchmen, missionaries could tell their followers—with
much truth—that they enjoyed close relations with the new power. The
French administration, if it acted in ways that complemented missionary
goals and that benefited Christian communities, could enhance the missions’
prowess in the countryside.
</p> 

<p>
Bishops’ communications with administrators therefore showed their eagerness
both to assist colonization and to guide officials to act in the missions’
best interests. From the mid-1880s, for example, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215"><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Mgr. Puginier</a></a> sent
regular reports—sometimes more than one per week—to the residents-general
of Annam and Tonkin. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier’s</a> correspondence was rich with colorful
details: talk of “secret enemies” with “perverse designs” to forment
“internal revolts” was not out of the ordinary.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> In one report from 1888, for
example, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> warned that Chinese troops were waiting at the northern
border of Tonkin for the perfect moment to invade, while pirates within the
protectorate were swaying villagers to be “hostile to the French cause.”
“Careful! It is time to take precautions,” he warned. The colonial government,
his letters seemed to say, was in grave danger.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>
</p> 

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Mgr. Puginier’s</a> apparently primary allegiance to France allowed him to
influence the government to help the cause of evangelization. For example,
in 1888, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> suggested two steps that the administration could take to
avoid social unrest: it could ban census taking and put an end to the corvée,
the colonial system of requiring labor of the indigenous population. He
argued that both systems allowed local mandarin administrators to manipulate
and intimidate peasants. Some indigenous administrators in the countryside,
he wrote, would demand difficult physical labor of a starving
population and then blame the corvée on the colonial administration, effectively
turning the population against the French. Regardless of whether <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier’s</a>
recommendations were logical or sympathetic, they directly benefited
evangelizing. Missionaries’ chief adversaries in Tonkin were mandarins
who, Catholics complained, used census information to target Christian
communities for extortion and violence. Corvées were also a common point
of contention for missionaries who believed that the missions alone should
influence, and in some cases dictate, converts’ work habits. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> argued
that limiting the reach of indigenous administrators would help win over
a population already suffering from famine. He most certainly also hoped
it would further empower Catholics and free the missions from mandarin
interference.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Mgr. Puginier</a> was a more adept politician than his fellow bishops. Some
bishops could not accept easily the potential benefits of colonization, choosing
instead to harp on the hardships it caused for the missionary and his
followers. Especially contentious issues were taxation and justice. Taxes required
a poor population to work harder, meaning that, as one bishop put it,
the Christian “has neither the time, nor the leisure of studying prayers and
Christian doctrine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> In addition to concerns about prayer time, the mandarin
intermediaries who collected taxes undermined missionaries’ political
sway in their communities, often pitting the mission against local administrators.
A heavy tax burden, combined with corvée, also limited the amount
of work the missions could demand of their converts—a serious concern,
since Christian labor helped missions function.
</p>

<p>
The law commonly stirred controversy as well. Missionaries in Indochina
regularly became embroiled in questions of justice when Christians were involved.
In less divisive cases, the colonial government allowed missionaries
to help settle local disputes. But officials often found priests overstepping
their bounds and threatening domestic order. Serious altercations led to official
reproach of missionary behavior. In 1891, for example, a group of missionaries
in Cambodia overruled indigenous judicial officials, or <i>balat</i>, in
order to impose punishments for crimes ranging from tax evasion to murder.
According to the resident-superior of Cambodia, missionaries had “a very
marked tendency to assume power that they do not have.” Calling Christian
villages “veritable independent states,” he complained that missionaries intervened
“almost daily and always with impunity.” Even in a case of murder,
one local priest took it upon himself to pass sentence, excluding the local
judge and failing to notify French officials a few miles away in Phnom
Penh.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> According to one indigenous observer, the missionary’s “French nationality”
and “intelligence” gave him “great prestige before the people and
the mandarins, the latter of whom are not permitted to intervene in an affair
in which the <i>Père</i> will be involved.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> Such influence, in the minds of many
French officials, could either buttress their rule or undermine order and lead
to ethnic conflict, as the vast majority of Christians in Cambodia were ethnic
Vietnamese.
</p>

<p>
Missionary intervention in local politics regularly drew in—and was mediated
by—men at the highest level of government. In 1889, conflict between
Christians and non-Christians in the troubled province of Nghệ An threatened,
as the resident-superior of Annam noted, “to lead to the return of the
events of 1885.” Despite calls from the administration to back down, a number
of priests attempted to oust mandarin leaders and pursued charges
against a Vietnamese army officer. In a letter to the governor-general, the
resident-superior argued that the protectorate “must, without hesitation, remind
the mission of the truth of their role to stop their encroachment in the
domain of administrative authority.” But, in the end, the government’s response
lost much of the resident-general’s initial ire. Rather than reprimand
the priest directly, the resident-general advised the regional bishop to respect
the established chain of administration; the existing system, he said,
was the best way to ensure tranquillity for the mission and the region.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to disagreements over policies, there was the problem of compatibility:
many missionaries and republican officials just did not like one another.
In one 1890 report, the bishop of West Cochinchina wondered why it
seemed increasingly difficult to convert the local population. He attributed
the mission’s difficulties to the growing influence of French officials and
colonists in the region. In his words, there was a perceptible “feeling of incredulity
that penetrates the <i>indigènes</i> with knowledge of the French.” 
“Everywhere,” he continued, there was “hate and contempt ... for our compatriots.”
The bishop clearly sympathized with these emotions, seeing his
compatriots as an unimpressive bunch. “<i>Och!</i>” he lamented. “If France had
only sent honest and Christian men to Indochina!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> But in his correspondence
with the administration, the bishop dutifully held his tongue, trying
to make the best of what was quickly becoming an inevitable fate. While the
partnership between bishops and officials had become far more intimate and
complex than in the days of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Pigneau de Béhaine’s</a> visit to Versailles, the ambiguities
of their relationship were very slow to fade.
</p>

<h2>The View from the Field</h2>

<p>
While bishops and high-ranking officials in Hanoi, Saigon, and other major
colonial towns strove to keep relations amicable, missionaries in the countryside
were often more hostile to colonialism. From the mid-1880s forward, the
arrival of new local administrators armed with regulations forced missionaries
to come to terms with a new predicament. Bishops ran into officials with
great regularity at meetings, at social events, or even on the street. Missionaries
in the countryside, on the other hand, saw their new <i>chefs</i> with far less
frequency and often actively avoided interacting with them. This lack of
regular interaction likely did more to breed suspicion than to minimize misunderstandings
and gave rise to a climate of accusation, denial, and counteraccusation.
Despite bishops’ assurances that all missionaries spread a love of
France, many local administrators remained doubtful.
</p>

<p>
A look at missionary attitudes in one remote Catholic outpost suggests
that officials had good reason to be dubious. In the late 1880s and early 1890s,
there was no more controversial mission in the region than the one in the
highlands of central Vietnam. Its headquarters was at Kontum, a village that
was an arduous 200-kilometer trek from the coastal town of Qui Nhon, capital
of Binh Dinh province. If Frenchmen knew much of the plateau of the
central highlands, they knew of its reputation for dismal weather, dense
forests, fever, tigers, and unwelcoming inhabitants. The people who lived in
the region, such as the Sedang, the Bahnar, and the Jarai, were both ethnically
distinct from the majority Vietnamese population and fiercely autonomous,
causing many Frenchmen to invoke the derogatory Vietnamese
term <i>moï</i> or savage, to describe them. Catholic missionaries were the only
Europeans who had any prolonged experience in the “Pays moï,” having
had an established mission there since 1852.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> They faced a life of physical
hardship and sometimes violent confrontation that led them to call their
Kontum headquarters—with great pride—the “Mission des sauvages.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Jean-Baptiste Guerlach</a>, a missionary who spent most of his apostolic
career in the central highlands, left a vivid picture of how missionaries functioned
in societies where Europeans rarely ventured, much less settled.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a>
Like most missionaries, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> imagined his vocation as a continuation of
the work of Saint Paul, Francis Xavier, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-209">Alexandre de Rhodes</a>. He often
worked alone, guided by the long-established methods of his trade. In his
correspondence, the priest described how he lived within the norms and traditions
of the local population. He became fluent in local languages and
wrote detailed ethnographic studies of the highland minorities. He was a
teacher, doctor, and moral tutor for dozens of Christians. He also immersed
himself in local politics for the sake of the mission, working hard to make alliances
with local groups.
</p>

<p> 
In the spring of 1887, for example, conflicts with the Sedang, longtime
rivals of his Bahnar converts, made an attack on the Bahnar mission likely.
Before war broke out, the missionary mediated an accord between the
groups. In addition to minimizing the chances of future bloodshed, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
hoped that contact with the Sedang would bring them under the influence of
the mission and the One True God. To accomplish this, the missionary chose
a man named Bat to help him arrange a meeting with the Sedang chiefs. Bat
informed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> that it would be necessary to make a blood pact with the
chiefs to guarantee an indissoluble union. “That disgusted me a little,” <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
admitted, “but force made me submit to necessity.” The blood pact
would make the two chiefs, as the missionary understood it, his sons. On the
appointed night, a group of Sedang arrived in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> village, which was
appropriately decked out “<i>à la mode</i> Bahnar.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> Through the night the two
groups drank wine to the beat of drums; they slaughtered and feasted on a
buffalo, reminding <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> of scenes from <i>The Iliad</i>. The missionary presented
his new sons— “one of whom,” he quipped, “could certainly have
been my grandfather” —gifts of drums, bells, cotton, and pearls. Bat made a
short speech saying that the two groups were now one village and one family,
with one father—<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a>
</p>

<p>
The next morning, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> set up an altar with a large crucifix surrounded
by burning candles and a statuette of the Holy Virgin. As musicians
played their gongs and drums, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> stood between the two Sedang
chiefs, while each of them placed a hand on the crucifix. “Oh God,” the
priest pronounced, “I make today an alliance of father and son with Peu and
Léo of Kon Run.” The priest asked Jesus Christ to “reward my sons if they
are good and judge them according to your severe justice if they dare to
break their promises.” Then the three men—two Sedang chiefs and one
French priest—cut their thumbs and dripped blood into a cup of wine,
which Bat stirred with a chicken bone. Closing his eyes, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> took a sip
of the blood and wine, and his two “sons” finished it off. The cup was then
refilled with wine so everyone present could drink from it.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>
</p> 

<p>
The differences between this scene and official European diplomacy are
obvious; it is hard to imagine colonial officials agreeing to drink bloody wine
stirred with a chicken bone. But <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> was a missionary who typically accepted
“as much as possible” the practices of the local culture. His mingling
of local practices, Christian prayer, and a masslike ritual were in the tradition
of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-209">Alexandre de Rhodes</a> and other early missionaries who molded Christianity
as need dictated. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> later claimed that he had brokered the alliance
for the benefit of French influence, an idea he certainly believed insofar as he
thought Catholicism was a core French tradition. But in form and function
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> approach could not have differed more from the republican style
of colonialism. His goal was not to bring the Sedang under French rule but to
lead them, as he put it, “to quit the devil in order to give themselves over to
the good Lord.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> Even the justice that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> promised to deliver was not
the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-202">Third Republic</a>’s but rather that of Jesus. With the strange communion
complete, the reach of Catholicism’s influence now extended to a new highland
ethnic group.
</p>

<p>
Not only did <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> fail to see his work tied to French rule, he was
openly hostile about many of his lay compatriots. Despite his isolation, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a>
work in the highlands often stirred his resentment for the immorality
of contemporary French society. The story of Pierre, a young highland neophyte,
was one such case. Ignoring <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> admonitions, one day, while
working in the hot sun, Pierre drank some wine, sending him down a long
and unfortunate path. Over the previous few months, Pierre had been able to
rebuff the unwanted advances of a local pagan girl. Tipsy, however, Pierre
was doomed. “My unfortunate young man,” wrote <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>, “‘<i>let one thing
lead to another,</i>’ as one vulgarly says, and he succumbed.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> When the wine
vapors cleared, Pierre realized his mistake, wept, and swore never to drink
again. Rather than a story of moral weakness, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> held up Pierre as a
model for decadent French society. “How Europeans don’t have this delicacy
of conscience,” the missionary complained. He decried the French attitude
that said, “one peccadillo more or less, what’s that? Youth must have a good
time!” By contrast, the punishment for adultery in Pierre’s society was harsh:
the guilty paid a penalty of one buffalo to the village. Had the adultery resulted
in “complications,” <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> added, the two would have been enslaved
or forced to pay five to nine buffalos. “Try then to pass this law in the
Senate or in the chamber of deputies,” <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> wrote. “Civilization is a
beautiful thing; but how many of the civilized have a more obliterated moral
sense than [that of] the Savages!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a>
</p>

<p>
Time and again, when <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> thought of France he became convinced
that “a good number of savages will have a higher place in heaven than
many Frenchmen.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> If the republic had fallen into a general state of moral
degeneracy, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> considered its radical politicians to be the true
savages—an observation that lent a racial dimension to his criticisms. For example,
the missionary turned a discussion of Sedang sorcery into political
commentary about Freemasonry. While he believed that the devil intervened
in sorcerers’ work, the priest found Freemasonry to be even more demonic.
“Our unfortunate savages,” he wrote of his neophytes, indulged in “diabolical
practices, but they are a thousand times less criminal than the Occultist
Masons” who committed “the most ignoble blasphemies and the most horrible
profanations.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>
</p>

<p>
By attacking Freemasons, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> made reference to a prevalent political
issue in the colonies, where many of the most vocal proponents of expansion
(and the most outspoken anticlericals) were Freemasons. Under the influence
of Freemasonry, French colonial rule endangered all that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> worked
for—Christianity in Vietnam. He had particular scorn for Governor-General
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-211">Jean de Lanessan</a>, a Freemason and critic of Catholic proselytizing. As
governor-general, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-211">de Lanessan</a> followed Paris’s policy of religious neutrality.
But <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> found the governor-general’s anticlericalism obvious. He criticized
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-211">de Lanessan</a> for letting mandarins’ “hatred of the Christian religion”
go unbridled. Like a modern-day Pontius Pilate, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-211">de Lanessan</a> had “abandoned
the Christian princes to the hatred of their persecutors” and had furnished
the rod with which the mandarins beat the Christians.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> Far from
championing the arrival of French colonialism, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> was deeply concerned
about its potential destructiveness. Thousands of miles away in
France, supporters of the republican empire were blowing the trumpet of
civilization. From where this missionary stood, it was unclear which savages
needed civilizing—the inhabitants of the Pays moï or their supposed republican
saviors.
</p>

<h2>Beyond the Pale No Longer</h2>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> antagonism toward many of his countrymen makes clear that he
would have preferred to remain beyond the legislative reach of the administration,
a lone evangelist in his beloved Mission des sauvages. But soon after
France declared its protectorate over Annam, the central highlands aroused
serious official concern. The mid-1880s witnessed a number of events that
led to French unease about the security of Annam’s western border in the
central highlands. Under the guidance of mandarins, thousands of peasants
revolted with widespread violence aimed at overthrowing French rule. In
his history of Vietnamese anticolonialism, David Marr marks 5 July 1885—
the day <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-203">Ham Nghi</a>, the sitting emperor of Vietnam, fled his capital—as “a
turning point in the history of Vietnam’s response to foreign intervention.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>
The day signaled the real start of the Can vuong movement of widespread,
violent resistance to French rule. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-204">General de Courcy</a>, who led the
French forces, believed he lacked the troops to defeat the rebellion and restore
order. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-203">Ham Nghi</a> remained in hiding in the mountains of northern
Annam, seeking assistance from Muong minority villagers. French officials
feared he might stir up further rebellion until his capture in November
1888.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a>
</p>

<p>
The central highlands witnessed episodic violence, though not on the
scale of regions to the north and south (which made martyrs of missionaries
that led to debates in the French press). In central Annam, French administrators
relied on collaborating mandarins to help put down local
scholar-gentry rebellions. The relative security in this region, however, was
undermined by international politics when Siam increased its influence over
territory east of the Mekong River. French officials believed the British to be
behind Siam’s encroachment. Suspicion grew even deeper in 1886 when the
British moved into Upper Burma. Uncertain of their power over the Vietnamese
population and worried by menacing neighbors, Frenchmen in Indochina
saw their rule threatened from all sides.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> By the late 1880s, the
central highlands had ceased to be a terra incognita; instead, many officials
now saw the region as a vulnerable frontier where the Siamese, British, or
even—as some rumors suggested—Germans could stage an invasion of the
French protectorate. The French were thoroughly unprepared to battle both
foreign invaders and Can vuong resistance fighters.
</p>

<p>
Though nominally part of the French protectorate of Annam, the central
highlands remained politically autonomous. Local and regional mandarins
were entirely absent from the region, with Vietnamese authority not stretching
beyond An Khe, a town less than halfway to Kontum from Qui Nhon on
the coast. Traditionally, highland minorities had fiercely defended their independence
from the Vietnamese, occasionally fighting with and even enslaving
Vietnamese who entered their territory. The French had little interest in
challenging these groups’ claims of independence. The Catholic mission was
a powerful force in these communities, and the administration happily accepted
it as a sufficient representative of French influence. But against this
backdrop of instability, the essentially unchallenged independence of the
mission was to come under scrutiny.
</p>

<p> 
In 1888, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Charles-David de Meyréna</a>, a ne’er-do-well adventurer and explorer,
arrived in the central highlands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> Claiming to be on an official mission
for France, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> enlisted the help of two local 
missionaries, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> and one of his coreligionists, 
Père Irigoyen. Using the missionaries
as guides and translators, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> spent more than two months meeting
with local chiefs, making agreements defining villages’ relations to French
authority, and regulating trade between the region and the rest of the colony.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a>
But in June 1888, during a bout of severe fever, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> started making modifications
to the agreements already in place.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> In a constitution signed on 3
June at the Sedang village of Kon-Gung, in a region the French considered
most vulnerable to foreign attack, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> proclaimed himself king of the
Sedangs.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a>
</p>

<p>
The new “king,” who assumed the throne as Marie I, had a brief but notorious
reign. Though he had no aristocratic blood in his veins—“de Mayréna”
was an affectation—he was a master of royal pretensions and grandiose gestures.
Marie I ordered royal stationery, flags, medals of honor, postage
stamps, and even European-style military uniforms for his Sedang soldiers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a>
To the embarrassment of some and the amusement of many, the king granted
interviews to European journalists and wrote confident letters to heads of
state, including the president of the French republic. He spoke flamboyantly
of his commitment to defending <i>his</i> people despite not being able to speak
his people’s language. Stories of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> adventures circulated in cafés
from the rue Catinat in Saigon to the boulevards of Paris, and filled columns
of national and colonial papers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> His kingdom was a European fantasy that
only imperialism could have made real.
</p> 

<p>
Not all, however, was harmless showmanship. Out of cash, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>
threatened to turn to Britain, Siam, or even Germany—this from a man
awarded the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his part in the Franco-Prussian
War—if the French failed to recognize and invest in his Sedang
kingdom. Concerned that the highlands could fall under the influence of
their adversaries, colonial officials monitored <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> movements carefully
and treated him as a serious threat. The government spurned his requests
to meet with officials, including the president of the republic, and
waited for his options to run out. Broke, he soon left his kingdom for Hong
Kong and Europe in search of investors in his new country. In November
1890, on the island of Tioman off the Malaysian peninsula, while plotting his
surreptitious return to the highlands, the king of the Sedang died, allegedly
from a snakebite, though other theories, including suicide, abounded.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>
“I believe he was at the end of his resources,” wrote the French consulate in
Singapore. “This adventure is therefore finally finished.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a>
</p>

<p>
For the Catholic mission, however, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair had just begun.
From the moment they heard of his coronation, French officials began asking
how <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> came to power in the first place. Quick to acquit themselves of
wrongdoing, a number of administrators who had dealt with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> denied
ever having officially sponsored his expedition. Suspicions shifted to
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> and Irigoyen. For the Catholic missions in Indochina, it was the
first time their commitment to colonization came into serious question.
The entire mission—from the missionaries who had assisted the king of the
Sedangs to regional bishops—became embroiled in what grew into a very
public affair.
</p>

<h2>Sorting Out Facts, Assigning Blame</h2>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> may have been, in the words of one biographer, nothing more than
a “mediocre adventurer, a swindler, and worse still, nearly a traitor,” but he
was also an adept opportunist.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[57]</a> Playing on anxieties about <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-203">Ham Nghi’s</a> flight
to the highlands, and despite being a suspected criminal without money or
connections, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> ultimately won the support of the administration for
an expedition to look ostensibly for gold in the area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[58]</a> Most officials who met
him had reservations—even grave doubts—though time and again they assisted
him.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> The lieutenant governor of Cochinchina believed that an expedition
like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> could be beneficial for “developing French influence in
this region” on the condition that it be entrusted to a man “of irreproachable
morals and perfect honesty.” He was skeptical that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> was such a
man.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> But in the early spring of 1888, the administration deemed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>
good enough, and gave him permission to go, though without the status of
an official expedition. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> also impressed, if deceptively, Mgr. Van Camelbeke, the bishop
in Qui Nhon. Believing that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> was on an official mission, the bishop
contacted his priests in Kontum and appealed to (as he later put it) their “patriotism”
to facilitate the explorer’s project.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> The assistance proved essential.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> entourage included a European associate, two Vietnamese concubines,
a cook, four Chinese merchants to help locate gold deposits, an interpreter,
eighteen <i>miliciens</i>, and eighty coolie porters, and by the time it arrived 
in the highlands, it was in trouble.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> Many of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> porters had abandoned
him because of brutal treatment and work left unpaid.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> He immediately
sent a message to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> requesting elephants and Christian porters.
Upon the missionary’s arrival, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> had signed two treaties of friendship
with local chiefs, including a particularly influential chief named Pim.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> seemed to be establishing what officials called “amicable alliances
between tribes,” something both missionaries and French administrators
had championed for some time.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> With letters of introduction from officials
and the bishop, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> seemed completely legitimate.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a>
</p>

<p>
For much of the following three months, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> traveled and lived side
by side with the missionaries of Kontum, particularly <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a>. In addition
to acting as interpreter, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> transcribed and translated the agreements
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> signed with local chiefs.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> In 
his reports to officials, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>
repeatedly spoke of the influence the missionaries held over the local population,
stating that their involvement would be essential in any further negotiation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a>
At the same time, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> later reported, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> increasingly
spoke of his royal aspirations, assuring the missionary all along that the government
had condoned his plans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a>
</p>

<p>
What exactly happened in the weeks after <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> named himself king
remains, as <i>Le Temps</i> put it at the time, “a little obscure.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> Later 
accounts by
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>, and others were colored by the accusations and defenses
of the ensuing affair. Two facts caused great embarrassment and called into
question the missionaries’ actions. On 1 July 1888, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> revised the constitution
of the Sedang kingdom to make Catholicism the official religion.
It was but one of many articles in the document, but it raised officials’ eyebrows.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a>
And cementing the impression that the mission had conspired with
the king of the Sedangs, on nearly every treaty <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> signed were the signatures
of the missionaries who acted as translators and witnesses. In addition
to such cold facts, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> flamboyant praise of his missionary
assistants by no means helped the Catholic cause. He assured the administration
that the mission was the only real force in the region. “Who furnished
the maps that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has?” <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> asked in one
letter. Answer: “The Missions. Who today can say where Annam begins and
ends? The Missions.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> In the same vein, a thought must have struck many
French officials: Who must have helped <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>, a potential traitor, become
the king of the Sedangs?
</p>

<p>
Resident Charles Lemire, the ranking French official in Qui Nhon, was the
first to finger missionary culpability. Lemire was a classic colonial type, part
bureaucrat who bounced from one imperial post to another, and part explorer,
traveler, art collector, and guidebook writer.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> He had initially shown
excitement for <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> project, asking the explorer to collect flora, fauna,
and minerals for the Exposition de Paris, and to keep logs describing the expedition’s
travels, the daily weather, and other information to be presented
to the Congrès géographique the following year.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> After the king’s ascension
to the Sedang throne, however, Lemire was eager to shed his erstwhile enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
In November 1888, Lemire blamed the mission of the central highlands for
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> successes and questioned missionary allegiance to France. In his
opinion, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> and Irigoyen had actively supported <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> royal designs
in the hope of establishing an independent Catholic kingdom like the
Jesuits of seventeenth-century Paraguay—a stock criticism leveled by anticlerical
republicans in the fin de siècle.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> Lemire offered evidence of the mission’s
intentions: he reported that <i>after</i> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> had returned from the
highlands as Marie I, priests in Qui Nhon had honored the renegade with a
special prie-dieu, a private prayer desk, fitted with red drapery and a special
cushion. Surrounded by such finery, the resident added, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> had been
the guest of honor at a mass given by none other than Père Irigoyen, the
translator of the Sedang constitution.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> In France, <i>Le Temps</i> printed Lemire’s
accusations that missionaries had blessed the newfound kingdom. The newspaper,
which took the entire affair lightheartedly, joked that, considering
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> desire to find investors in Europe for his new enterprise, Guerlach
might now bless dividends as well as the king’s flags.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a>
</p> 

<p>
The resident-superior of Annam and Tonkin, Paul Rheinart, was not
amused. He took Lemire’s claims seriously and oversaw an investigation of
the mission’s involvement in the affair. He demanded that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> and
Irigoyen be removed from their positions in the region—a request that drove
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> to travel to Hanoi to clear his name.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> And he asked Mgr. Van
Camelbeke in Qui Nhon to explain the mission’s position on French influence
in the highlands. When Van Camelbeke said that the region was largely
independent of colonial administrative influence, Rheinart strongly rebuked
him— “the political map of Indochina,” he snapped, “contains no ‘blanks’” —and
expressed concern that the mission “took the side” of a man who
planned to tum the region over to foreign domination.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> As the issue moved
up the administrative chain, however, the language describing the mission’s
actions became notably more circumscribed. Governor-General Richaud, in
a report to Paris, described the mission’s interaction with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> as “very
regrettable” and echoed Resident-Superior Rheinart’s concerns about the
mission’s allegiance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
</p>

<p>
Criticism of the mission was not restricted to the halls of government; the
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair, from the beginning, was also an <i>affaire de presse</i>. In late June
1888, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> turned over a copy of the 3 June constitution of the Sedang
kingdom to the <i>Courrier d’Haiphong</i>, one of the major newspapers in Tonkin.
News of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> royal ascension brought about a rich exchange of articles
reflecting an array of opinions about the king, the French administration, the
pays moï, and the Catholic mission. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> appreciated the power of public
opinion, and many of his subsequent articles were submitted in the hope
that “public opinion would provoke a solution.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a> A solution based on public
opinion, however, was just what the mission hoped to avoid.
</p>

<h2>The Mission Responds</h2>

<p>
To the accusations made against the missionaries of the central highlands,
the mission responded at all levels—from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> to regional bishops, from
private meetings to letters published in colonial newspapers. In conversations
and correspondence with the administration, Bishop Van Camelbeke
repeatedly denied the claim that the mission had knowingly collaborated
with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>. He dismissed as “pure fable” Lemire’s assertion that the
church had given a special mass in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> honor and outfitted a prie-dieu
for royal use. Lemire, in the bishop’s view, believed too many of the extravagant
things that came from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> mouth. Instead, the bishop assured officials
that he and his missionaries had spurned the king’s requests for
assistance. “We refused equally,” Van Camelbeke added, “to give him the denominations
of Sire, Majesty, King ... etc.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> The bishop’s denials were
padded with proclamations of patriotism. Avoiding passionate claims about
a love of country, he nonetheless reasserted what he called “the rectitude of
my feelings” regarding the <i>patrie</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to offering denials and patriotic promises, apostolic vicars described
the highland missionaries not as potential traitors but as assets of
colonial control. If the colony wanted to spread its influence in the highlands,
the missions argued, it did not need to fund adventurers like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>.
Rather, as Van Camelbeke wrote to the governor-general in late 1888, the
mission would do: “France can, when it wants, recognize its protectorate
over these savage tribes, since the missionaries displayed the French flag
well before M. de <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a> The 
regime’s biggest error of judgment, in
other words, was not relying more on missionaries in the first place.
</p>

<p>
No one made a more masterful case for missionary assistance than
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Mgr. Puginier</a>, whose vicariate did not include the central highlands. In some
“secret and private notes” shared with the governor-general, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> reflected
on the mistakes that officials had made in trusting the treasonous
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>. The public, he warned, would find it “strange” that the government
had not only allowed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> to become king but also failed to respond
quickly to the affair. People would “find it inexplicable that this man
guilty of committing a crime so grave” had, first, been received as a guest by
the resident of Qui Nhon and then been allowed to go to Hong Kong, where,
it was rumored, he had sought financial support from the British. With the
balanced tone of a seasoned adviser, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> suggested two ways of settling
the affair, thus saving the government further embarrassment. The first “less
noble” option was simply to pay <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> “in secret” 100,000 to 200,000
francs to give up his possession. A second, preferable option was to convince
the Sedangs to remove <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> from office. “I think,” the bishop added,
“that this could be done in secret and that the missionaries would be able effectively
to help obtain this goal.”
</p>

<p>
Acting as if officials had never accused the Kontum mission of wrongdoing, 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> encouraged the government to confer with the bishop at Qui Nhon to
find the best way to involve the mission in this “delicate” undertaking. He
wrote that the mountain populations would have to retain some autonomy
from the colony and that the missionaries in the highlands would be best able
to “give practical information” on how to foster relations with the “tribes” of
the highlands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier’s</a> advice was a brilliant bit of political maneuvering.
His analysis of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair turned the missionaries suspected of treason
into the most logical saviors of the government’s reputation. Even more
important to missionaries protective of their autonomy from administrative
meddling, it made a case for letting the minorities of the highlands—and the
mission of Kontum—remain outside the watchful eye of French authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach’s</a> defense followed a tack very similar to that of his superiors.
Bishops generally did not endorse missionary forays into public debate. 
In the case of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair, 
however, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> was allowed to defend
himself both in private meetings with officials and in print. In late 1888,
as the story became a sensation in the colonial press, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> penned
lengthy letters in rapid succession that appeared on the front page of the
<i>Courrier d’Haiphong</i>. The priest’s published accounts were studies in the arts
of evasion, denial, and excuse. “My signature,” he wrote, referring to
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> treaties and constitutions 
that he and Irigoyen had signed, “implies
no engagement or cooperation whatsoever.” He reassured a skeptical
public: “I signed as an eye-witness, that's all.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> became most
animated—and melodramatic—when defending his patriotism. Time and
again, he insisted that his work as a missionary “planted the French flag” in
faraway regions. And he showed himself to be deeply sensitive to accusations
that the mission was “hostile to our <i>patrie</i>” and to rumors that questioned
“the patriotism and honor of the missionaries.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a>
</p> 

<p>
Sensitive one minute, he lashed out the next. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> reserved his most
toxic venom for Charles Lemire, who, he claimed, should not have allowed a
man like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> to venture into the highlands in the 
first place.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> He denounced
Lemire as a poor judge of character for befriending <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>. “In
this circumstance, as in many others,” the missionary railed, “M. Lemire did
not prove the qualities necessary of a Resident.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a> By contrast, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
championed the resident-general who he believed had looked benevolently
on the mission. Perhaps aware that higher-ranking administrators were more
tolerant of the missions, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> waxed that the resident-general knew “that
the missionaries established among the savages love France with all their
hearts and are disposed to serve it with all their power. May M. le Résident-Général
receive here publicly evidence of my respectful devotion.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[90]</a>
</p>

<p>
Like Bishops Van Camelbeke and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> used the affair
to promote his mission. Had the administration given the Catholic mission
an official diplomatic and political role in the first place, he argued, French
rule would not be so unstable in the region. To support his case, he pointed
to a number of agreements he had made with highland villages that, he insisted,
benefited France. He told Resident-General Rheinart that he had been
involved in the creation of the Bahnar-Rongoa Confederation, a defensive
alliance of two major highland ethnic groups. While the confederation was
initially developed to defend the region against Vietnamese encroachment,
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> now argued that it had been ready to put itself under the protectorate
of France when <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> arrived and complicated matters. He
lamented that the mission— “the sole presence that had planted the French
flag” in the region—had no official authority and, therefore, could not help
build an alliance between the confederation and the French. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> encouraged
the administration to give the mission an official status so that Père
Vialleton, the superior in Kontum, could start negotiating with “the savage
Chiefs” who remained beyond French reach.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a> Like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> promoted
a plan that would have the administration rely on the mission, and
would have the mission remain independent.
</p> 

<h2>The Vagaries of French Patriotism</h2>

<p>
One of the things <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> loved most about his Mission des sauvages
was its remote and inhospitable location, where he enjoyed what he called
“the calm of the apostolic life.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a> But in the 
wake of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a>, his mission
was invisible no more. In the spring of 1889, Vice-Resident Guiomar in Qui
Nhon was dispatched to the central highlands to investigate the mission’s influence.
Like other administrators before him, Guiomar filed a report that focused
heavily on the question of missionary allegiance to France. Though he
acknowledged being more or less at the mercy of the missionaries during his
travels, Guiomar was skeptical throughout about the mission’s patriotism
and commitment to aiding colonization. He noted that he saw French flags
flying in every village he visited, but he remained uncertain whether these
were permanent displays or simply put up by Guerlach and his coreligionists
for the vice-resident’s benefit.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a>
</p>

<p>
Guiomar was struck by the tremendous power the mission at Kontum had
over both the Christian and non-Christian populations. Its influence was not
necessarily excessive, but the impression worried him. “The missionaries,”
he wrote, “consider the country they occupy as their property, and they
never voluntarily favor the settlement of any European whatsoever.” The realization
lent credence to Lemire’s accusations: in the vice-resident’s opinion,
the missionaries had found in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> a man who would act at their discretion,
“a docile instrument” who would help them in the creation of an independent
state, like that of the Jesuits of Paraguay. When it became apparent
that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> had ideas of his own, Guiomar determined, the mission turned
on him because “they preferred to abandon their projects before giving in to
a master.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a>
</p>

<p> 
In Guiomar’s estimation, patriotism had nothing to do with the missionaries’
behavior throughout the affair; he even refused to believe that the mission
ever thought <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> was an envoy of the French government. “In the
interest of their work,” Guiomar wrote of the missionaries, “and in order to
justify their conduct that followed, they said and repeated that their patriotic
sentiments had been abused.” Why were the missionaries so concerned
about their reputations, he wondered, “if their conduct had not been dubious?”
Guiomar questioned whether the mission would prove so patriotic in
the future as the administration strengthened its presence in the highlands
and used its authority to regulate the mission’s activities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[95]</a>
</p>

<p>
Vice-Resident Guiomar’s criticism struck at some basic truths about the
missionaries in the central highlands, and more generally about religious
workers in French Indochina. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach’s</a> claims that he blindly followed
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> in the belief he was helping an official envoy of France simplified
more complex motivations. In a private letter written <i>after</i> the affair, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
candidly recounted how <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> visit had benefited the mission in a number
of ways. Generally, by traveling with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> across the region, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
had “an occasion to explore foreign villages and to build with them
relations of good friendship” —thus laying the groundwork for future evangelizing.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a>
</p>

<p>
More specifically, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> offered a solution to what both Mgr. Van
Camelbeke and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a> called “the famous Jarai affair.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a> The Jarai
were particularly aggressive neighbors of the Bahnar and had long menaced
evangelizing efforts by attacking and pillaging Christian villages and convoys.
Upon his arrival, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> persuaded <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> to lead an expedition
of 1,400 Sedang and Bahnar warriors against the Jarai. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>, who went
along “as the chaplain,” boasted that the Jarai “received a severe lesson”;
they were made to pay a ransom equivalent to the goods they had stolen
from the Bahnar, he reported, and they knew not to bother the mission
again. The area secure, the priest said that the mission could now “more easily
extend and develop our work.” In this instance, the missionary admitted,
“the Mission des sauvages greatly prospered” from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> 
work.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a>
</p>

<p>
The fact that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> was eager to see <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna’s</a> military power benefit
the mission does not necessarily mean that he supported the adventurer’s
royal aspirations, however. Guiomar’s observation about the relative political
and social power the mission enjoyed over the population undermined his
allegation that it hoped to establish an independent Catholic state. With European
visitors a rarity in the highlands, missionaries were essentially independent
as it was—a belief Van Camelbeke betrayed to the administration.
Declaring the central highlands an independent Catholic state would have
attracted more official attention, not less, especially at a time when the administration
was intensely aware of security weaknesses. The mission had
nothing to gain by putting its faith in a feverish Frenchman.
</p> 

<p>
Officials had little time to study the nuances of missionary motivations
and appeared interested in answering only one question: Were missionaries
patriots or pariahs? Conflicts between missionaries and officials—be
they bishops and residents-general, or rural religious workers and local
administrators—forced missionaries to express their patriotism in a way that
ran counter to the spiritual traditions of their vocation. For some, like Bishop
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Puginier</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Père Guerlach</a>, declarations of love for France seem to have
come naturally and were likely heartfelt. Even so, missionary definitions of
patriotism were strikingly different from those of republicans. The republican
criticism that missionaries worked to spread the love of God, not French
influence, did little to clarify this difference: to missionaries, French influence
could only begin in a land that loved God.
</p> 

<p> 
In the early <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-202">Third Republic</a>, one Frenchman’s patriot could be another’s
pariah. No missionary better exemplified this phenomenon than <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>.
With a background more suitable to a prime minister than a priest, he was
born on Bastille Day in 1858 (a coincidence he might have lamented) in Metz,
Lorraine. In 1870, still a child, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> took to the battlefield to defend
French soil against the Prussian invasion.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a> After 
France’s defeat, he spent his
youth in what he called a <i>patrie mutilée</i>, resentful of the Prussians and praying
to “God the Protector” to “save France in the name of the <i>Sacré Coeur</i>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">[100]</a>
Throughout the nineteenth century, the Sacré Coeur was a powerful political
symbol of counterrevolutionary thought in France. The basilica in Montmartre
built for the Sacred Heart of Jesus set in stone many Catholics’ disdain
of French republicanism. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> undoubtedly loved France, though
not the France that Lemire and Guiomar served.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> decision to become a missionary was closely linked to his
Patriotism—but it was by no means a love of the republic. By living among
the “savages,” learning their languages and customs, and making treaties
with them, he believed he was fulfilling France’s duty to God. For <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a>
and many missionaries like him, evangelizing was in itself a patriotic act: the
separation of French influence and the mission’s influence was, in his mind,
not possible. A country evangelized by missionaries, France now had a duty
as the eldest daughter of the Church to evangelize abroad. Despite the rise of
the anticlerical republic, he wrote, “France still remains the soldier of God
and the kingdom of Mary. <i>Regnum Galliae, Regnum 
Mariae</i>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">[101]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> described
himself as a soldier in a “holy war” in the “Kingdom of God” who
fought the devil, paganism, and sin with the teachings of 
Christ.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[102]</a> In his
mind, nothing could better serve France, its traditions, or its influence in the
world than the triumph of Catholicism. Lemire, Guiomar, and many other
republicans in the empire could not have disagreed more.
</p> 

<h2>A Complicated Collaboration</h2>

<p>
While <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> counterrevolutionary patriotism would have perplexed and
appalled legions of secularist republicans in France, it sufficed to alleviate anxieties
in 1880s Indochina. As far as Resident-General Rheinart was concerned,
the declarations of patriotism made by Catholic missionaries in the wake of the
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> scandal cleared them of further suspicion. Considering the Quai
d’Orsay’s position to support French missionary work, Rheinart needed little
convincing. Writing to Van Camelbeke of his “esteem and sympathy for our
missions,” Rheinart commended what he called the “sentiments of ardent patriotism”
that missionaries had shown “many times in the face of danger.”
Even constricted by the stale genre of the official letter, the administrator’s correspondence
gushed with admiration, expressing his happiness “that nowhere
is more patriotism shown than in [the bishop’s] beautiful mission.” Van Camelbeke’s
“so loyal declarations,” he commended, had helped “destroy and annul”
all accusations made against the missionaries of the central 
highlands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[103]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rheinart lauded <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> as well. “I thank you infinitely for this new sign
of patriotism you have given us,” the resident-general wrote. “Believe that I
am very touched by it, and that I am very happy to have seen entirely disappear
the misunderstanding that had sprung up during the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> Affair.”
He also commended <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach</a> for his wise advice regarding the highland
confederations and for helping organize “the defense of the 
country.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[104]</a>
Rheinart demonstrated his approbation with administrative action. He instructed
Lemire, whose behavior he called “tactless,” to cease further investigation
of missionary wrongdoing.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">[105]</a> The 
following month, in January 1889,
Lemire was removed from his post and reassigned to Vinh. Lemire left office
convinced the mission was guilty of duplicity, saying that one missionary
had supported <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> at Qui 
Nhon while another repudiated the king of
the Sedang at Hanoi.
</p>

<p>
Though insightful and powerfully worded, Vice-Resident Guiomar’s report
on <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Guerlach’s</a> mission failed to change French policy toward the missions of
the central highlands or anywhere else in Indochina. Further investigation
determined that building a permanent administrative post in the region
would be too difficult and too costly. For the administration in both Indochina
and France, the missionaries were accepted as effective tools for
spreading French influence. During the years that followed, the Kontum
mission encountered only occasional travelers. In 1898, after years of informally
relying on his help, the French government named Père Vialleton, the
superior at Kontum, as the official representative of the protectorate in the
highlands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">[106]</a> The 
government congratulated the priest, who was once implicated
in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair, for using the mission’s influence to benefit the
administration. The protectorate had the representation it needed without
building expensive new posts. The highland mission had won the administration’s
trust to fulfill the political and diplomatic functions of the colony.
As a result, the region, its ethnic minorities, and its missionaries remained
outside the reach of republican administrative officials for the following
decade.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair reveals how Catholic missions across Indochina—and,
indeed, the empire—came to interact with the French administration in the
1880s, during the first ten years of republican colonial expansion. There was,
as many historians have suggested, a level of collaboration between missionaries
and republican officials. But this collaboration was far more complicated
than historians have suggested. The fiercely competing traditions,
goals, and political sensibilities of the two groups involved expose the problems
of seeing religious missionaries and republican colonizers as simple
partners. Despite the Quai d’Orsay’s policy to support French missionary efforts
and bar the exportation of anticlericalism to the empire, local colonial
officials often raised the thorny—and valid—question of whether missionaries
worked to spread French influence or purely to fulfill their apostolic
goals, even to the detriment of the empire. In extreme cases, such accusations
drove high-ranking administrators like Rheinart to investigate and motivated
bishops to reassure officials of the benefits the missions had to offer the
colony. Missionaries insisted that their work helped spread a love of France
among the indigenous population. In most instances, bishops and high-ranking
officials tried to smooth over conflicts between missionaries and local
administrators, but the deep enmity between the two was suppressed
only with difficulty. Far from being eager servants of empire in Indochina,
missionaries remained acutely suspicious of colonial authority. Even as they
made declarations of patriotism—proof, it would seem, of their commitment
to the colonial cause—they maneuvered to safeguard their autonomy and increase
the missions’ influence over local communities. For missionaries in
the 1880s, spreading French influence was still, at best, a fortunate by-product
of spreading Catholicism.

<p>
While missionaries may or may not have benefited French colonial
authority, they quickly learned that the Catholic cause could flourish under
the new regime. Despite some significant political bumps along the way—the
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Mayréna</a> affair being the most jarring—the arrival of republican colonial
rule witnessed a dramatic growth of evangelizing. A decade after the protectorate
of Annam and Tonkin had been added to France’s empire, the number
of Catholics in Indochina had increased by 60 percent to more than half a
million. The missionary ranks swelled, and mission schools, hospitals, and
orphanages expanded. Such services gave the administration more reason to
tolerate Catholic workers, and high-ranking officials became increasingly
defensive of the policy of religious neutrality in the colonies. They became
more adamant about keeping conflicts between local administrators and missionaries
to a minimum. But with the successes of the missions mounting
and the number of republican colonists expanding, the climate of conflict did
not calm. The 1890s and early 1900s witnessed a new anticlerical force
emerging in French Indochina: Freemasons. As French control of the countryside
became more assured, the question of French influence was no
longer at issue. For Freemasons, Catholic missionaries posed a much graver
threat—to civilization itself.
