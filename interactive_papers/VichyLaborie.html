But we are, I know not how, dual in ourselves, so that that which we believe,
we do not believe, and we cannot put out of our minds that which we condemn.<br>
<br>		
- Montaigne <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a><br>
<br>
Will the work of historians ever help the French sort out and judge, outside
the realm of passions, those times when they ‘did not love one another’?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
How thoroughly can we know and understand this France of the dark
years, entangled in the confusions of an identity crisis brought to a fever
pitch? To what extent can we understand the true meaning of collective
choices, when the confusion of a humiliated people affects the depth of
its consciousness and the very foundation of its notion of nation and
country?<br>
<br>
<b>Obsession and Deafness</b><br>
<br>
Time and generations go by, witnesses fade away, but fascination and
doubt remain, tightly intermingled. The ever-present and excessive glorification
of refusal is starting to quiet down, as if nothing could soothe the
scars of Vichy and the Occupation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> A portion of the present continues to
write itself in the past; but the opposite is also true, and this dialectic
increasingly gives structural depth to the syndrome analyzed by Henry
Rousso. By stirring up almost obsessively the memory of those four
interminable years, France keeps asking and repeating the same troubled
questions about itself over and over, while ignoring or pretending to
rediscover each time truths long ago established by scholars. The repeated
expressions of surprise, exploited and amplified by the media, show the
French to be stubbornly oblivious to the strangeness of their own deafness.
They endlessly repeat that it is time to lift the time-worn taboos, that it is
urgent to speak at last of those issues that are never spoken of. To be
sure, we are far from having said everything about Vichy, collaboration, <b>(p.182)</b> 
or the Resistance; we know even less about the various ways that French
society made it through this period. But one is entitled to wonder what
can be gained from the continual stutterings of a history/memory that is
constantly being adapted to suit the changing trends of the moment. What
remains of the civic dimension of reflecting on the past, when the whole
process is being manipulated and distorted in successive reconstructions,
when identity politics encroach on the logic of truth, when ideological
agendas result in anachronistic interpretations that show scant regard for
basic rules of method and concern for accuracy? Despite the professed
intentions of those who uphold such a methodology, its effectiveness is
open to question. It is not clear that these simplifications and reversals
of perspective are the best means of persuading the French to look at
their past without self-indulgence, and to look their entire history in the
face.<br>
<br>
The judgments passed on the collective attitudes and behaviors of the
period between 1940 and 1944 are characteristic of this mixture of respectable
intentions, fearfulness, and anxiety over all that is at stake in the
realm of memory. The extraordinary variety of personal experiences
passed on by friends and family, as well as the topic’s sensitivity and its
popularity—everyone has an opinion on the matter—limit the impact of
the dispassionate perspective of historians and their efforts to explain what
happened. When these efforts stray too far from that which is touchily
guarded as ‘memorially correct’ to a particular group or community, they
are poorly received, and sometimes even suspected of insidiously striving
to justify the unjustifiable. The troubling question of behaviors during
the Occupation is a recurring central theme in a debate that has been
more about pronouncing judgment than about dealing with the issues
and understanding their complexity.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> Such questions are deeply relevant
to our times because of their moral dimension, and yet too often they are
reduced to the level of excessive generalizations, simplistic alternatives,
or even summary judgments of the ‘all guilty, all collaborationists’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
variety. The question keeps coming up repeatedly, whether in relation to
the extermination of the Jews, the early career of a French President, the
trial of a senior civil servant, the paths followed by certain members of
the Resistance, or the zeal of the administration . . . Using solidly established
and over-rigid typologies—Pétainists, resisters, collaborationists,
fence-sitters [<i>attentistes</i>], criminals, accomplices, etc.—people want
to classify, categorize, and count. They also seek to blame or glorify,
denounce, demand justice and seek reparations. In contexts where needs
of the moment require the mental categories and cultural models of
the present to be applied to our understanding of the past (at the risk of <b>(p.183)</b> 
distorting its meaning), historians are nevertheless summoned for
validation. The result is a persistent misunderstanding, further complicated
by insistent injunctions as to the duties of memory, whose task is to carry
the past into the future.<br>
<br>
<b>Collective Behaviors and the Complexity of the Social Sphere</b><br>
<br>
The universality of the Holocaust’s teachings, along with the imprescriptibility
of crimes against humanity, have given a powerfully renewed
momentum to the complex dialectic of the relationship between memory
and history. The difficulties of the dialogue are not new; but they cannot
be allowed to lend credence to the notion that all explanatory methods
be considered by nature exonerating and relativistic. To pursue and
investigate more deeply the nature and meaning of French collective
reactions, which is the object of the hypotheses put forward in this chapter,
serves but one purpose: to recover ordinary ways of thinking and to
analyze their mechanisms in order better to understand the complexity
of the social sphere. It is within this perspective that this essay on double
think and the French people must be placed.<br>
<br>
Before proceeding further, three points need to be made for the sake
of clarification. The first states a fundamental fact: the social actors’ way
of being in the world constitutes an essential factor for understanding
their relationships to the events and problems of the time. Only by attempting
to recreate modes of reasoning and systems of mental representations
(and these are rarely directly accessible) can the historian hope to uncover
some of the essential mechanisms that inform behaviors. The second point
is an extension of the first, and deals with methodology: one must break
with that kind of political history that understands the movements of public
opinion in terms of rational and self-evident explanation, that analyzes
public opinion on the basis of its outward forms. The third point, though
obvious, must not be ignored: it is important to remember that collective
feeling is always expressed according to a scale of interests and a certain
order of priorities, these being unstable hierarchies that are created from
what individuals perceive, or think they perceive, of reality at a given
moment. As mundane as it may sound, one must agree with Etienne
Fouilloux that, immediately following the defeat, ‘taking sides was not
the major preoccupation’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> of a population that was distraught, tired, and
dogged by a lingering apathy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a><br>
<br>
<b>(p.184)</b><br>
<br>
<b>Ambivalence and Lost Cultural Codes</b><br>
<br>
How can we know what ordinary French people of the time perceived,
thought, and understood? How can we grasp how much they knew of
history, and understand how they were living it? How should we read and
experience, over half a century later, the words of 1940 or 1944, and how
can we uncover and reconstitute the interpretative frames through which
they were heard and understood? On 10 February 1941, Jean Guéhenno
wrote in his <i>Journal</i>: ‘What genius the historians of the future will need
in order to recognize the true causes and true motives behind the events
referred to in these texts, these communiques in which not a word is either
loyal or accurate!’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Once we sift out the portion of malice that lurks behind
these words, we can see that the ‘work of genius’ to which historians of
the future are called constitutes a kind of instruction manual. He foresees
with clarity the considerable difficulties historians will encounter in trying
to rediscover the collective sensibility of a disconcerting period, in seeking
to reconstruct the era, to grasp what might have been going on in people’s
minds, and in attempting to piece together what most French people’s
ordinary understandings of the present might have been.<br>
<br>
Despite the apparent proximity, the illusion that we might easily bridge
the modest gap in time, the mental logic and cultural codes of French
people in the 1940s have become largely foreign to us.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> We must nevertheless
investigate what their modes of operation may have been. This
research underscores, among other things, the major role of ambivalent
thoughts and feelings. So strong a presence and so much evidence inevitably
lead some to wonder.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> Before turning ambivalence into a major
concept for the analysis of public opinion, or into a structural element of
all forms of mass psychology, however, we need to determine whether
we are dealing with an inherent characteristic of the fundamental nature
of opinion, independent of environment and culture, or whether ambivalence
constitutes a feature specific to certain particular cultures. We lack
the elements of comparison that would allow for a credible answer. Should
the phenomenon point unwaveringly to a French singularity, the example
of the 1940s could reinforce certain stereotypes of a common Francophobia
that puts a heavy emphasis on a natural propensity for artful
maneuvering, for opportunism and subterfuge.<br>
<br>
<b>Ambivalence or Ambiguity</b><br>
<br>
Whether a national particularity or a widespread feature of the relationship
between occupying powers and occupied people, the considerable role <b>(p.185)</b> 
of ambivalence is a major characteristic of French attitudes under Vichy.
It is also one of the least-distorting mirrors for understanding the mutability
of wait-and-see situations and their apparent contradictions. The
simplistic alternatives of Pétainism and Gaullism, resistance and Vichyism,
or resistance and collaboration, can only provide highly reductionistic
images of what people went through at the time. We know, for instance,
that a majority of the French lamented the defeat while wishing for the
armistice, that they were able to applaud Marshal Petain fervently while
rejecting the Vichy regime, and could be implacably hostile to the occupying
forces without ever becoming resisters; we even know that some of
them helped save Jews while maintaining a loyal attitude toward the Head
of State. These observations, noted by many, have given rise to varying
interpretations, often accompanied by considerations of a moral nature.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11</a>]
One hears of the French people’s schizophrenia, but also of their talent
for adapting and shifting their loyalties, their ability to follow the prevailing
winds, as well as their tendency toward indecisiveness. This has been
interpreted as calculating opportunism, duplicity, cynicism, and spinelessness.
In many people’s minds, then, ambivalence and ambiguity were
two sides of the same coin.<br>
<br>
Without denying the potential validity of value judgments, the notion
of ambivalence opens other doors to the historian, broadening the possibilities
of analysis. It allows one to think about the contradictions in terms
of more than mere antinomies—resisters <i>or</i> Pétainists, Gaullists <i>or</i> fencesitters—
to push past the familiar binary oppositions and seek to understand
what they tell us beyond the half-truths of their overt meaning. Taking
into account the ambivalence in people’s minds helps us understand that
the general evolution of the conflict and Germany’s predicted defeat do
not offer sufficient elements to explain everything. The majority of the
French were not Vichy supporters initially and then resisters, or Pétainists
who then turned Gaullist. Rather, they may well have been a little bit of
both simultaneously, for varying lengths of time depending on the individual.
In a recent interview,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> Simone Veil repeated how difficult it is for
us now to grasp the complexity of those times, and said of the French
that ‘some behaved well, others badly, many did both at the same time’.
She added ‘ ... things weren’t as simple as people portray them today’.
By taking both sides of the matter into account, Simone Veil’s judgment
approaches the truth more closely, especially when considered in the light
of the problems raised by the effort to pass an overall judgment on
‘average’ French behavior, which can never reflect the multiple singularities
of lived experience.<br>
<br>
<b>A Culture of Duality</b><br>
<br>
The image of the French people harboring within themselves opposing
emotions, tom between contradictory impulses rather than entrenched in
hostile camps, cannot be reduced to a mere manifestation of double-dealing.
It refers back to the notion of a dual man,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> who is both one
thing and the other, more as a result of external pressures than out of
self-interest. Double think belongs to the mental universe of the French
under Vichy: it is one of its realities, it reveals one of the modes of
operation of systems of representation, and underscores its importance.
Further study of double think might help to illuminate the prominent place
that ambivalent modes of thought occupy in public opinion. Their
characteristic features might be seen to spring from the broad development
of a kind of culture of duality and its accompanying effects. Hence,
the culture of duality was not a feature of clear conscience, nor was it
experienced as an agonizing contradiction; rather, duality was a form
of acculturation that came to shape everyday thinking, whether in the
mundane activities of daily life, or in extraordinary situations where one
had to weigh the risks of taking sides. In order to survive, the French had
to learn very quickly to live with two images of themselves: one public
face for the sake of appearances and survival, and one hidden face to
preserve a certain way of being and to take action.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Traces of duality
were everywhere; they became a familiar feature of the landscape and
created a pattern of dual living, examples of which come easily to mind.
The two main zones that made up the nation resulted in a double mental
representation of the country, and there were two ways of conceiving of
France, the London way and the Vichy way. Within the narrow confines
of the Vichy realm, there were still two more ways of being French: Pierre
Laval’s way and that of Marshal Pétain. A majority of the French people
saw the old Marshal himself as a double man, identified with the secret
Strategy—insistently attributed to him—of playing a double game. Until
November 1942, the press and authorized magazines in the free zone
were read through a subtle deciphering of a double language.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> Finally,
choosing to go underground meant living a double life, with double days
and double identities, while the shortages of everything imposed a double
Market . . . <br>
<br>
<b>The Gray Areas of Double Think</b><br>
<br>
Despite its murkiness and confusions, double think came about as a means
of getting around a reality that had become unbearable, as a fitting <b>(p.187)</b> 
response to an exceptional situation, as one element of a larger process
of adaptation. However, let us not be naive: it is clear that the gray areas
of ambivalence entail the risk of falling into compromising positions. To
make a reasonable judgment, one must use chronology as a first gauge.
Until the fall of 1942, it was possible for two concepts of France to coexist
in the same mind. Beyond that point, however, with the multiplication of
ever more obvious signs of collusion between Vichy and Nazi Germany,
it goes without saying that ambivalence took on a whole new dimension.
One could no longer claim to be simultaneously a resister and a Vichy
supporter without turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the realities of
collaboration, or deliberately playing into the machinations of the double
game. Double think then became a ‘matter of splitting oneself in two’;
as Georges Bernanos wrote in 1943 of the behavior of those government
bureaucrats who refused to resign: ‘their consciences cross oceans to fly
to freedom’s rescue, but their civil-servant bodies stay put’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a><br>

The uncertain waverings of ambivalence and the safety of fence-straddling
shed additional light on the real resources and great strain of a
harshly tried people.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> Far removed from heroic behaviors and loud
refusals, double think emerges as a form of social response to alternatives
deemed insurmountable. A response specific to that time that must be
considered as such, and as a poignant attempt to negotiate between desire
and the attainable. Although its meaning seems to elude any single interpretation,
it may have had a pedagogical function in helping people
mentally prepare to accept other harsh contradictions imposed by the
necessities of war. Hence, despite the number of victims and the exploitation
of the situation by the German and Vichy propaganda machines, the
violent 1944 Allied bombings of the country were endured with dignity—
and this at a time when the German army’s reprisals against civilian
populations were steadily intensifying. Simone de Beauvoir refers to this
in one of her emotional letters to Nelson Algren, after bluntly describing
the horror of a train machine-gunned by British and American planes: ‘It
was all happening at the end of the war, as you were trying to stop the
trains and destroy the locomotives, as you had to; no one was indignant
about it, we were just a little scared.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a><br>
<br>
In breaking down the mechanisms of the society of the spectacle and
of the practice of pseudo-simulation, Guy Debord issues the powerful
injunction: ‘Political? Social? There has to be a choice. What is one cannot
be the other.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> The double think of the French people, their strain and
their confusion remind us how difficult it is to press the thick texture of
the social into the narrow strictures of a binary culture.<br>

<br>
1. <i>Essais</i>, book II, chapter XIV, ‘On Fame’ (Paris, 1962).<br>
<br>
2. To quote the words of President Georges Pompidou during his 21 September 1972 press conference: ‘Isn’t it time to throw off the veil, to forget these times when the French did not love one another, tore one another apart, and even killed one another .. .’ See <i>Le Monde</i> of 23 September 1972, and Henry Rousso, <i>Le Syndrome de Vichy de 1944 à nos jours</i> (Paris, 1990).<br>
<br>
3. ‘Everything today contributes to the obsessive recollection of Vichy’, observed once again, and like so many others, Pierre Nora in the 1 October 1997 issue of <i>Le Monde</i>.<br>
<br>
4. One can only quote, once again, Marc Bloch’s famous apostrophe, which he wrote after realizing that empty rehabilitations were only following hollow prosecutorial speechifying: ‘Robespierrerians, anti-Robespierrians, we beg you for mercy: please, just tell us who was Robespierre’: <i>Apologie pour l’Histoire ou métier d’historien</i> (Paris, 1974).<br>
<br>
5. One opinion among many: on Sunday, 20 March 1994, Jacques Attali, a former special adviser to President François Mitterrand, was thus able to assert on Radio J’s ‘Forum’: ‘ . . . since the war, we have been living a double lie personified by two presidents of the Republic . . .  De Gaulle made the French believe they were resisters, when in fact they were collaborationists. Mitterrand made the French believe that they were leftists, when in fact they were right-wing. This double façade ... has been hiding a reality: France was collaborationist’ (<i>Le Monde</i>, 22 March 1994). For a differing viewpoint on a debate the French never seem to tire of, one might also consult, for example, François Maspero’s article ‘Tous coupables?’ [All guilty?], published in the same newspaper on 11 December 1997.<br>
<br>
6. Etienne Fouilloux, <i>Les chrétiens français entre crise et libération, 1937-1947</i> (Paris, 1997).<br>
<br>
7. In the spring of 1939, looking back on his publication’s hostility to the Munich Accords, Emmanuel Mounier wrote: ‘If our reaction was so violent last October . . . , it is because we suddenly felt a kind of deathly languor in our country, that first blackout of the will that foreshadows its upcoming surrender.’ (<i>Esprit</i>, no. 80, May 1939).<br>
<br>
8. Jean Guéhenno, <i>Journal des annees noires, 1940-1944</i> (Paris, 1947).<br>
<br>
9. Many contemporaries of the period admitted, only a few years after the end of the Occupation, that they had become incapable of deciphering the meaning of the allusions and subtleties that had fed their need for daily protest. Cf. for example Charles d’ Aragon’s testimony in <i>La Résistance sans héroïsme</i> (Paris, 1977). The <i>Esprit</i> case is exemplary, as its editors were to confess, at the Liberation, their inability to understand their own writings: ‘ . . . sometimes only in the furthest recesses of our memory can we now find the event, so well-known to all at the time, that gave this commentary its edge . . . ’ (<i>Esprit</i>, January 1945).<br>
<br>
10. Chronicles or memoirs of that period are full of examples. This is particularly true of Leon Werth’s <i>Deposition, Journal, 1940-1944</i> (Paris, 1992), edited and introduced by Jean-Pierre Azéma. Much of my work points to this characteristic feature of the modes of thought during the years of occupation.<br>
<br>
11. It is occasionally the case, in matters of history, that moral judgments may hide a surrender in the face of the effort necessary to understand.<br>
<br>
12. Interview with journalist Eric Conan, <i>L’Express</i>, 9 October 1997.<br>
<br>
13. In January 1937, in Toulouse’s <i>La Dépêche</i>, Emile Vandevelde titled his review of Aragon’s novel <i>Les beaux quartiers</i> ‘Les hommes doubles’ [the dual men]. One of the book’s characters states: ‘we are living through historic times that will maybe one day be known as: the time of dual men’. In the preface he wrote for the book’s 1965 reissue, Aragon goes back to the dual men theme, which, according to him, was only picked up on at the beginning of the 1960s. Cf. Roger Garaudy, <i>L’itinéraire d’Aragon</i> (Paris, 1961 ). My gratitude goes to Edouard Ruiz, to whom I owe this information.<br>
<br>
14. These observations are inspired by Joffre Dumazedier’s testimony, in the May 1981 <i>Esprit</i>.<br>
<br>
15. On this, consult ‘Des revues sous l’occupation’, <i>La revue des revues, Revue internationale d’histoire et de bibliographie</i>, Paris, no. 24, 1997. In addition to other contributions, the study of the positions taken by the periodical <i>Esprit</i> in 1940 deals with the matter of camouflaged language.<br>

<br>
17. Reflecting back on the weaknesses of the French, the resister Jean Cassou said, after the Liberation, that it was better to speak of ‘average cowardice than of average villainy’: <i>Une vie pour la liberté</i>  (Paris, 1981). Nearly 40 years earlier, in April 1944, the resister Jacques Bingen wrote in his letter testament: ‘not to forget, after the glorious victory, that if France is a great lady, the French will be quite tired’. One will need to have for them ‘not only a lot of ambition, but also a lot of forgiving tenderness’.<br>
