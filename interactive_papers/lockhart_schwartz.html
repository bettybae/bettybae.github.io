		<h4>Brazilian beginnings</h4>
		<br>

		<p>
		The patterns of Brazil's early colonization are in many ways parallel to those encountered in the peripheries of Spanish America, as will be seen in Chapter 8. The semisedentary nature of the Indian inhabitants, the apparent lack of precious metals, and the basically extractive nature of the economy, geared to exploiting local products like dyewood, all exerted an influence. But the Portuguese had their own previous traditions of expansion in Africa and the Atlantic islands, which were brought to bear in the colonization of Brazil. In fact, a major distinguishing factor of Brazilian colonization that set it apart from Spanish America was the continuing simultaneous Portuguese effort in Asia. For Spain, America was the chief target of colonial expansion; for Portugal, it was not. This fact helps to explain much of the Brazilian colony's early history when considered in conjunction with the local conditions that confronted the Portuguese.
		</p>

		
		<br>
		<h4>The dyewood phase</h4>
		<br>
		
		
		<p>
		The Portuguese maritime thrust toward Asia gained considerable momentum toward the close of the fifteenth century. When Vasco da Gama finally reached India in 1498, the way lay open for circum-Africa commerce with the East. A second expedition set sail for India in 1500 under the command of Pedro Alvares Cabral. On the outward voyage, swinging wide around the hump of West Africa, Cabral made a landfall on an unknown coast. Contact was established with the local inhabitants, a little trade and exploration took place, and then the fleet's secretary composed a report which Cabral dispatched back to Lisbon while he himself with the other ships continued on to India. Cabral called his discovery "Land of the Holy Cross" (Santa Cruz), a name that was soon replaced in practice by "Brazil" because of the many dyewood, or brazilwood, trees that grew along the coast. Although some Portuguese authors have argued that their vessels had already secretly discovered this coast, it seems clear from the tone of surprise and wonderment in the letter of 1500 that such contacts, if they ever took place, had made no impact even on Portuguese mariners.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Brazil received little royal attention for the next thirty years. The crown at this time was simply too preoccupied with the riches of India to pay much attention to a seemingly savage land whose only attractions were exotic birds and dyewood trees. Unwilling to invest royal resources of manpower and capital on a large scale, crown turned to private individuals who were prepared to do so in return for the rights of exploitation. A monopoly contract for dyewood cuttings was granted to a group of New Christian investors on condition that they explore the coast, provide some defense, and, of course, surrender a percentage of the profit to the crown. So long as wealth was not immediately apparent, both Iberian crowns seemed willing to make wide concessions to private individuals in order to have them assume the burden of explorations, although residual royal control was always maintained in theory. The system of private initiatives and royal contracts had been employed by the Portuguese in Africa, and in many ways the techniques of the dyewood trade paralleled those previously used to extract gold, ivory, and slaves from West Africa. Small forts or trading stations were established at suitable landing sites, often islands, and a few men under a feitor, or manager, stayed behind to staff them. During their stay, the Portuguese would induce local Indians to cut dyewood trees and deliver the logs to the fort in return for trinkets and European trade goods. Arriving ships could thus be sure of finding cargoes of dyewood logs waiting at the trade forts. In the beginning, then, Portuguese contact with Brazil was limited to a series of feitorias (factories) analogous to those on the African coast; in the course of the sixteenth century, however, a number of internal pressures and external threats forced the Portuguese to initiate colonization and settlement.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Of immediate concern was the foreign threat, always more to be reckoned with on the eastern seaboard than elsewhere in Ibero-America. Soon after Cabral's land fait Spanish vessels began to visit the Brazilian coast during their voyages of exploration. The southern coast of Brazil became a frequent stopping place for ships heading toward the Rio de la Plata. Even more serious was the presence of the French. Small privately owned ships sailing from ports in Normandy and Brittany began to appear on the coast as early as 1504. Financed by merchants and lacking royal support, these ships were primarily engaged in the dyewood trade. Brazil wood produced a reddish-purple dye that was highly prized by European tapestry and cloth makers, so that the French were no less anxious than the Portuguese to exploit the Brazilian forests. The French court had never really accepted the claim of Spain and Portugal to the world beyond Europe, and French merchants and sailors were even less inclined to recognize Iberian pretensions. One said bitterly that the whole world was not large enough for the Portuguese, complaining that "as soon as they have sailed along a coast they claim possession of it and consider it a conquest."
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The competition was fierce. Both sides made trade agreements and alliances with Indian groups while raiding the forts and shipping of their rivals. From the point of view of Portugat which claimed Brazil for itself, the French were interlopers, little better than pirates. Diplomatic complaints to the French court had little effect because of the private nature of the French presence, and the Portuguese turned to organized military activity. A number of naval expeditions cleared the coast of French shipping, but after each sweep, the French returned. By 1530 it was clear that Portugal was faced with a choice: take possession of Brazil in some more permanent way or lose this land to active European rivals.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		In that year another naval expedition was dispatched with instructions to clear the French from the coast and continue explorations. In addition, this large fleet also carried the men and materials needed to establish a permanent settlement. The commander, Martim Afonso de Sousa, received extensive judicial and administrative powers to carry out the colonizing aims of the expedition. After cruising along the coast and capturing a number of French vessels, Martim Afonso established a town at Sao Vicente in 1532. It was Brazil's first.
		</p>
		
		
		<br>
		<h4>From donatary captaincies to royal government</h4>
		<br>

		
		<p>
		Even while the Martim Afonso expedition was under way, the Portuguese crown was formulating plans for a permanent and stable colonial occupation able to resist foreign encroachment and exploit Brazil's potential. News of the exploits of Cortes and the wealth of Mexico was probably not lost on the court at Lisbon, and in Brazil there had long been rumors of emerald mountains and silver mines lying somewhere in the unknown interior (sertiio). Martim Afonso himself had sent an entrada of eighty men to search for treasure rumored to be in the interior, but without success. Both the apparent possibilities and the reality of the dyewood trade called for decisive action, but Portugal was still too preoccupied with Asia to commit royal resources on a large scale to Brazil. Once again, the solution was to depend on private initiative and interest, stimulated by state action and the guarantee of royal law and military force.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The Portuguese crown characteristically turned to a time-tested set of institutional arrangements developed in the two previous centuries. As we have seen, these had already been modified and used to carry out settlement on the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores. The main feature was the hereditary seigneury or donatary captaincy, under which lordship over extensive territories on the Brazilian coast was granted out between 1533 and 1535. The gentlemen who received the grants or donations (donatdrios) were given broad powers of jurisdiction, taxation, and other administrative and fiscal privileges usually reserved in Portugal to the highest nobility. Whereas in some ways the seigneury was an archaic form that seemed to move in a direction contrary to royal centralization, these grants were not "feudal" in either law or practice. They were made as a reward for services rendered and were not dependent upon the usual feudal obligations of vassal to lord. Moreover, their purpose was economic development. Although some donataries wished to use the grants to support a noble life-style and a few had the pretensions of "feudal" lords, such attitudes were strongly opposed by both the local colonists and the crown.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Fifteen donatary captaincies were created, dividing the Brazilian coast into strips of territory of varying length (see Map 6). No one knew what lay in the interior, but in theory the boundaries of each captaincy extended to the line of Tordesillas that divided the lands held by Spain from those claimed by Portugal. The donatarios or captains could establish towns, appoint officers, and distribute land to settlers. Moreover, since the whole purpose of the donatary captaincies in Brazil was to stimulate settlement and encourage economic development, the crown offered certain financial benefits to the potential recipients of the grants. Each was to receive ten leagues of coast as his own property, control over the Indian slave trade, a percentage of the dyewood trade, and monopoly control over mills and other capital improvements. The form of the donatary captaincy came directly from Portugal's medieval experience, but it was now adapted to meet the needs of colonial expansion.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Among the key powers of the lord proprietors and most important as a means of stimulating colonization was the right to distribute sesmarias, or land grants. In medieval Portugal reclaimed lands and those captured from the Moors had been redistributed by the crown by means of sesmarias. The crown usually appointed an individual to distribute the lands, and the recipients were obliged to work and improve them. Here again was an institution from Portugal's past that could be adapted to the Brazilian situation. The lord proprietors, by receiving the right to hand out sesmarias, had a means to attract colonists and to initiate settlement. But there was a curious paradox here. Whereas the sesmarias in Portugal had created a class of small copyholders or peasants, in Brazil, where land was seemingly endlessly available, the sesmarias were often enormous and in the long run resulted in a system of great holdings. The regulations that only as much land could be given as could be used were ignored, and by the late seventeenth century some families in Brazil held sesmarias that together were larger than whole provinces in Portugal.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Despite the various attractions of the Brazilian donatary captaincies, the great magnates and nobles of Portugal were not much interested. Instead, the recipients of the grants were minor fidalgos, gentry from the court at Lisbon, a few royal bureaucrats, and a good number of persons who had fought in the Portuguese conquests in India. Martim Afonso de Sousa and his brother received two grants each, but they were almost the only donatarios with previous Brazilian experience. The majority lacked the expertise, connections, or financial resources to make their captaincies a success. The four northernmost captaincies were never settled, and four others failed because of mismanagement and poor relations with the Indians. Within twenty years the crown was moved to take direct control. The era of the donatary captaincies was thus short-lived and has the aura of failure, yet during this period a number of social and economic patterns were established that continued long after direct royal control had been established. For that reason let us pause for a moment to examine some examples of captaincies that succeeded or failed and to take note of the patterns and processes set in motion.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		In reality a precolonization stage of unplanned and uncontrolled contact preceded the captaincies and in some places made subsequent settlement possible. During the first years after the European discovery of Brazil, sailors and others had jumped ship, been stranded, or put ashore as punishment or for other reasons. Cabral himself had left two penal exiles among the Indians to become versed in their language. At various places along the coast these transfrontiersmen had settled among the tribes, taken wives, and raised mestifo (or as they were also called in Brazil, mameluco) families. Trusted by the Indians and integrated into their families by marriage and blood, these men became intermediaries between the Portuguese and the Indians. Wherever they had established themselves, the chances for trade and subsequent settlement were good. At the Bay of All Saints, Diogo Alvares, called Caramuru, lived among his large family and was greatly respected by both Indians and Portuguese. The settlement of Sao Paulo was made possible by Joao Ramalho, a Portuguese castaway and longtime resident of the area. On the southern coast Portuguese ships came to depend on the mysterious bacharel (lawyer) of Cananea who for some crime or misadventure had resided on the coast in exile for many years. Martim Afonso's nearby town of Sao Vicente was placed, in fact, at a site where a few Portuguese had already settled among the local Indians.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Martim Afonso de Sousa and his brother received the four southernmost captaincies. Colonization efforts centered on Sao Vicente, the area of coastline near the town of that name, and on the subsequently more important port of Santos. Settlement concentrated around these tiny coastal enclaves, but eventually, in order to secure an adequate food supply, a town was established on the inland plateau at the Indian village of Piratininga. This town was later to become the city of Sao Paulo. Much of the success of the captaincy depended on the relatively good relations established with the Tupiniquin tribes of the coast and plateau. Without European women, the colonists married the mixed-blood descendants of the castaways and often took Indian women as wives and concubines. These interpersonal ties created a firm basis of alliance between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquin, as did the military aid given to them against their Indian enemies.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Perhaps just as important to Sao Vicente's success was its sound economic base. The area had very little dyewood, but Martim Afonso's connections in Lisbon were excellent. He was able to convince both Portuguese and foreign merchants to invest in the captaincy'sdevelopment, and before long a number of sugar mills were operating near the coast. Martim Afonso himself was part owner of the largest mill. It was eventually acquired by the Schetz merchant family based in Antwerp. Other non-Portuguese also invested, and some took residence in the colony. Economically, Sao Vicente looked much like Madeira: a Portuguese overseas venture financed to a large extent with foreign capital in order to produce sugar for the European market. Sao Vicente was eventually surpassed as a sugar producer by the captaincies of the northeast, but in the sixteenth century it was one of the few successes of the captaincy system.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Captaincies that failed are also instructive. Porto Seguro was given to a wealthy gentleman of Viana do Castelo in the north of Portugal. He sold his properties and set sail for Brazil with family, retainers, and a good number of colonists from the densely populated province of Minho as well as many Spaniards from neighboring Galicia. Mostly poor fisherfolk, they tended to re-create the fishing villages of the Iberian Atlantic coast in the colony they established. The fact that many married couples came may help explain their consistently poor relations with the Indians, since there was little intermarriage. A few sugar mills were constructed, but the colony was ripped apart by internal dissension; the donatario himself was denounced to the Inquisition for heresy and sent back to Portugal in chains. There was a similar failure in the neighboring captaincy of Ilheus, which had possibilities as a sugar producer. There the constant attacks by Aimore Indians made life precarious and kept the colonists limited to a narrow strip of coastline. Eventually, the donatary captain sold his rights to a Florentine merchant resident in Lisbon. 
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The captaincy of Bahia should have succeeded. The area of the Bay of All Saints had long been a favorite stopping place for the dyewood cutters, and Caramuru, along with a few other Portuguese and many of their mixed offspring, had excellent relations with the local Tupinamba peoples of the coast. The donatary captain, an old veteran of campaigns in India named Francisco Pereira Coutinho, tried to develop his seigneury by bringing his family and other colonists, distributing sesmarias for farms, and encouraging the construction of sugar mills. But Pereira Coutinho proved to be a poor administrator and some of the colonists, ignoring the admonitions of Caramuru, began to encroach on Indian lands. Factions developed, and soon the donatary and his backers were forced to flee the captaincy. Relations with the Indians continued to deteriorate. When Pereira Coutinho tried to return, his ship met with disaster in the Bay of All Saints and he, along with most of his followers, was killed by the Tupinamba. The fast-talking Caramuru escaped.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Of all the donatary captaincies, Pernambuco enjoyed the most success. Its donatary, Duarte Coelho Pereira, came from obscure origins, but after twenty years of military and diplomatic service in India and a fortunate marriage into the distinguished Albuquerque family he was rewarded with one of the Brazilian grants. In 1535 he set sail for Pernambuco along with his wife, her brother, and a large contingent of colonists, many of whom were from Viana do Castelo in the overcrowded province of Minho. Towns were founded at igaragu and Olinda and sesmarias were distributed to the colonists. Pernambuco had long been a major area of dyewood loading, visited by both French and Portuguese ships, and dyewood had provided the captaincy its first economic activity, but Duarte Coelho was not willing to let matters rest on brazilwood alone. He used his financial connections in Lisbon to secure backing for a number of sugar mills, and by 1542 at least one was in operation. In the same year he requested and received permission to bring African slaves to labor in the sugar industry.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		A major part of Pernambuco's success is explained by the normalization of relations with the Indians. The French and their Indian allies remained hostile, and fighting continued until 1560, but an alliance was formed with the Tabajaras. The donatary's brother-in-law, Jeronimo de Albuquerque, married the daughter of a principal Indian leader after a Pocahontas-style rescue. He eventually fathered eight legitimate children, plus five mameluco children by other women. This created a familial tie between the donatary's kin and a major Indian group, a tie which was extended by other such unions, and in general, Duarte Coelho seems to have sponsored miscegenation. Thus, unlike other captaincies, Pernambuco could depeIld on Indian allies, supplies of food, and occasionally workers. Less dependent on Europe for labor, Duarte Coelho could refuse to accept the penal exiles whom Portugal sometimes sent out as 'colonists. When he returned to Portugal in 1554 to manage his affairs, his wife, Beatris de Albuquerque, remained in Brazil as donatary until her son reached majority. By 1585 Pernambuco was a thriving plantation colony with more than sixty sugar engenhos in operation, by far the most prosperous region of Brazil.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		But Pernambuco was an exception. The captaincies had generally failed as a tool of colonization. The mere attempt of one small, already overcommitted country to establish so many colonies simultaneously invited disaster; though encouraged by the open coastline, it subverted the more natural one-area-at-a-time process of Spanish expansion, in which each successful foundation provided capital, experience, and people for the next. In fact, the overall result of the captaincy experiment was not exactly failure but the establishment of the very small number of viable settlements which the situation of the time could bear. Even when successful the captaincies were bound to be transitional, because of their ambiguous nature and the conflicting goals of crown, donataries, and colonists. The broad seigneurial powers of the donataries recalled a bygone age in Europe, yet the captaincies were clearly designed for development and the donataries viewed their domains as profit-making enterprises.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Development really depended on the colonists and the role that they would play in the new land. Whereas donataries the wished to re-create senhorios, albeit for capitalistic ends, the colonists were not at all willing to see the disadvantages of Portugal reborn in Brazil. They had not left the crowded fields of Minho or the rocky slopes of Beira to play the same roles in Brazil that they had played at home. The incessant squabbling in almost all the captamCIes, mclud.mg Pernambuco, between the donatary with his kinsmen and retainers on one side and the colonists on the other demonstrated the latter s rejection of the roles and positions designed for them in the captaincy system. To the colonists, Brazil represented social mobility through the acquisition of land and through it opportunities to live "nobly," surrounded by family and dependents. But the colonists, like the donataries realized that success depended on integration into the commercial structure of Europe and that this could be achieved only by exporting dyewood or the new crop, sugar. Dyewood was by law a monopoly of the crown and the donatanes or their contractors. Sugar offered the hope of success, wealth, and status, but for this crop land alone was worthless. One needed capital or credit and most of alllabor. We shall see shortly that the search for workers became the major theme of sixteenth-century Brazil, with far-reaching social implications for the colony's subsequent development.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Both the widespread failures and the few successes of the captaincy system caused Portugal to attempt some other form of government in Brazil. The foreign threat had not disappeared and relations with the Indians in many places were poor, and in general the donatary captaincies had been unable to create stable and profitable colonies. At the same time, the growing sugar industry of Sao Vicente and Pernambuco demonstrated to the crown that the possibilities for profit in Brazil far exceeded the simple trading fort stage of exploitation so long employed in Africa. Then, too, the Portuguese were not unaware of the Spanish discovery of the great silver mines of Potosi 1545, which once again raised the possibility that similar mineral wealth might be found in Brazil.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Reacting to these circumstances, the crown sent out in 1549 a large expedition under the direction of Tome de Sousa, who was appointed governor-general of Brazil. With him came a royal treasurer, a chief magistrate, and other colonists, as well as artisans, soldiers, colonists, and penal exiles. Also in the expedition were six Jesuits, the first of the regular orders in Brazil. The Crown directed de Sousa to establish his capital at the Bay of All Saints, which was centrally located, had potential as a sugar-producing area, and was unencumbered by donatarial privilege because of the death of the incumbent. A new city, Salvador, was created as the royal capital, placing Brazil under centralized control. The governor-general was granted wide administrative powers, some of which were in conflict with those previously given to the donataries. The captaincies could not be abolished legally, and the crown simply imposed centralized royal government upon the existing system. A few donataries like Duarte Coelho fought ardently to protect their rights. The crown, in fact, did not recapture full control from the descendants of some of the donataries until the eighteenth century, and proprietary captaincies, although more limited in scope and smaller in scale, were even given out anew in the seventeenth century. But the general trend was for increasing state control at the expense of private colonizing initiative and prerogatives. In many ways the process paralleled developments in Spanish America. After a period of royal concessions to private individuals and the formation of a colonial society with a somewhat autonomous economic base, the Iberian crowns began to limit the centrifugal tendencies created by this situation. What had been ceded in the period of conquest and discovery to stimulate private initiative and participation now was recalled as the American colonies gained the potential to be steady producers of revenue.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		With royal government firmly established in Brazil, Tome de Sousa and his successors, notably the vigorous and ruthless Mem de Sa (governor-general, 1558-74), increased the level of centralization, expanded bureaucratic and fiscal control, and stimulated economic development. Defense was still a matter of royal concern, for by the 1550S the French were back on the coast in force. This time they established a colony in Guanabara Bay, and although Antarctic France, as it was called, was often torn by factionalism between Catholics and Huguenots, the Portuguese perceived its very existence as a threat to Brazil. They were correct. In the early 1560s an alliance of the French with a confederation of Indian groups placed all of southern Brazil in jeopardy. After considerable fighting, the Portuguese destroyed the French colony (1565-7) and established their own city in Guanabara Bay, Sao Sebastiao do Rio de Janeiro. It became seat of a second royal captaincy under the governorship of Salvador de Sa, Mem de Sa's nephew. For many years it was a poorer version of Bahia or Olinda, much under the influence of the Sa family. These events, coupled with a series of short and destructive military campaigns against the Indians around Bahia, secured the center of Portuguese population.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Centralization was greatly furthered by close collaboration between the royal government and the Jesuit order. The Jesuit effort in sixteenth-century Brazil was extraordinary in its effects and pervasiveness. The Jesuits received encouragement and financial support from royal officials and often served as advisers and confessors to the most important people in the colony. Here (as elsewhere outside the central areas) the order directed its primary efforts toward conversion of the Indians, and as a result, the church in early Brazil was a missionary church to a large extent, with the role of the bishops and the diocesan clergy severely limited. Yet if in many ways the Brazilian church was like the church in Spanish American fringe areas, in some respects the Jesuit role in Brazil paralleled that of the Franciscans in Mexico as the first and most important of the regular orders in the colony; the Brazilian Jesuits maintained their predominant position through most of the colonial period.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		They were never very many in number. In 1574 there were only 110 Jesuit priests in all of Brazil, but they made up in quality and activity what they lacked in numbers. The order had just been founded in 1540, and the first members to arrive in Brazil in 1549 were men of conviction, fervor, and ability. Father Manoel da Nobrega, who led the group that arrived with Tome de Sousa, immediately set to work converting Indians and thundering out against the sexual license and moral laxity of the colonists. At the same time he became an ardent advocate of the colony, and his letters were filled with phrases such as "anyone who wishes to live in an earthly paradise must come to Brazil" and "never did I see a Flemish tapestry as beautiful as this land." Such advocacy was appreciated by a royal government that was seeking to colonize. In fact, N6brega and his secretary, Father Jose de Anchieta, worked closely with royal officials. They were very much responsible for the creation of the town of Sao Paulo in 1557 and for pacifying the Indians in the south. Jesuit colleges (schools) were established in all the important coastal towns and each was usually supported by the crown, often by means of sesmarias granted to them. Brazilian education to a large extent remained a Jesuit enterprise for the next three centuries.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Royal support of the Jesuit effort was supplemented and far exceeded by the Jesuits' own economic activities. Unlike the Franciscans, the Jesuits had no vow of poverty, and they quickly turned to agriculture and stock raising to support their activities in Brazil. Their engenhos and ranches were often the largest and best run. Such economic success coupled with their position against Indian slavery made them the target of constant complaint and occasionally of threatened violence. Nevertheless, their close ties to royal officials and local governors often placed the Jesuits at the fulcrum of politics as well as religious life in the early colony.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		For thirty-five years the Jesuits had the Brazilian colony nearly to themselves. When the Franciscans and the Carmelites arrived in the 1580s, they were forced to accommodate themselves to a situation and forms already created by the Jesuits. The Franciscan monasteries, often beautifully built, were sometimes located in smaller rural communities. The Carmelites and the Benedictines raised beautiful churches and engaged in agriculture and ranching to some extent. These other orders, especially the Franciscans, also embarked on a missionary campaign and by the seventeenth century were extremely important in the Maranhao, but they generally lacked the degree of royal support enjoyed by the Jesuits. As far as religious life was concerned, the sixteenth century was the Jesuit century.

		By the decade of the 1570S the major features of Portuguese Brazil had taken shape. Royal government had been established, supplanting the earlier phase of private initiative to some extent, but the area of bureaucratic control was limited to a narrow band along the coast and the area surrounding the small towns and cities. The interior remained for the most part unknown, still a realm of mythical treasures and real danger from still independent Indian groups. Entradas of prospectors and slavers or missionaries occasionally penetrated deeply into the setae, or backlands, but effective control in these areas did not exist. There were no wealthy empires or groups of sedentary Indians upon whom to levy tribute in the Brazilian interior and hence little to attract the majority of colonists. What Brazil offered to most was easy access to land and through the profits to be made in sugar the possibility of wealth and social mobility. Settlement concentrated on the seacoast, where the climate and land were right for sugar and where transportation was inexpensive. The sugar mills constantly needed supplies from Portugal and the sugar was destined for European markets. By the last decades of the sixteenth century Brazil no longer resembled the "factory" colonies of West Africa or Asia and had become a colony of settlement, but of a particular kind: a tropical plantation colony capitalized from Europe and created on the periphery of Europe's economy to supply a growing market. Socially, the colony was marked by a high degree of differentiation between the Portuguese colonists or officials and the Indian and African slaves and laborers. To comprehend the formation of Brazilian society, it is necessary to understand the transformation of Portuguese-Indian relations and the eventual large-scale dependence on African slaves, topics to which we now turn.

		<h4>Indian and African labor in Brazil</h4>
		<br>
		
		
		<p>
		At the time of the Portuguese arrival on the coast, much of it was occupied by Tupian-speaking peoples who lived in semisedentary villages of 400 to 800 people divided into large lineage units occupying from four to eight long houses. They raised the South American staple crop, manioc, hunted, fished, and gathered various forest products. The men devoted much of their attention to warfare against their Tupian neighbors and against peoples of different tongues whom the Tupians and later the Portuguese collectively called Tapuyas (savages), probably because they did not practice agriculture. Among Tupian groups like the Tupinamba of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro or the Tupiniquin of Porto Seguro and Sao Vicente, warfare helped structure the society, since a man's status depended on his ability to kill and capture enemies and to present them for feasts of ritual cannibalism. The economy was very much part of the broader social system. Each lineage satisfied its own needs, and in the environment of coastal Brazil this was not at all difficult. There was little concern for surplus. Portuguese officials found such attitudes to be "barbaric" and "uncivilized," and they were often aghast at the seeming idleness of the men and their lack of concern about material possessions and surplus. Later, colonists would cite these very attitudes as justification for enslaving Indians in order to teach them the ways of civilized man.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		But in the early years there were not many problems caused by the great distance between Tupians and Portuguese concepts of economy. During the first thirty years of contact, relations were primarily those of barter. The Portuguese (and the French) needed the Indians to help drag dyewood logs to the trade forts and stations on the coast and to supply foodstuffs. In return for labor, logs, and manioc, the Europeans offered cheap trade goods, trinkets, cloth, and occasionally axes and iron. None of this was very disruptive to Indian life. Tree felling was a traditional male activity which could be organized on a village basis, and so long as the village had enough to eat there was no reluctance to barter with the surplus. With the advent of the captaincy system in the 1530S, the nature of Portuguese-Indian relations began to change radically. The donataries and the colonists wanted Indian services, commodities, and labor on a far more intensive and continual basis than had the dyewood cutters. Towns were being built and there were many more people to feed. But most of all, the lab or demands of the sugar industry were enormous. Barter was no longer able to satisfy the increasing European demands, and the Portuguese turned increasingly to the enslavement of Indians.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The older interpretation of the failure of the barter system in the 1530S is based on the assumption that both Portuguese and Indians acted as "economic men," making rational decisions in response to objective market conditions. It holds that no longer satisfied with trinkets, Indians increasingly demanded more expensive goods and firearms, thereby driving up the cost of labor. Moreover, the competition between dyewood cutters and colonists for Indian labor also gave the Indians a distinct economic advantage. This situation then impelled the Portuguese to turn to slavery.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		This interpretation, while correct in its outline of the shift from barter to slavery, probably overemphasizes the effect of the market on Indian reactions. The Indian economy was primarily one of use, not exchange, and was very much subordinate to other considerations such as lineage responsibilities. Semisedentary Tupians (and even more so the nonagricultural Tapuyas) showed little desire to accumulate more and more material goods. Once a man' had one iron ax, he did not need another until it wore out. In fact, too many possessions made movement for the village difficult. The acquisition of more goods would have meant a shift to a more sedentary life, which probably would not have been compatible with Tupian agriculture. Perhaps even more important was the transformation in the kind of labor now demanded of the Indians. The day-to-day, backbreaking work of sugar agriculture differed vastly from the intermittent demands of tree felling, which was, after all, a traditional male activity. Agriculture was not; it was women's work and the Tupian warriors refused to do it, especially since it left no time for warfare and ceremony. Above all, it brought the Tupians out of their own society to be immersed in a Portuguese context. Portuguese officials described the situation in the classic terms of colonialism: The "natives" were lazy, undependable, and irrational because they would not respond to economic incentives. To "civilize" them and teach them how to act like Europeans, the colonists argued, they had to be enslaved.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Barter did not disappear at once. The Portuguese still needed food supplied by the Indians and were willing to payor trade for it. During the building of Salvador, the workers and colonists often ate bread made with manioc flour acquired from the Indians. The needs for food and for plantation workers came into conflict. Slave raiding to acquire workers drove Indian villages away and thereby deprived the colonists, and especially the coastal towns, of an important supplier of food. To resolve the conflict, royal governors began to distinguish between the "good" Indians and "bad" Indians; the former accepted Christianity and Portuguese control and were willing to work or supply food and services. They could not be enslaved. The latter resisted conversion, ran away, and continued their old habits of warfare and cannibalism. Their enslavement was just. The colonists often acted, however, as if the distinctions were meaningless, and as sugar became increasingly important, the sugar planters tended to pay less and less attention to the niceties of royal law.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		By the 1540s there were three simultaneous and often apparently conflicting Indian policies being followed by various Portuguese groups or institutions. The crown, urged by the Jesuits, sought to integrate the Indians peacefully into colonial society by conversion and acceptance of European norms of behavior including wage labor. The colonists were not averse to this, but they argued that the only way it could be accomplished was by enslavement. The Jesuits, and later the other orders, disagreed. They believed that Indians could be maintained in their villages under ecclesiastic supervision and thereby be not only instructed in Christianity but also convinced to grow food or occasionally supply labor for the colony. In a sense, the Jesuits wanted to create an Indian peasantry as opposed to the slavery favored by the colonists. In the sugar-growing regions the colonists eventually won out. The Jesuit villages (aldeas) lasted the longest in peripheral regions like the Amazon and the southern borderlands of Brazil, where the demands of intensive agriculture were absent. Royal laws beginning in 1570 and repeated in 1595 and 1609 prohibited Indian slavery, but loopholes could always be found. One of the most effective was the "ransoming" of captives. Entradas would go into the sertcio to "ransom" Indians who had been captured and bound up by their enemies (indios da corda) in preparation for ritual execution. In return for this rescue, the Indians were forced to labor as slaves for the Portuguese. The possible abuses of this system are obvious. Indians were illegally enslaved, and the level of intertribal warfare increased as groups tried to satisfy the demands of the Portuguese.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Despite increasing royal support, the Jesuits were also forced by Brazilian conditions to modify their policies. By the 1560s they had abandoned the idea of carrying out conversion in the original Indian villages. Instead, Indians were brought to live in aldeas, which were supposed to replicate the Indian villages but were under Jesuit auspices and were much more akin to European communities in plan and organization. By prohibiting warfare, ritual cannibalism, polygamy, and cross-cousin marriage and not always respecting indigenous sociopolitical units, the Jesuits struck at some of the fundamental aspects of Indian society. So, despite the protection from enslavement that the aldeas offered, many Indians chose flight or even working on engenhos rather than the regulated life of the aldeas. The Jesuits were, however, ardent and able missionaries. Instruction was given in a simplified form of Tupf called the lingua geral, and grammars and catechisms were prepared in it by the clerics. Efforts were made to teach European trades as well as religion, and a modicum of self-government was also allowed in the aldea, although always under the paternal eye of the Jesuits. By the 1570S the idea of a full-scale Indian peasantry at the base of the colony's society no longer seemed feasible, and the Jesuits justified their continued control as serving more limited and practical purposes: supplying freemen (forros) to work for the colonists under wage labor conditions and Jesuit scrutiny and organizing auxiliaries for defense against hostile Indians and foreign interlopers. In some ways the Jesuit aldeas were an attempt to create a settled population where none had existed before, in order to supply necessary commodities and labor. They were parallel in this to the congregations of Spanish America, both being attempts to fix and concentrate the population and bring it under closer European control and at the same time to fill the ranks of Indian workers decimated by warfare, disease, and flight. They bore especially close resemblance to the kind of congregations often called "missions," which appeared where the indigenous population was less than sedentary and the Spanish population was thin; both types were alike in not being squarely based on already existing indigenous units and social mechanisms. In Spanish America the mission type of organization everywhere proved unable to stand up very long to a denser European resence, and so it was in Brazil too. Wherever the aldeas were close to zones of intensive export agriculture with its larger Portuguese populations and its demand for workers and land, there was no avoiding attrition, land loss, and epidemic disease. By the seventeenth century, the coastal aldeas were miserable little places with a few Indian families and a lonely priest or two.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The age of Indian labor in the core area of Brazil lasted for about sixty years (1540-1600). During most of this period the majority of workers in Brazil were free and slave Indians. On the plantations the distinctions between ransomed, enslaved, and free (forro) Indians were blurred. Portuguese wills sometimes bequeathed free Indians just as if they were property, and forros often did not receive their wages. In any case, treatment differed very little. In the sixteenth century the word "Indian" was often replaced by such terms as gentio (gentile) and negro da terra (native Black). Both terms reflected Portuguese perceptions of the Indians, and since "negro" was already strongly associated with "slave" in the Portuguese vocabulary, the use of this phrase also indicates a lack of distinction between slave and forro. As the number of engenhos grew, so too did the demand for laborers. Indians were brought in from the sertao and were also shipped from captaincy to captaincy. The whole Indian population of coastal Brazil was put under pressure, and each group was faced with the alternatives of fight, flight, or accommodation.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Indian labor provided the basis for the colony's growth and the first expansion of the sugar industry, but it had serious drawbacks from the Portuguese point of view. As we have seen, the Indians were resistant to agricultural labor; they fled at every opportunity, and they lacked the skills most highly prized in the sugar industry. Moreover, as elsewhere in the Americas, and especially in the lowland areas, they were highly susceptible to European diseases. In the 1560s smallpox and then measles ravaged the whole Brazilian coast. The Indians died in vast numbers. Whole villages disappeared. A third of all the Indians in Jesuit aldeas died, and at the engenhos the situation was just as bad. Slaving and resgate expeditions went farther and farther into the interior to fill the gaps, but replacement became more and more difficult. Faced with various kinds of Indian resistance, the high mortality rate, diminishing numbers, and increasing Jesuit opposition to slavery, the colonists began to turn to another labor source: the Atlantic slave trade.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		In Chapter 1 we discussed how in the fifteenth century agricultural labor was added to household servitude in the traditions of Iberian slavery in connection with the development of the sugar engenho complex in Iberia and the Atlantic islands. By the time of Cabral's landing in Brazil, Portugal had been carrying African slaves to Iberia and Madeira for almost sixty years and had developed techniques and institutions to handle this trade. These included the trading forts at Axim and Sao J orge da Mina and a customs house and registry in Lisbon (Casa dos Escravos). It is not surprising then that the Portuguese would seek to use African labor also in Brazil as it began to develop as a sugar colony. It might seem more surprising that the transition to African lab or was so slow, but the timing was dictated by the initially small ability of the struggling sugar industry to pay for large numbers of expensive imported slaves.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The first Black slaves in Brazil undoubtedly arrived as body servants or sailors in the early expeditions, and their presence has remained unrecorded. The donatary captains received permission to bring a few dozen Africans for work on the engenhos. In the 1540s Duarte Coelho in Pernambuco, Pero de Gois in the captaincy of Sao Tome (Rio de Janeiro), and others petitioned for the right to import Africans. A few were brought, but it was really in the period after 1560 that the Atlantic slave trade began to supply large numbers of Africans to the expanding export economy of Brazil. In the mid-1580s Pernambuco had sixty-six engenhos and some two thousand African slaves. If we estimate about a hundred slaves per engenho, we can see that Indians at that time still made up two-thirds of the mills' work force. Then in the following decades the transition gained momentum, leading eventually to an overwhelming predominance of African slaves in the sugar industry.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Assessing the overall reasons for the turn to African labor in the sugar industry, we have on the one hand the strong factor of precedent in Iberia and off Africa and on the other the proven and increasing difficulties with Indian labor which we have already enumerated. All over the world there has been a tendency to prefer the total outsider as a slave because he is cut loose from his own society and entirely without independent connection to the new land, hence less able to escape and resist, more open to learning new skills. In this case, the skills were not all new, for many of the Africans came from societies where intensive agriculture was common and where ironworking, cattle raising, and other arts useful in the engenhos were practiced. In the end, one must return to emphasis on the mortality differential. Although many Africans died in the terrible conditions of the slave ships or in the first year after arrival in Brazil, those who survived the acclimatization period were far less likely to succumb to Old World diseases than were the Indians. Maintaining an Indian population base in a hot lowland where there were many Europeans and an intense economic activity proved impossible anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		The result of all this was that the advantages of using Africans ultimately outweighed the high costs of transportation. From an early time planters felt that the investment of time and money in training an African in the specialized skills of sugar making was more likely to be rewarded than it was with an Indian. The few existing engenho slave lists from sixteenth-century Brazil show a picture familiar from Spanish America, usually recording the Africans as skilled laborers, artisans, or even managers among a body of Indian workers without special skills. Africans were enslaved, mistreated, and even when free suffered considerable social and economic disability, but they were part of the Old World tradition brought to America, auxiliaries in the creation of the colony, and generally they enjoyed much higher effective status than the Indians, just as in the Spanish Indies.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		In the view of all these factors, the productivity of Indian lab or was held to be very low in comparison to that of African; one African was thought to be able to do the work of three or four Indians. This was true in Mexico and Peru as well as Brazil. Such perceptions were strongly reflected in slave prices. An Indian slave in sixteenth century Brazil was generally valued at one-third the price of an African. Even among free laborers, Indians were invariably paid less than Africans or Brazilian-born Blacks. Again, the same differential existed all over Spanish America. But a major difference arose between northeastern Brazil and either the Spanish American central areas, where the Indian majority persisted as a base, or the Ibero-American fringe, where Indians were often scarce or not adaptable to European purposes but the settlers could not afford the alternative of African slaves. In northeastern Brazil, as in the New Granada gold mining district but on a much grander scale, the Europeans found themselves with a profitable export industry which could afford to make the transition to use of Africans not only as skilled labor and intermediaries but as the majority work force and base of the industry, here as field hands doing every task that the cultivation of sugar demanded. The same was to happen wherever lowland tropical export became viable in the New World.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		By the early decades of the seventeenth century, the transition to African lab or in the plantation zones of coastal Brazil was complete. The influx of large numbers of Africans changed the nature of the population and culture of colonial Brazil in ways that we will discuss subsequently; in fact, the point at which Africans were a majority in the lab or force and a significant population component marks the end of Brazil's beginning phase. Indian slavery or other forms of Indian labor survived in those parts of Brazil like Sao Paulo and the Amazon that were marginal to the dominant economy and were too poor to make the importation of Africans possible. In the sugar growing regions of the coast, Indians had provided large numbers of workers, "cheap labor," at a crucial time when the industry lacked capital. The results for the Indians were disastrous, but for the sugar industry, the Indians had made possible rapid expansion at less cost, playing the same transitional role as in other low-altitude regions such as the Caribbean islands and the New Granadan gold district. By 1600 the predominant social and economic patterns were laid down; Africans had replaced Indians as slaves, and Brazil had become the world's leading producer of sugar. In the northeast, the phase of existence as a fringe, with the typical fringe area complex of barter in natural products, armed hostilities, missions, Indian slavery, few Europeans and Africans, and relative governmental neglect, had come to an end.
