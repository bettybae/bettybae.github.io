<center><b></i>Introduction</center></b></i><br><br>

THIS penetrating, poignant, outspoken book stands out 
among other books about France and the first year of the 
Second World War as the work of a very distinguished 
scholar, a professor of the Sorbonne, who was later to be one of 
the leaders in the movement of resistance and to be put to death 
for his part in it. The book is a piece of analysis and a 
contemporary judgement by a man who wrote as a Frenchman, ‘that is to 
say, a civilized man, for the two are identical’, but also, and always, 
as a French historian who had earned the right to be heard.<br><br>
Marc Bloch began his career as a writer and teacher of history 
in 1905, in his twentieth year. His family was firmly established 
in France. He tells us that a great-grandfather fought in the 
revolutionary army in 1793, that his father fought in 1870. He 
himself fought in the First World War and, at the age of fifty- 
three, the father of six children, was again in service in 1939; but 
he wrote this book as a student of history. The turning-point 
in his academic life came, I think, in 1929, the year in which he 
gave a course of lectures at Oslo on the invitation of the 
Norwegian Institute for the Comparative Study of Institutions, for 
these lectures gave rise to his finest book, <i>Les Caractères originaux 
de l’histoire rurale française</i>; and it was in the same year that, with 
M. Lucien Febvre, he founded the <i>Annales d’histoire économique 
et sociale</i>, the periodical which he used as a forum, and through 
which he became one of the most influential economic and social 
historians of his time. During the years after the First World 
War he had tended to concentrate his attention upon that rather 
perplexing, because mysterious, region of the spirit where 
political and religious feelings met in the development of medieval 
kingship. His first considerable work, published in 1924, was 
<i>Les Rois thaumaturges</i>, ‘a study of the supernatural character 
<b>vi</b> attributed to the royal power, especially in France and England’. 
Its main theme was the growth of the curious practice known as 
touching for the king’s evil’, which most of us used to hear 
about in connexion with ‘Good Queen Anne’ and her alleged 
power, as a ruler of divine right, to cure scrofula. But, of course, 
Bloch was interested in it as the symbol and expression of an 
important development in religious thought and popular belief. 
It led him into new inquiries, for example, to the study of the 
cult and biographies of our last Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the 
Confessor. Indeed, some of us first made his acquaintance 
through his interest in English history, and to some scholars, 
interested as he had been in the study of kingship, he was 
always best known by the book to which I have referred. I 
remember vividly how one evening some twelve years later he 
was dining at high table in Oriel College. Another guest was a 
well-known German scholar, at that time spending a year in 
Oxford. Suddenly the German realized that the quiet reserved 
little man sitting on the opposite side of the table was Marc 
Bloch. He burst out in great excitement: Is that Bloch? the 
author of <i>Les Rois thaumaturges</i>? I have been wanting to meet 
him for years.’ At the time I was amused by the contrast between 
the scene and the conventional idea of a meeting of a staid 
Teuton with an ebullient Gaul; now my memory of that evening 
arouses sadder and deeper reflections about the comradeship of 
scholars all over the learned world, then so promising, now 
broken, though we hope broken only for a time.<br><br>

In the movement of international fellowship and 
understanding between scholars Bloch took an active part. As I have said, 
his book on rural France grew out of lectures given at Oslo. He 
was prominent in international conferences. He made his review 
one of the chief centres of learned studies in social history. He 
was in constant touch with friends and colleagues in other lands. 
Here in England he made many friends, especially in Cambridge 
and London, where he was welcomed by John Clapham and
<b>vii</b> Eileen Power and many others. English readers can judge the 
quality of his mind and the width of his learning in a chapter 
contributed by him to the first volume of the <i>Cambridge 
Economic History</i>. The news of his death on 16 June 1944, as it slowly 
and doubtfully became known to us, at first seemed unbelievable. 
His light had burned so brightly. This last swift little book of 
his, written with such passion, patriotism, and knowledge of the 
past, will in its English dress make him known to hundreds of 
people who never read his learned work—wise and clear though 
it is—and is his best memorial. <br><br>

<center><b><i>Foreword</i></b></center><br><br>

HOW admirable it is that this ‘Statement of Evidence’ 
could have been conceived, written, and hidden away 
for our future reading at a time when France was 
reeling beneath the thunder-clap of disaster.<br><br>

When our world was crumbling in an appalling confusion of 
men and things, when the land of Liberty, of the Rights of Man, 
of spiritual grandeur and civilized elegance, had, through the 
machinations of Vichy, taken on the semblance of a savage tribe 
bidden to make obeisance before barbarian totems and absurd 
taboos, when so many men of letters were rushing at top speed 
into the open arms of slavery—how admirable, indeed, that 
this great witness who, four years later, was to fall in the service 
of the Resistance, could thus uncover, could thus analyse with 
such lucidity, the secrets of one of the strangest defeats in all 
history. Read on and you will see....<br><br>

I say without hesitation that, till now, no account, no 
explanation of, no inquiry into, the events of 1940, has appeared 
comparable in clarity or in firmness of design. It is right that we 
should declare in no uncertain tones that this voice from the 
grave of a great civilian martyr, who died without for a single 
moment doubting that the dawn would break, has more true 
things to tell us about the evil which plunged France into 
darkness, than those of any of his contemporaries.<br><br>

Marc Bloch wrote this book, as he says himself, in ‘a white 
heat of rage’. It was the fine rage of a noble soul which would 
not acquiesce, of an intelligence which refused to come to terms 
with lies: it was the anger of a witness who <i>knew</i>. But this 
fighter in the chaos of defeat, this historian who was compelled 
to live through and endure one of the worst periods of our 
history, could, nevertheless, in spite of disgust, in spite of revolt, 
<b>x</b> give to his thought and to his style a fine serenity; could view 
the contemporary scene with a relentlessly objective eye. <i>Strange 
Defeat</i> has the movement, the tone, the accent of a study which 
has managed to fight free of the chaotic present, of the urgent 
and battering tide of immediate fact. Written though it was 
under the pressure of experience and with a burning immediacy, 
with the salt of the overwhelming billows on its lips, it is as 
though this book had managed to create for itself an historical 
perspective.<br><br>
That alone would suffice to make it a great book, but it 
contains much more than a vivid and precise description of the 
disaster of 1940. There is in the whole ‘Statement’, and 
particularly in the third chapter—in which a Frenchman examines his 
conscience—the shattering confession of a distinguished French 
intellectual who sets himself to examine in detail, and without 
mercy, a world and a caste. From that point on, the tone is 
that of a man meditating with fervour on others and on 
himself. Soldiers, politicians, civil servants, professors, workmen, 
peasants, all the social categories of the nation, pass beneath the 
microscope, and the author’s conclusions are summed up with 
a brevity worthy of a Vauvenargues. The whole work is 
conceived in the lapidary terms of the ‘Maxim’. Follow him in his 
explanation of the confusion, the terror, the ambition, and the 
courage of those days. Note the tranquil daring with which this 
man, himself the scion of the <i>bourgeois</i> aristocracy, never hesitates 
to find instinctively in the humble people of France the constant 
elements of humanity, freedom, and dignity. Marc Bloch fought 
in two wars, that of 1914 and that of 1939, and frequently 
compares them. Speaking of courage, he writes:
<blockquote>’... I have never come across better fighters than the miners of the 
Nord and the Pas de Calais whom I saw at close quarters in the first 
war. I found only one exception to this rule, and for a long time it 
puzzled me, until I discovered, quite by chance, that the man in 
question was a “scab”, by which I mean a non-unionist employed as a
<b>xi</b> strike-breaker. It is not a question of party politics. Quite simply, it 
comes to this, that where, in times of peace, class-loyalty is absent, 
the ability to put selfish interests last fails inevitably on the field of 
battle’</blockquote>

By merely reporting what he saw and heard, Captain Marc Bloch 
manages to paint of the High Command during the period of the 
‘phoney war’ a series of portraits which stand out, as we know 
only too well, with a harsh realism. But even while he criticizes, 
he can focus his gaze upon the present and the future and add 
his comments on methods and on tactics. In all this we see 
the moralist and the historian guessing and foreseeing with an 
astonishing ease of intellectual grasp. This ‘Statement of 
Evidence’ relative to our strange defeat, written in 1940, is at once 
an explanation, a warning, and a confident prophecy. Now, in 
our newly gained liberty, it takes on a noble beauty, the kind of 
grandeur which belongs to all narrations of fact intended for 
posterity. What, for instance, he wrote in July 1940 might well 
serve as a golden rule for our reformers of 1946:
<blockquote>’. . . Whatever the complexion of its government, a country is 
bound to suffer if the <i>instruments</i> of power are hostile to the spirit 
which obtains in the various branches of its public institutions. A 
monarchy needs a personnel composed of monarchists. A democracy 
becomes hopelessly weak, and the general good suffers accordingly, 
if its higher officials, bred up to despise it, and necessarily drawn from 
those very classes the dominance of which it is pledged to destroy, 
serve it only half-heartedly. . . .’</blockquote>
Finally, the whole of Marc Bloch, all the greatness of his French 
humanism, is in the following lines: 

<blockquote>’. . . How many employers of my acquaintance have I ever found 
capable of understanding, for instance, what nobility may lie behind a 
“sympathetic” strike—no matter how unreasonable ? “It isn’t”, they 
say, “as though the men were striking for their <i>own</i> wages.” There are 
two categories of Frenchmen who will never really grasp the 
significance of French history: those who refuse to thrill to the Consecration
<b>xii</b> of our Kings at Rheims, and those who can read unmoved the account 
of the Festival of Federation. . . .’<br><br></blockquote>

The final paragraphs of Marc Bloch’s ‘Statement* open with 
this sort of <i>largo</i> movement:<br><br>

<blockquote>’. . . The generation to which I belong has a bad conscience. . . .’</blockquote> 

I defy any Frenchman who is sensitive to the motions of the 
spirit to read this passage without feeling something of that 
emotion which moves us in the presence of perfect human 
dignity. One finds the same purity in the simple phrases in which 
Marc Bloch of the Resistance expressed his last wishes to his 
family in the event of his sudden death. As early as 1940 he had 
foreseen that he would have to take up arms again and embark 
on a new struggle, and a fresh adventure—the adventure of 
Civilian Resistance in the heart of occupied France:
<blockquote>’. . . My only hope, and I make no bones about it, is that when the 
moment comes we shall have enough blood left to shed, even though 
it be the blood of those who are dear to us (I say nothing of my 
own, to which I attach no importance). For there can be no 
salvation where there is not some sacrifice, and no national liberty in 
the fullest sense unless we have ourselves worked to bring it about. . . . ‘</blockquote> 

Marc Bloch was right, and right, too, in his summing up: 

<blockquote>’. . . Whatever form the final triumph may take, it will be many 
years before the stain of 1940 can be effaced.’</blockquote>
This ‘Statement’ of his is a light shining through the darkness.<br><br><br><br>

The intellectual leaders of the nation, the university world, 
those in France who care for the things of the mind and the 
imagination, all know, only too well, what they have lost in him.<br><br>

Each of Marc Bloch’s books, <i>Les Rois thaumaturges, Les 
Caractères originaux de l’histoire rurale française</i>, <i>La Société 
Féodale</i>, represented a discovery, stood for yet one more triumph 
of modern historical science over the past. His colleagues, his 
students, workers everywhere in the field of history, a vast 
public of chosen spirits in all the countries of the world, knew
<b>xiii</b> Marc Bloch as a thinker of infinite curiosity, as one of those 
writers who, more than others, had brought something new 
to historical research. France could be proud of him. ‘I 
remember’, says the British Professor Brogan, ‘I remember vividly the 
day on which the news of Marc Bloch’s death reached us in 
Cambridge, and how eagerly we pounced on the rumour— 
false, alas!—that he had escaped. When we learned beyond 
doubt that he was dead, we felt that a blow had been dealt to the 
whole world of learning.’ There can be no doubt that he was a 
great figure, or that his work will endure. Generations still to 
come of students, researchers, and scholars will find in it a rich 
harvest. <br><br>

When he joined the Resistance with us at Lyons I already 
knew him by reputation. What I did not know was that a man 
might, as he did, impart to his very life the same style as marked 
the movement of his spirit and intelligence.<br><br> 

<blockquote>. . . Dear Marc Bloch, dear ‘Narbonne’ in the Resistance. . . .</blockquote>
At the beginning of this ‘Statement* of his, speaking of the fact 
that he was a Jew, a fact about which he felt ‘neither pride nor 
shame’, he says:
<blockquote>’. . . that France, from which many would like to expel me to-day 
(and may, for all I know, succeed in doing so), will remain, whatever 
happens, the one country with which my deepest emotions are 
inextricably bound up. I was born in France. I have drunk of the waters of 
her culture. I have made her past my own. I breathe freely only in 
her climate, and I have done my best, with others, to defend her 
interests. ...’</blockquote> 

‘They’ never succeeded in expelling him from his native soil, 
from the spirit of France, or from the struggle she was waging. 
The most ‘they’ could do was to expel him from life. ... He 
offered his blood even before it was asked of him. And yet. . . <br><br>

For a long time we would not believe that the brutes had 
extinguished that light.<br><br> 

It was bad enough to know that he had been beaten, tortured;
<b>xiv</b> that the body of this slim man on which distinction sat with so 
natural an air, that this refined, moderate-minded, proud 
intellectual had been plunged into an ice-cold bath, and then, choking 
and shivering, had been struck, beaten, and outraged. <br><br>

We could not, literally could not, bear to contemplate the 
picture which this news conjured up: could not bear to think of 
Marc Bloch, that perfect type of French dignity, that fine 
example of a deep and exquisite humanism, in the hands of the 
Nazi beasts: could not endure the knowledge of that lovely 
spirit degraded to a mere thing of flesh in the vilest of vile 
hands. ... A few of us, his friends, his comrades in the secret 
battle, happened to be together at Lyons when we heard of his 
arrest. Somebody, all of a sudden, said: ‘They have tortured 
him.’ A fellow prisoner had seen him at Gestapo headquarters, 
bleeding from the mouth (a blood-stained gash in place of that 
mischievous smile which had been his last gift to me as we stood 
together at a street corner just before the horror had pounced!). 
I remember how, at those words, ‘he was bleeding’, tears of rage 
leapt to the eyes of all of us. Even the toughest bowed their 
heads, overwhelmed by the news, as men may do when injustice 
has exceeded all bounds. <br><br>

For months we had been waiting, hoping. Deported ?—no— 
still in the prison of Montluc at Lyons?—transferred to another 
city? We knew nothing until the day came when we were told, 
‘No hope now: he was shot at Trévoux on the 16th June, 1944. 
His clothes, his papers, were identified.’ They killed him along 
with a few others who had found strength in his courage. <br><br>

For it is known in what manner he died. A boy of sixteen 
was standing next to him, trembling. ‘Will it hurt?’ Marc Bloch 
took him affectionately by the arm, and merely said, ‘No, my 
boy: it won’t hurt at all.’ He was the first to fall, crying ‘Vive 
La France!’<br><br>

There is something in the phrasing of those last words that 
is at once familiar and sublime, something that belongs to the
<b>xv</b> simplicity of the great and antique world. To me it speaks of the 
serene integrity of a life which, from its deep, new delving into 
the past, unearthed the eternal values of the human spirit—of an 
active faith for which he knew how to die.<br><br><br><br> 

I can see again in memory that charming moment when 
twenty-year-old Maurice, the youngest of our underground 
‘group’, blushed with pleasure as he presented his ‘new recruit’, 
a gentleman of fifty, with a rosette in his buttonhole, a thin, 
refined face, silver-grey hair, and keen eyes behind a pair of 
spectacles. He was carrying a brief-case in one hand, a walking- 
stick in the other. At first his manners were a little stiff, but, 
after the first few seconds, he smiled, held out his hand, and said 
politely: ‘Yes, I’m Maurice’s “colt”. . . .’ It was thus, with a 
smile, that Professor Marc Bloch joined the Resistance. With 
a smile no different he was to leave it for the last time.<br><br> 

Very early on in our breathless, hunted, necessarily Bohemian 
existence, I was filled with admiration for the intense love of 
order and method which was our ‘dear Master’s’ gift to us. 
(That rather academic phrase seemed no less comic to him than 
it did to us. It was, so to speak, the relic of a past which, however 
real it had once been, seemed now so very far away from, so 
unconnected with, our daily preoccupations—rather as a top hat 
might have looked on a man armed with a tommy-gun.) The 
same ‘dear Master’ now turned with eagerness to absorb the 
rudiments of outlawry and rebellion. We soon grew accustomed 
to the spectacle of this Sorbonne professor sharing with us, 
outwardly unmoved, that life of the ‘pariah dog’ which was what 
the underground movement in our cities meant. <br><br>

I know that I am not running counter to his deepest feelings 
when I say that he loved danger, that he had, in Bossuet’s words, 
‘the soul of the fighter that rules the body of its possessor’. He 
had refused to accept the Armistice and Pétain. In the post where 
Destiny had placed him he carried on the battle. But in the
<b>xvi</b> hustle and bustle of our secret work he brought to our every 
meeting, our every council-of-war, to our duties, our rashness 
and our risks, a taste for precision, for detail, for logic which lay 
like a somewhat ridiculous piece of decoration on the surface of 
his calm courage, and which I, for my part, found enchanting.<br><br>

‘Come, come, we mustn’t let ourselves be carried away. The 
great thing is to isolate and <i>limit</i> the problem. . . .’—whether 
that problem was getting instructions through to the local 
leaders of the M.U.R. (<i>Mouvements Unis de Résistance</i>), to 
arrange for the transport of arms, to print some clandestine 
leaflet, or to make sure that the authorities of the ‘Underground’ 
knew precisely what to do on D-day....<br><br>

When, at some street corner, I saw Marc Bloch, his coat collar 
turned up against the cold, his walking-stick in his hand, ‘passing’ 
mysterious and compromising scraps of paper to young men in 
trappers’ coats or pullovers, as calmly as though he were handing 
back their essays to a lot of competitors in an examination, I used 
to tell myself—as I still do—that nobody who had not lived 
through those days could have the slightest idea what exaltation 
was to be found in the secret civilian Resistance of France.<br><br>

The Gestapo, the Militia, the Pétain Police, were beside 
themselves with fury. Each day one of our friends, as we said, ‘got it’. 
He would be there with us, and then, a moment later, gone, 
spirited away, swallowed up, as it were, in the abyss. There were 
always others to take his place. But how long the time seemed! 
Hope grew sick and weary. Victory and the end of the 
nightmare were so far off! But still the <i>maquis</i> fought, still the secret 
presses printed, and the deep, relentless voice of the Resistance 
could be heard behind and above everything. There were 
searches, arrests, bursts of firing in the streets, tortures, 
shootings. . . . How lonely we felt sometimes seeing all around us 
apathy, acquiescence—and hideous examples of collaboration.<br><br>

Very soon Marc Bloch was known to the whole Resistance 
movement—known far too well. He saw, insisted on seeing,
<b>xvii</b> too many people. He had carried over from the days of his law- 
abiding life as a university professor the conviction that no one 
else can do one’s work for one. He wanted to do as much as he 
possibly could himself. He had a passion for organization. He 
was quite rightly obsessed by the need to see that every wheel 
was turning smoothly in the whole .vast and complicated 
machine by means of which the M.U.R. issued instructions to 
the <i>maquis</i>, the <i>francs-tireurs</i>, the propaganda services, the Press, 
and arranged for acts of sabotage, for attacks on the Occupying 
Power, for the struggle against the deportation of workers. His 
was a fighter’s, not a soldier’s temperament—not a soldier’s, I 
mean, in the professional sense. In the ‘14 war’, he used to 
say jokingly, ‘I never managed to get promotion. D’you realize 
that I am the <i>oldest</i> Captain in the whole of the French Army?’ <br><br>

He had, like all of us, to conceal his identity beneath a double, 
a triple, a quadruple alibi: one for his false papers, one for use 
among his colleagues, one for signing letters. What induced 
him, in the early days, to use the odd pseudonym of ‘Arpajon’? 
I think it amused him to conjure up the thought of that small 
suburban town, and the picturesque steam train which in those 
days puffed its way nightly from the Central Markets through 
the Quartier Latin—<i>his</i> Quartier, with its schools and colleges. 
When ‘they’—as we said—’got wise’ to the name, he decided to 
remain loyal to the same railway system, and changed to ‘Che- 
vreuse’. But they ‘got wise’ to Chevreuse too, and we thought it 
wiser for him to get out of the île de France for good and all. 
So he became ‘Narbonne’ It was as Narbonne that he served 
as delegate of the <i>franc-tireur</i> group to the regional committee 
of the M.U.R. at Lyons. It was as Narbonne that, in company 
with the Delegates of’Combat’ and ‘Liberation’, he was to direct 
the whole of the Lyons Resistance until that tragic day when the 
trap closed and he was dragged away to execution.<br><br>
‘Narbonne’ he was for the Resistance, but for the landlords of 
the houses where he lodged, Monsieur Blanchard. It was under
<b>xviii</b> that name that he did his travelling, made journeys, for instance, 
to Paris, for the meetings of the C.G.E. (<i>Comité Générale d’Études 
de la Résistance</i>). There was an element of ‘sport’ about the 
zest with which he accepted the risks and outlawry of his new 
life. There was a youthfulness, an air of physical fitness, about 
him at which I never ceased to wonder when I used to see him 
run to catch the tram which took him back to his Lyons lodgings 
up behind the Croix-Rousse—a chance find, the principal feature 
of which was a kitchen-range which came in very useful when, at 
regular intervals, he set about burning his excessive accumulation 
of papers.<br><br>
I often used to fetch him from the quiet, countrified rue de 
TOrangerie at Cuire. It was arranged between us that I should 
never go upstairs, but should stand in the street and whistle a 
few bars of Beethoven or Wagner to bring him down—usually 
the first bars of the <i>Ride of the Valkyries</i>. He would run 
downstairs with a grin on his face, and never failed to say: ‘Not bad, 
Chabot: but never quite in tune, you know. . . .’<br><br>
Imagine this man, made for the silence of creative work, for 
the studious calm of a book-filled library, hurrying from street 
to street, helping us to decipher the Resistance dispatches in the 
attic of some old Lyons house. . . . <br><br>

And then came catastrophe. After trying for a whole year, the 
Gestapo managed at last to lay hands on part of the M.U.R. 
headquarters staff. Marc Bloch was arrested, tortured, 
imprisoned. I have already described the wonderful way in which 
he met his end.... <br><br>
On 26 June 1944 twenty-seven corpses were dug up at 
Saint-Didier-sur-Formont, near Lyons. Some friends managed 
to get hold of the police photographs. We studied them 
anxiously. The face of an old man with a ten days’ growth of 
white beard, a scrap of clothing marked with the initials M.B., 
a set of false papers in the name of Maurice Blanchard. . . . Yes, 
it was Marc Bloch right enough.<br><br>
<b>xvix</b> ‘If I get out of this alive, I shall go back to my teaching’—he 
frequently used to say.<br><br>

He was passionately devoted to his chosen work. He dreamed 
of wide-spreading educational reforms of which he published 
the general lines in the clandestine review called <i>Les Cahiers 
politiques</i>. He adored his family: his brave, sweet wife who died 
suddenly while he was confined at Montluc, and his six children 
—Alice, Etienne, Louis, Daniel, Jean-Paul, Suzanne. . . . <br><br>

I have rarely known any man whose intelligence and heart 
and bearing were marked by so natural an air of distinction. 
Spontaneously he measured all things by the standards of human 
values and spiritual truth. What he felt in those days of constant 
alarms and activity, of being pursued and having to get away at 
a moment’s notice, of outlawry and conspiracy, was the need 
not, as the phrase is, to ‘escape’, but to return to the true mental 
atmosphere of the life he loved, the life of thought and art. <br><br>

I remember one night of full moon on the Croix-Rousse. 
I was walking back with Marc Bloch to his remote hide-out. 
So unoppressive did the darkness seem, so far removed from the 
stifling drama of our lives, that the fancy took him to talk of 
music and of poetry—not in order to forget the risks and the 
horror, but so that he might evoke something of the fine 
discipline of the mind, of the gentle beauties now profaned, banished, 
and temporarily eclipsed, which alone justify the life of human 
beings, and for which he, Marc Bloch, was fighting. <br><br>

He always had a book in his hand when he was out on duty. 
He used it not only for reading but for jotting down the details 
of secret meetings in a mysterious system of cryptograms which 
was his peculiar pride. But he was careful to choose his authors 
carefully so as not to waste his time. <br><br>

The last I saw him carrying were a Ronsard... and a collection 
of French medieval folk-songs. <br><br>

<center><b>PRESENTATION OF THE WITNESS</b></center><br><br>

WILL these pages ever be published?—I cannot tell. 
But whatever the eventual answer to that question may 
be, it seems probable that, for a long time to come, 
those outside the circle of my immediate intimates will be able 
to read them only ‘under the rose’. Nevertheless, I have quite 
made up my mind to proceed with the writing of them, though 
the effort involved will be harsh and exacting. How much easier 
it would be to plead weariness and discouragement as an excuse 
for doing nothing! But if the kind of documentation that I plan 
is to have any value, it must be put into shape at once while the 
subject is still fresh and living in my memory. Nor can I really 
persuade myself that the effort will be wholly useless. A day will 
come, of that I am convinced, after no matter how long a delay, 
when this old and sacred soil of France, from which, in the past, 
so many harvests have been lifted—harvests of free thought and 
of judgement unrestrained—will once more burgeon into 
ripeness. In that happier future many secret records will be made 
public. Gradually the mists of ignorance and malice, which now 
begin to gather about the most terrible collapse in all the long 
story of our national life, will thin. It may be that then, those on 
whom the duty falls of seeing through them to the truth beyond 
will be helped in their task by glancing at the pages (should they 
come their way) in which an eyewitness has set down the events 
of the year 1940, just as he experienced them.<br><br><br><br> 

It is no part of my intention to produce a book of 
reminiscences. The account of what happened to one soldier among 
many is of no especial interest now when we are concerned with 
matters of greater moment than the details of personal adventure, <b>2</b> however picturesque, however amusing, these may have been. 
But it is always well to have a full description of the witness in 
the box, and I feel that before narrating the things I saw I should 
give some account of the man who saw them.<br><br>

For something like thirty-four years I have been wholly 
occupied with the writing and the teaching of history. In the 
course of my professional career I have had to examine a great 
many documents belonging to a great many periods of the past, 
and, as best I might, sift what is true in them from what is false. 
I have had, too, to keep a watchful eye on the world around me, 
holding it to be the historian’s prime duty—in the words of my 
master, Pirenne—’to show a keen interest in life’. The special 
study which, in the course of my researches, I have made of the 
life of the country-side has convinced me that we can truly 
understand the past only if we read it by the light of the present. 
For a sound historian of rural economy a keen eye for the shapes 
of fields is no less necessary than an aptitude for deciphering the 
crabbed records of an earlier day. I have done my best to bring 
to the tragic events in which I played a modest part the same habits 
of criticism, of observation, and, I trust, of integrity, which were 
bred in me by the exigencies of my work as an historian.<br><br>
My chosen calling is generally considered to be peculiarly 
lacking in adventure. But Destiny decided that I, with most of 
my generation, should, on two separate occasions, separated 
from one another by a stretch of twenty-one years, be jerked 
violently from the ways of peace. Whatever other results this 
breach of the normal routine of teaching may have had, it 
certainly made it possible for me to enjoy an unusually wide 
experience of the many different aspects of a nation in arms. I 
have served in two wars. I began the first, in August 1914, as an 
infantry sergeant: in other words, as an ordinary ‘foot-slogger’, 
only just above the level of a private. In the course of the next 
four years I became successively a Platoon Commander, an 
Intelligence Officer, an A.D.C. at Regimental Headquarters, and 
<b>3</b> finished up as a Captain on a Corps Staff. My second experience 
as a soldier was, for the most part, gained at the very opposite 
end of the hierarchic scale. My duties confined me to the 
immediate entourage of an army commander, and involved me in 
constant liaison with G.H.Q. The fall of the cards has brought me 
plenty of variety, and has introduced me to a cross-section not 
only of the Army but of humanity in general.<br><br>

By birth I am a Jew, though not by religion, for I have never 
professed any creed, whether Hebrew or Christian. I feel neither 
pride nor shame in my origins. I am, I hope, a sufficiently good 
historian to know that racial qualities are a myth, and that the 
whole notion of Race is an absurdity which becomes particularly 
flagrant when attempts are made to apply it, as in this particular 
case of the Jews, to a group of co-religionists originally brought 
together from every corner of the Mediterranean, Turco-Khazar, 
and Slav worlds. I am at pains never to stress my heredity save 
when I find myself in the presence of an anti-Semite. But it may 
be that certain persons will challenge, the evidence which I 
propose to put on record, and attempt to discredit it on the grounds 
that I am an ‘alien’. I need say no more in rebuttal of such a 
charge than that my great-grandfather was a serving soldier in 
1793; that my father was one of the defenders of Strasbourg in 
1870; that both my uncles chose to leave their native Alsace after 
its annexation by the Second Reich; that I was brought up in the 
traditions of patriotism which found no more fervent champions 
than the Jews of the Alsatian exodus, and that France, from 
which many would like to expel me to-day (and may, for all I 
know, succeed in doing so), will remain, whatever happens, the 
one country with which my deepest emotions are inextricably 
bound up. I was born in France. I have drunk of the waters of 
her culture. I have made her past my own. I breathe freely only 
in her climate, and I have done my best, with others, to defend 
her interests.<br><br>
One day when I stood chatting with a young officer in a 
<b>4</b> doorway at Malo-les-Bains, during a bombing raid, he said to me: 
‘This war has taught me a lot, and one of its greatest lessons has 
been that there are a great many professional soldiers who will 
never be fighters, and a whole heap of civilians who have 
fighting in their blood. That’, he went on, ‘is a truth I should never 
have suspected before the 10th of May. You, for instance, are 
a born fighter.’ The judgement may appear to be rather over- 
simple, but I believe it to contain a good deal of truth, both as a 
generalization, and (to be perfectly sincere) when applied to my 
own particular case. An army doctor whom I knew when I was 
on the staff as an intelligence officer loved to twit me in a kindly 
way about being an ‘old professor’ who had ‘more of the soldier 
in him than all the rest of the bunch put together’—which meant 
merely, I imagine, that I had a weakness for orderliness in the 
handling of military matters. I emerged from the first war with 
four decorations, and I do not think I flatter myself unduly when 
I say that but for the sudden irruption of the Germans into 
Rennes, which put a sudden stop to all recommendations from 
the First Army, I could hardly have avoided going home after 
this one, too, with another ribbon on my tunic.[1] In 1915, after 
convalescing in hospital, I returned to the front before I need 
have done, as a volunteer. In 1939 I allowed my name to be kept 
on the active list in spite of the fact that my age and my six 
children gave me a perfect right to put my uniform away in 
mothballs. I mention these things not from any motive of 
vainglory. I have known far too many brave and humble men who 
did their duty without fuss or bother (far better than I could ever 
claim to have done mine), to be guilty of the sin of boasting. I 
put them on record here simply and solely as a form of self- 
protection against criticism. At times I may be rather crudely 
outspoken, and the reader may be tempted to accuse me of 
prejudice. To him I would say that I have always been an enemy to 
soft-soap, that I served of my own free will as a soldier, and that 
<b>5</b> in the opinion of seniors and comrades alike I did a reasonably 
good job.<br><br>

That is a bald statement of what I was expected to do, and, 
consequently, of what I was in a position to see, in the course of 
the last war.<br><br> 

In the period between the two wars I more than once refused, 
as I have already said, to take advantage of a regulation which 
would have enabled me to escape from further military service. 
But though from 1919 onwards I figured as a Reserve Officer 
eligible for staff duties, I made no attempt to attend any of the so- 
called ‘refresher’ courses. This, generally speaking, I admit was 
wrong. The only excuse I can plead is that the years in question 
happened to coincide with the period of my life during which, 
for good or for ill, I was producing the bulk of my serious 
historical work, and that therefore I had very little leisure. I 
derive, however, a certain amount of consolation for my failure 
from my active experiences during the campaign. I feel quite 
sure that the kind of training given at the Staff College which I 
was thus spared would have done nothing to fit me for my duties. 
But since, at that time, the military authorities attached particular 
importance to graduating with distinction from that 
establishment, I was made to suffer for having played truant. I received, 
in fact, a double punishment. In 1918 I had attained the rank of 
captain, and it was as a captain, therefore, that I was called up 
first in 1938, and again in August 1939, in spite of being 
recommended for promotion by senior officers who had had occasion 
to see something of my work. A captain I remained until I was 
demobilized on 11 July 1940. That was the first consequence of 
my slackness. It left me without any feeling of resentment or 
even of sorrow. The second related to the nature of the duties I 
was called upon to perform. <br><br>

I had originally been attached, on paper, to Intelligence at 
Corps level. It seemed a reasonable form of employment for a 
professional historian. I was, however, almost immediately 
<b>6</b> degraded to a similar position with a division. Soon afterwards 
I was withdrawn altogether from duty with an active formation, 
and relegated to the rather inglorious job of area administration, 
being attached to a headquarters controlling a group of sub- 
divisional areas. Since, however, this particular group was based 
on Strasbourg, which was generally expected to be one of the 
first targets for German bombing, I felt some qualms about 
agitating for a transfer. A natural laziness combined with this 
feeling to prevent me from taking any steps to find more 
interesting employment. One of my friends had tried, even before the 
war, to get me attached to G.H.Q. Intelligence, but there had 
not been sufficient time for his representations to produce results. 
Consequently, after two short periods of preliminary training, 
I was appointed to the Strasbourg Group of subdivisional areas, 
first in September 1938 at the time of the Munich crisis, again, 
for a few hours only, when in March 1939 I was hastily 
summoned from Cambridge, and finally on 24 August in that same 
year of destiny.<br><br>

By and large I have never really regretted this appointment. 
The duties devolving upon a subdivisional Group Headquarters 
are, in themselves, flat and dismal enough, but they do, in the 
early stages of hostilities, afford one a good vantage-point from 
which to observe the general scene. That, at least, was my 
experience during the first two or three weeks.<br><br> 

We had to supervise a good deal of the actual mobilization. 
What happened in similar commands situated farther back? I 
imagine that, after the first excitement was over, they managed 
to keep pretty busy with paper-work and details. My own, which 
soon moved from Strasbourg to Molsheim in the foothills of the 
Vosges, was very much in the thick of things. When, at long 
last and extraordinarily slowly, the Sixth Army got its own 
organization going, our rôle, which had already been 
progressively whittled down, was reduced almost to zero. There followed 
an interminable succession of days when, seemingly, nothing 
<b>7</b> ever got done. Our little party consisted of five persons: a 
general of brigade, a lieutenant-colonel, two captains, and a 
lieutenant. We used to spend the time sitting in the schoolroom 
which formed our office (I can still see the scene vividly in 
memory), longing for a runner to arrive unexpectedly with some 
official form which would provide us with an excuse for filling 
up still further forms. The most contented of the lot was the 
younger of the two captains, whose duty it was to issue passes! 
An historian is not often bored. He always has the resources of 
memory, observation, and writing to keep him busy. But the 
feeling that one is serving no useful purpose in a nation at war is 
intolerable.<br><br>

Our general was a reservist, a thoroughly good fellow who 
was eventually sent home to pursue his studies. These, for the 
most part, took the form of fly-fishing. What remained of his 
staff was merged with the subdivisional area group based on 
Saverne. I spent only two days in that agreeable though definitely 
overcrowded little town. I had managed to make contact with 
a high-ranking officer at G.H.Q. Wire-pulling with the object 
of landing a better job is not an activity in which one naturally 
takes much pride, but it was scarcely my fault that only thus 
could I find any useful outlet for my enthusiasm. Thanks to my 
influential friend, I was transferred early in October to H.Q., 
First Army, and reported, without losing a moment, at Bohain 
in Picardy.<br><br>
G.H.Q. had made it quite clear what my function was to be. 
I was to act as liaison officer with the British, and, as such, was 
attached to the Intelligence Branch. But I had been there only a 
short time when two other officers turned up with precisely 
similar instructions. The Chief of Staff, embarrassed by a 
superfluity of riches, decided that each main formation of the Army 
should have its own organ of contact with the Expeditionary 
Force. He therefore divided us up among the various 
administrative branches—omitting only ‘A’, which, being concerned with 
<b>8</b> matters of personnel and discipline, has no need of links with the 
outside world. I found myself attached to ‘Q’—that is to say, 
to the office in charge of transport, labour-supply, and rations, 
though my job was very much what it had previously been, a 
combination of Intelligence and Diplomacy. I shall explain later 
on how, most unfortunately, and certainly against my will, it 
lost, in fact, any significance it may once have had.<br><br> 
I began to wonder whether I was fated to drop back into that 
lazy existence of which I had once already been a victim. I was 
feeling thoroughly lost and dispirited when it happened that the 
officer in charge of petrol-supplies was moved elsewhere and I 
inherited his duties.<br><br> 

Almost overnight I had become the mighty Fuel King of the 
most heavily motorized army on the whole of the French front. 
My first reaction was one of sheer panic. I realized only too well 
that, in the event of active operations, I should have to shoulder 
the most appalling responsibilities. I did not know the first thing 
about the subject. Tray God’, I wrote to my wife, ‘that Hitler 
decides to go slow for a week or two!’ There are, however, few 
administrative posts that the ordinary intelligent man cannot 
tackle reasonably well, provided he gives his mind to the job. 
I did my very best to learn everything I could about what would 
be expected of me, and was blessed at the outset by a piece of 
real good luck. I found at the Army lorry park the wisest and 
most un-self-regarding counsellor that any man in my position 
could have wished for. This is the first time I have had occasion 
to mention the name of Captain Lachamp: it will certainly not 
be the last. The bitter aftertaste left in my mouth by the memory 
of this bungled and tragic war makes me the more inclined to 
cherish the few bright spots which it could show. It is always a 
delight to meet a man who really is a man. There can be no 
greater reward than to work with such a colleague in perfect 
harmony, and to feel the day-to-day sharing of one’s problems 
blossoming into a genuine and solid friendship.<br><br>
<b>9</b> Truth to tell, my new functions, once I had learned my way 
about, demanded little in the way of hard work. The period of 
apprenticeship once over, I slipped back, like everybody else, 
into the unexciting existence of the military bureaucrat. Not 
that I was ever left to kick my heels, but I was certainly never 
hag-ridden by my work, and the amount of stimulus that I 
received from the daily routine was small. Fortunately, I was 
able, for some weeks, to combine with it an additional task which 
I undertook quite voluntarily. It came to my notice that the 
information at our disposition about petrol dumps situated on 
Belgian territory was absurdly insufficient. This lack of accurate 
knowledge was particularly serious in view of the well-known 
fact that, once the Germans had violated the frontier, we should 
be called upon to move into Belgium. Certain personal contacts 
made it possible for me to add considerably to the headquarters 
file on this subject. A good deal of rather ticklish negotiating had 
to be done, and here my experience of the ways and mentality 
of staff officers served me in good stead. In particular I learned 
the very special way in which the bureaucrat who has a 
reasonable dose of good manners can interpret the phrase ‘meddling in 
what doesn’t concern one’. By and large, the inquiry which I set 
on foot, valuable though it may have turned out to be, did not 
really fall within my competence. My conduct in the matter was 
what is sometimes called (with a discreet smile) ‘dynamic’.<br><br>
This occupation, however, lasted only a short while, and once 
the goal at which I aimed had been reached, I was reduced to a 
daily grind which consisted in counting petrol-tins and rationing 
every drop of fuel issued. It was natural, therefore, though 
perhaps foolish, that I should once again sink into a mood of 
despondency and feel that what intellectual powers and gifts of 
initiative I might have were not being employed to the best 
advantage. The tedium of those long winter and spring months 
of 1939-40 wore down the resistance of a great many intelligent 
men. I was, I suppose, like many others, the victim of a peculiarly 
<b>10</b> subtle form of poisoning. Be that as it may, I quite seriously 
thought of asking, once the summer was over, for permission to 
resume my labours at the Sorbonne. But before I could take any 
step in the matter, the storm of 10 May burst over our heads.<br><br>
How unexpected it was can best be shown by mentioning 
something quite trivial that happened to me personally. I had 
gone to Paris on the 9th, with the object of proceeding to Meaux 
early the next morning, in order to get from G.H.Q. Transport 
a supply of the petrol-coupons by means of which I kept a check 
on the fuel consumption of my various units. I arrived at Meaux 
in complete ignorance of what had happened the previous night. 
The gentlemen at G.H.Q. showed no little surprise at the sudden 
apparition of an officer who had made a special journey, for so 
very unwarlike a purpose, from one of the armies on the Belgian 
frontier! After a few moments spent in talking at cross-purposes, 
I realized why it was that I had been so coldly received. I had 
just time to make the station, cross Paris, fight my way on to an 
incredibly overcrowded train, and so get back to my battle-post.<br><br><br><br>

I have promised myself not to describe in detail the three 
weeks that followed. I shall have occasion, later, to set down the 
lessons of what then occurred. A few scenes, chosen from among 
the crowd that presses on my memory, will suffice to mark the 
progress of a series of days and nights crammed with the incidents 
of that tragic campaign of the Nord.<br><br>

Let me begin by making mention of the girls’ school at 
Valenciennes which we planned to occupy temporarily before 
moving on to an Advanced H.Q. in Belgium which had been 
chosen on the assumption that we should be engaged in open 
warfare, though, in fact, it was never used. It was our first 
experience at close range of the ruin caused by the German 
preliminary bombing attack.<br><br>
On two occasions I was able to slip away on trips into Belgium. 
They suited that nomadic instinct in me of which my superiors 
<b>11</b> did not always approve. On the i ith I got no farther than Mons, 
but on the 12th I pushed forward in the direction of Nivelles, 
Fleurus, and Charleroi. All along the road we saw miners 
enjoying the temporary leisure of the Easter holiday. They were 
standing at the doors of their houses to give a welcome to the 
French motorized columns. The gently rolling country-side 
round Ligny and Quatre-Bras, where once Ney’s army had 
fought, decked in the green of early spring, presented a 
charming scene. But already the sides of the thoroughfare were chock- 
a-block with long lines of civilians making their way back from 
the districts round Liège. They trudged along, pushing the now 
almost traditional children’s prams piled high with every variety 
of ill-assorted baggage. A sprinkling of disbanded Belgian 
soldiers from the villages through which they had passed was 
symptomatic of a more alarming state of affairs. Anxiety began 
to press hard on the heels of an earlier optimism. Word went 
round that the passages of the Meuse had been forced. An effort 
had been made to get supplies up to the divisions which had been 
hastily rushed in,to action, almost immediately to lose all cohesion 
and vanish, so it seemed, into thin air. Ultimately, our Army 
withdrew towards the south-west and, on the 18th, H.Q. was 
moved back to Douai.<br><br>
For rather less than two days we occupied yet another school 
in the suburbs of that town. Having already enjoyed the 
hospitality of a girls’ school at Bohain, we felt that educational 
establishments were to be our fate. All around us bombs were 
showering down on the station, the main roads, and the 
aerodromes. Almost every day news came in that yet another 
‘back-area’ fuel dump had fallen into German hands. The fine 
containers which we had constructed at Saint-Quentin and 
Cambrai, and were holding jealously in reserve in order to 
ensure a continuous flow of petrol to the front, the ‘dispersed’ 
depots of which we had been so proud, where the tins were 
cleverly camouflaged under the trees of public parks or in the 
<b>12</b> lean-tos of abandoned brickfields, could no longer be relied 
upon to supply the needs of our formations. After the shortest 
of delays we had to pack up once again and resume our trek. It 
had been at first arranged that I should be left behind with two 
assistants at Advanced H.Q., Douai. But that plan, like so many 
others, had to be revised a few hours later. Picking my way 
across the blackened country-side, through a maze of slag-heaps, 
most of which had collapsed grotesquely under the effect of 
bombing, and had already lost their pristine clarity of outline, 
I reached the fourth—and last—school, at Lens, which we were 
destined to occupy (19 May).<br><br>

This time it was a nursery school. The furniture had been 
designed to fit the requirements of very young children, with 
the result that we were faced with a choice between two kinds of 
physical distress. Either we could remain standing indefinitely— 
an exhausting process—or we could squat on seats that were far 
too narrow for our mature figures, and at the imminent risk of 
skinning our knees against the undersides of the desks. Not that 
one was always in a position to choose. One might be forced 
into a sitting posture by the necessity of scribbling an urgent 
message, but then, how in the world was one to get up again? 
To extricate oneself from the seat of tribulation demanded 
strenuous and prolonged effort. This curious form of ordeal, 
the ugliness of the landscape, the filthy coal-dust that filtered 
incessantly through every crack and cranny—everything about 
the gloomy spot seemed to make a fitting background to our 
growing mood of depression. As a Battle H.Q., this educational 
set-up at Lens was sheer hell, a fitting preliminary to defeat. 
Shall I ever, I wonder, forget that evening of 20 May? Just as it 
was getting dusk, with the flames of Arras lighting the distant 
horizon, my immediate superior came into the room. In a very 
low voice, and pointing on a school wall-map to the mouth of 
the Somme, he said: The Boches are <i>there</i>!—then, turning 
away, he murmured, ‘Don’t talk about it more than you can 
<b>13</b> help.’ I had been trying to get G.H.Q. on the telephone, and it 
was only after I had made the attempt several times and failed, 
that I realized to the full the sense of complete abandonment 
that comes to a soldier when he hears the word—’surrounded’.<br><br>
A little later (22 May) we migrated northwards, and fetched 
up at Estaires-sur-Lys. But this, being a traffic-centre, was not a 
very healthy spot. German pilots did not often make a dead set 
at buildings occupied by H.Q. staffs, but it was too much to 
expect that we should not occasionally be hit. On the very first 
afternoon of our being there, a bomb fell near enough to shake 
the walls and chimney of the inn where we had established our 
office. The burst was sufficiently close to cover our clothes, 
papers, and faces with an indescribably filthy contribution of 
soot. The warning was not ignored. I had just turned in, and 
was enjoying the luxury of sheets for the first time for many 
days (for the last, too, it turned out, during the campaign) when 
a movement-order dragged me from my bed in the middle of 
the night. As a matter of fact we did not get off until well after 
dawn. The authorities always showed a curious inability to 
organize that most necessary of all things—rest. In the course of 
the following morning, after making a long detour which, as 
usual, involved a severe dislocation of my fuel supplies, I reached 
the Château of Attiches, south of Lille, whither I had been 
preceded by the rest of the staff (23 May).<br><br>
The château stood in a fine stretch of park-land. It was a 
graceless building adorned on the outside with a repellent 
arrangement of ‘artistic’ tiles, and filled with the kind of luxurious, 
gloomy, and vaguely medieval furniture which the rich middle- 
class families of the later nineteenth century regarded as the 
necessary background to a bogus territorial grandeur. In one 
corner of the dining-room, where we worked, the owner, with 
what we could not but consider rather premature consideration, 
had erected a pile of mortuary wreaths. It was here, on the 
afternoon of the 23rd, that our ‘Q’ branch finally split into two 
<b>14</b> sections. One of these was to form our rear organization, and 
at once proceeded to the coast, there to arrange a system of 
seaborne communications. The other—to which I was attached— 
stayed where it was with the army commander. As things turned 
out, the former, though at a much greater distance from the 
front, was to come in for the worst of the bombing—an irony of 
fate which nobody at the time had, I suspect, foreseen. In the 
innocence of our hearts, we of the forward elements fully expected 
to be the chosen target for air-attack (bombs did, indeed, fall 
continuously all round us) and were quite prepared to find 
ourselves exposed to the imminent danger of capture. Since, too, 
rear H.Q. contained, in addition to several men whose courage 
was beyond question, a fair sprinkling of those who were not 
averse to putting a few miles between themselves and the battle- 
front, we of the front line had a feeling that we formed a rather 
special body of the elect, imbued with the spirit of comradeship 
and mutual assistance. So strong was this prejudice that one of 
my companions, a plain lieutenant of reserve who, in civil life, 
was President of a Chamber of Commerce in the Nord 
Department, having been told to report for duty to the coast, obstinately 
refused to budge. The second-in-command of our section, who, 
in a way not calculated to improve morale, had ignored the 
generally accepted military tradition in these matters, and moved 
back with his immediate superior, took in very ill part an attitude 
so clearly at variance with his own. White with anger, he haled 
the disobedient underling before the highest disciplinary authority 
available, only to find, to his great surprise, that this courageous 
refusal to obey orders was by no means frowned upon.<br><br>
Another scene is associated in my memory with that dining- 
room at Attiches. It had to do with one of the most degrading 
spectacles of human weakness that it has ever been my lot to 
witness. As the morning wore on we became aware of the figure 
of a man slumped in a chair close to the door. Dull-eyed and 
gloomy, he sat there chewing innumerable cigarettes. He wore 
<b>15</b> no badges of rank on his sleeve, and the personnel of the office 
pushed past him with no more consideration than they would 
have accorded to the lowest orderly. He was, in fact, a general 
of division who had been deprived of his command a few hours 
previously—for drunkenness, it was said, though with what 
justice I do not know. He was waiting to have a final interview 
with the army commander. This he obtained, after considerable 
delay, about noon. It lasted only a few minutes, and that was the 
last we saw of our depressing visitor.<br><br>
On the 26th we moved into what was to be our last 
headquarters, a gay little villa, furnished with refinement, situated at 
Steenwerck, to the north-west of Lille. The house next door was 
occupied by General Prioux. He had just taken over command 
of the Army from General Blanchard. The latter had been 
transferred to the Army Group, thereby escaping the immediate 
consequences of the disaster. Enemy pressure was becoming 
more and more accentuated, and we were faced by the imminent 
necessity of burning our important reserve fuel dumps at Lille. 
I spent the whole of the 27th and the night following in an 
attempt to get a decision on this point. No less than four 
separate orders were issued, and no less than four times were 
they countermanded. The last of them was within an ace of 
never being carried out. I dispatched a messenger on a 
motorbike after dark, but he never arrived. What happened to him I 
do not know. My conscience, however, was clear. I had to see 
that the order reached its destination. Had I taken it myself I 
should have been guilty of dereliction of duty. Still, it was only 
natural that I should feel some slight pang at the thought that, 
quite possibly, I had sent a brave man to his death. A number of 
similar incidents remained in my memory from the last war. For 
a while they had had a way of haunting me when I could not 
sleep, though eventually I became callous. Fortunately, on this 
occasion I was able to get a second message through, and the 
dump went up just in time. But only just in time, for the Army 
<b>16</b> had already begun a withdrawal behind the line of the Lys, 
preparatory to a general movement seawards. Not the whole of 
the Army, however, was involved. On the evening of the 28th, 
General Prioux made it known to us that he despaired of being 
able to disengage two, and possibly more, of his divisions. 
Consequently, he had decided to remain in person at Steenwerck, 
there to await the coming of the enemy. It was his intention to 
keep with him only one or two officers. The rest of us, he said, 
had better make for the coast under cover of darkness, and get on 
board what ships we could find. A little later I went to see him in 
order to get a confirmation of the order that I was to empty, 
render useless, and abandon my mobile tanks. This meant 
depriving the Army of its last few remaining gallons of petrol, 
and I felt that I could not take it upon myself to make so grave 
a decision, though it was a logical result of the situation as it was 
at that time developing. Our great-hearted leader was sadly 
pacing the hall of the house in which he had his quarters. His 
had been a melancholy fate if ever there was one. Seconded from 
the Cavalry Corps which, so I am told, he had commanded with 
distinction, he was sent at the eleventh hour to take over an 
army already in a state of disintegration, and had to accept a 
captivity which he had ill deserved in place of the man who was 
really responsible for the defeat.<br><br>
That duty done, I returned to our villa. In the course of the 
day I had already, acting on instructions, burned all our records, 
including the note-book in which I had kept a day-to-day diary 
of my own adventures. I would give a great deal to have that 
green-bound volume by me now. I also committed all my 
personal correspondence to the mess stove—for we had been 
forbidden to load ourselves with unnecessary baggage—and 
made what room I could in my haversack for a few especially 
precious or useful objects. As it was, I forgot about three- 
quarters of them, though I was at least able to change my working 
tunic for something in a rather better state of repair. In this I 
<b>17</b>was more fortunate than the general commanding the Army 
artillery. This fine soldier who, from a perhaps excessive scruple 
of honour, had decided to remain with General Prioux, was 
separated from all his belongings, which had been sent, rather 
prematurely, to Dunkirk. He had only the clothes he stood up 
in, and there was a hole in the elbow of his tunic. This 
misfortune made him voluble. He could face the prospect of 
captivity calmly enough—but not of captivity in rags!<br><br>
We left that night: a long, slow column of cars moving across 
the Belgian country-side, for the French roads were already cut. 
By first light we had covered barely ten kilometres. How had 
we managed to evade the enemy’s motorized scouts? To this 
day I do not really know. The fact remains that, sometimes on 
foot, sometimes on wheels, I reached Hondschoote round about 
noon. But I still had to make the coast. Together with Captain 
Lachamp, whom I found there on my arrival, I set about 
discovering the main fuel column which had started ahead of us 
with instructions to rendezvous at Bray-les-Dunes. We drove 
along the roads to Furnes, but were brought up short, first by 
blown bridges, and then, on the main thoroughfare, by an 
incredible jam of lorries which were halted head to tail and three 
deep. In rear of this obstruction was a tank officer loudly 
announcing that he was on special duty and must be got through. 
For over an hour we worked hard to open even the narrowest of 
lanes. A general of division, whom we met by accident, wanted 
to know what I was doing there. Duly informed, he turned to 
with a will, and did, I must confess, a fine job. Our efforts were 
at last crowned with success. But it was too late for us to continue 
our journey. Even had we done so, what guarantee was there 
that we should not run into some other obstacle farther on? 
There was nothing for it but to beat a crestfallen retreat to 
Hondschoote.<br><br>
We set out again at nightfall, this time on foot, and taking a 
more direct route. A pedestrian could scramble through where 
<b>18</b> a lorry would have been forced to a standstill. It was a hideous 
experience—or, at least, the last ten kilometres of the journey 
were. We had to make our way through an extraordinary 
confusion of motor traffic in a darkness that every minute was 
becoming more dense. The column was at Bray, right enough, 
and I was offered the hospitality of an empty house. Even a 
drink was forthcoming. Unfortunately—as the surgeons at the 
Zuydschoote hospital near by had only too good reason to know— 
the whole of the coastal district, bounded on the inland side by 
marshes and polders into which the salt had infiltrated, was 
almost completely without water, owing to the canals having 
been cut. We had nothing but champagne with which to quench 
our thirst. How gladly would I have exchanged mine for a 
chance of gulping my fill on the bank of some cool, clear 
river!<br><br>
The Army, as such, having ceased to exist, I had no staff duties 
to perform. But I still had a ‘cure of souls’. True, I no longer 
commanded a fuel depot, nor yet a detachment of mobile tanks. 
But I had worked for too long with these fine fellows to feel that 
I was justified in concentrating attention on my own affairs until 
I had done something to assure their future—which, in this 
instance—meant their embarkation. For no one was concerned 
to look farther ahead than that. The one thought in everybody’s 
mind was to get clear of this damned stretch of coast before 
the enemy should smash through our last defences; to escape 
captivity by the sole road open to us—the sea. A sort of escape- 
hysteria had got hold of this mob of men. They were to all 
intents and purposes unarmed, and, from where they stood, 
packed together on the beaches, they could watch the English 
ahead of them already putting out to sea. I spent most of the 
30th in trying to get my men’s names on to the official evacuation 
lists. I went first to Bray-les-Dunes, which was chock-a-block 
with a disorderly crowd of soldiers searching for their units, and 
of lorries. Any man who happened to come along turned himself 
<b>19</b> into a driver, only, very often, to abandon his chance vehicle 
after a few hundred yards. Once more I appointed myself 
Traffic-Control Officer, and tried, without much success, to get 
some kind of efficiency into the unfortunate Military Police who 
were clustered in ridiculous groups at every cross-roads. A little 
later I might have been seen at the ‘Perroquet’ café on the Belgian 
frontier, which, for a few hours, served as a temporary 
headquarters for the Zone Commander. From there I went to Malo- 
les-Bains, where I found most of the ‘Q’ branch personnel. I 
spent that night bivouacking on the dunes. Our period of rest 
was punctuated by German shells. Fortunately, the enemy 
gunners, nothing if not methodical, concentrated on a point just 
to the left of the Malo-Terminus Hotel. The first salvoes claimed 
a number of victims. Thereafter the place was scrupulously 
avoided. If anyone had to pass near it, he did so at the run. Had 
the shooting been less accurate, what a scene of massacre there 
would have been in that sandy dormitory of ours among the 
sea-grasses!<br><br>
Early next day I was assured that my men would be got on 
board. How could I have known that a bomb would sink their 
ship? Still, most of them, though not all, alas, were fished out 
of the water. I was free at last to think about myself. Our former 
second-in-command, who was still in charge, showed no very 
great eagerness to get his subordinates away before he himself 
was safe. He did, however, give me permission to make what 
arrangements I could. The phrase sounded ominous. Did it 
mean that I was to pull a fast one on some other unfortunate? 
Luckily, early that afternoon, the commander of the Cavalry 
Corps was kind enough to furnish me and two of my friends 
with an official movement-order. Nothing now remained but 
to find the ship to which we had been detailed.<br><br>
As the result of a bungled message, the three of us were forced 
to go right through Dunkirk on two separate occasions, first 
from east to west, and then again in the reverse direction. I have 
<b>20</b> a very vivid memory of the ruined town with its shells of 
buildings half-visible through drifting smoke, and its clutter, not of 
bodies but of human debris, in the streets. I can still hear the 
incredible din which, like the orchestral finale of an opera, 
provided an accompaniment to the last few minutes which we spent 
on the coast of Flanders—the crashing of bombs, the bursting 
of shells, the rat-tat-tat of machine-guns, the noise of 
antiaircraft batteries, and, as a kind of figured bass, the persistent 
rattle of our own little naval pom-pom. But it is not the dangers 
and horrors of that day which have stuck most firmly in my 
memory. What comes back with especial clearness is our slow 
movement away from the jetty. A marvellous summer night 
shed its magic on the waters. The sky was pure gold, the sea a 
mirror, and the black, rank smoke, pouring from the burning 
refinery, made so lovely a pattern above the low shore-line that 
one was cheated into forgetting its tragic origin. Even the name 
painted on the stern of our vessel (<i>Royal Daffodil</i>) was like 
something out of an Indian fairy-tale. All things, as we slipped away, 
seemed to be in a conspiracy to accentuate the overwhelming 
and purely selfish feelings of relief which filled my mind as I 
thought of the prisoner’s fate which I had so narrowly escaped.<br><br>
We landed at Dover. Then came a whole day spent in 
travelling by train across southern England. That journey has left in 
my mind the memory of a sort of drugged exhaustion broken 
by chaotic sensations and images which, like the episodes of 
a dream, rose to the surface of my consciousness only to sink 
again almost immediately: the pleasure of devouring ham and 
cheese sandwiches handed through the windows by girls in 
multi-coloured dresses, and clergymen who looked as solemn 
as though they were administering the Sacrament; the faint, 
sweet smell of cigarettes showered on us with the same generous 
profusion; the acid taste of lemonade and the flat taste of tea with 
too much milk in it: the cosy green of lawns; a landscape made up 
of parks, cathedral spires, hedges, and Devonshire cliffs; groups 
<b>21</b> of cheering children at level-crossings. But what struck us more 
than anything else was the warmth of our reception. ‘How 
genuinely kind they are!’ said my companions. Towards 
evening we re-embarked at Plymouth, and dropped anchor at dawn 
off Cherbourg. We had to wait a long time in the harbour. 
‘You see/ said the ship’s officers (French this time), ‘the dock 
officials don’t get to their offices until nine.’ We were back, alas, 
in the rear zones of a France at war. No more cheering crowds, 
no more sandwiches or cigarettes. We were given, on landing, 
a formal, dry, rather suspicious welcome. The rest camp was an 
inhospitable and squalid place brightened by the presence of a 
few ladies belonging to the Red Cross. Later still, after having 
been shaken to pieces in averagely uncomfortable railway 
carriages, we arrived in the middle of the night at Caen, where 
nobody seemed to be expecting us, but where, fortunately, we 
found a number of good hotels—and even bathrooms!<br><br>
I shall have occasion at a later stage in this narrative of 
miseries to describe the efforts made to construct a serviceable 
fighting-force from the debris of an army, and to consider why 
the success achieved was so small. After remaining for some time 
in Normandy, we found ourselves finally stranded at Rennes. 
The First Army no longer existed. But Headquarters Staff, or 
what remained of it, was put at the disposition of the general 
commanding the ‘Group’ which had just been scraped together 
with the object, it was said, of defending Brittany. On 17 June 
Rennes was bombed from the air. We were stationed well 
outside the target zone, and if the sound of splintering glass caused 
by a direct hit, at some distance, on a dump of cheddite, made me 
wonder uneasily whether I might not be rather ‘out’ in my 
calculation of distances, these fears were quickly dissipated. 
‘How pleasant it is’, says the Roman poet, ‘to listen to a storm 
from the safe shelter of the shore.’ The quotation is trite, the 
confession not altogether admirable. But what soldier, hearing 
the sounds of a danger from which he knows himself to be 
<b>22</b> immune, is not conscious, deep in his heart, of a sense of purely 
animal relief?<br><br>

On the morning of the 18th a rumour got about that the 
enemy was advancing. Our office was situated on one of the 
boulevards of the upper town. From the opposite side of 
the main street a road led downhill to the more populous district 
in which my batman was billeted. About eleven o’clock I went to 
tell him to get my things packed immediately. I was climbing 
the hill on my way back when, at the far end of the street, I saw 
a German column debouching on the boulevard. It was moving 
between me and my office. Not a shot was fired. A number of 
French soldiers, including a few officers, just stood and watched. 
I learned later that whenever the Germans came across a soldier 
still in possession of his arms, they merely made him smash his 
rifle and empty his ammunition pouches. I had long decided that 
I would take any step to avoid capture. Had I believed that I 
might, even now, be of the slightest use, I could, I hope, have 
screwed myself to the necessary pitch of courage to remain at 
my post. But now that all show of resistance had melted away, 
there was obviously no point in carrying on with my duties. Or, 
perhaps, I should put it this way: that it was more and more 
clearly borne in on me that the only manner in which I could 
continue to serve my country and my family was by escaping 
before the trap should finally be sprung.<br><br>
It was obvious that if I tried to get away westwards—even 
assuming that any of the roads still remained open—I should 
merely get rounded up, sooner or later, in the cul-de-sac of the 
peninsula. If I went south there was a good chance that I should 
never get across the Loire. That, at least, was how I argued at 
the moment. I have since discovered that, contrary to my 
expectations, the Germans did not occupy Nantes until next day. 
But even had I tried that route, should I ever have succeeded in 
reaching the place? I also played with the idea of getting to 
Brest, where I might find some means of slipping across to 
<b>23</b> England. But should I have felt justified in abandoning my 
children and going into exile for an indefinite period? What, in 
fact, I did, after standing for a few moments deep in thought on 
the pavement of that hilly street, was to choose what seemed to 
me then the simplest, and, in the long run, the safest method of 
getting away. I went back to the house where I was billeted. 
There I took off my tunic. My rough serge trousers had nothing 
particularly military about them. From my landlord, who, with 
his son, showed, on this occasion, a high degree of courage, I 
got, without difficulty, the loan of a civilian jacket and tie. Then, 
after first making contact with an old friend who was a professor 
at Rennes, I booked a room in one of the hotels. Arguing that 
the best way to escape being noticed was to retain one’s identity, 
I put my real name and occupation on the form handed to me by 
the manager. My grey hairs were sufficient guarantee that no 
one would suspect the presence of an army officer beneath the 
outward semblance of so obviously academic a figure—unless, 
of course, it occurred to the German authorities to check the 
hotel registers with the parade strength of the military formations 
known to be in the neighbourhood. Such a course seems never 
to have entered their heads. No doubt our masters were already 
beginning to feel a bit blasé on the subject of prisoners.<br><br>
In this way I spent about a fortnight at Rennes. I was 
constantly running up against German officers in the streets, in 
restaurants, and even in my hotel. My mind was torn between 
the agony of seeing the cities of my native land given over to 
the invader, a sense of surprise at finding myself on peaceful 
terms with men whom, a few days earlier, I should never have 
dreamed of encountering save at the revolver’s point, and the 
malicious pleasure of pulling a fast one on these gentlemen 
without their having the slightest suspicion that I was doing 
anything of the sort. Not that this satisfaction was wholly unmixed. 
I have always felt a certain discomfort in living under false 
pretences, and though, in this case, I feel sure that my conduct would 
<b>24</b> have passed muster with the strictest of casuists, I could not help 
feeling amazement at the determination with which I continued 
to play my part. As soon as the railways were running again, I 
went to Angers, where I had a number of friends, and thence, by 
road, to Guéret and my family. Of the delights of this 
homecoming I shall say nothing. To speak of them would set my 
heart beating too fast. It is better to draw over them a curtain of 
silence.<br><br><br><br>


The reader will have gathered from what I have said, how 
limited was the nature of my experience—experience, I mean, of 
this war, since the former one comes into the picture only in so 
far as it provides a general background. I lived and worked at a 
fairly high staff level. True, I did not always know everything 
that was going on. Very often, as I shall hope to show, I was left 
without information essential to the proper performance of my 
duties. But, as a result of my daily routine, I was in a position 
to draw my own conclusions about both men and methods. On 
the other hand, I had no first-hand experience of fighting, and 
my contacts with the front-line troops were few and far between. 
In my references to them I have been compelled to rely on the 
evidence of others, which I was conveniently placed to collect 
and sift. I feel justified, therefore, in putting certain of my 
reflections on record, though nothing can really ever take the 
place of seeing things with one’s own eyes—provided one is 
blest with good sight. By relying on second-hand evidence one 
is bound to lose something of the truth and much of the human 
atmosphere. But no man exists who can claim to have witnessed 
everything at first-hand, or to have had all the knowledge 
available. The most we can ask is that each shall say frankly 
what he has to say. From a comparison of particular sincerities, 
truth will eventually emerge.<br><br><br><br>

<b>25</b><br><br>
<center><b>Chapter Two</b></center><br><br> 

<center><b>ONE OF THE VANQUISHED GIVES EVIDENCE</b></center><br><br> 

WE have just suffered such a defeat as no one would 
have believed possible. On whom or on what should 
the blame be laid? On the French system of 
parliamentary government, say our generals; on the rank and file of 
the fighting services, on the English, on the fifth column—in 
short, on any and everybody except themselves. Old Joffre was 
wiser. ‘Whether I was responsible for the winning of the Battle 
of the Marne’, he said, ‘I do not know. But of this I feel pretty 
certain, that, had it been lost, the failure would have been laid 
at my door.’ He intended, by that remark, to remind us that a 
commanding officer is responsible for everything that happens 
while he is in supreme charge of events. Whether the initiative 
for each separate decision comes directly from him, whether in 
each instance he knows what is being done, is beside the point. 
The mere fact that he has accepted the position of ‘Chief means 
that he must take upon his shoulders the burden of failure as well 
as the panoply of success. The great truth which that simple man 
expressed so unequivocably is seen to-day to have an even deeper 
meaning. When the Army was disbanded after the final campaign, 
it would have been hard to find a single officer among those with 
whom I was in daily contact who had the slightest doubt on the 
subject. Whatever the deep-seated causes of the disaster may have 
been, the immediate occasion (as I shall attempt to explain later) 
was the utter incompetence of the High Command.[1]<br><br>
<b>26</b> I very much fear that this brutally frank assertion may shock 
many in whose minds certain prejudices are deeply rooted. 
Almost the whole of our national Press, and the more academic 
portions of our national literature, have, as I see it, consistently 
upheld the conventional view in these matters. For a great many 
journalists and for a considerable number of ‘patriotic’ authors, 
any general is, by definition, a great general. If he leads his men 
to disaster, he is duly rewarded with a high class of the Legion of 
Honour. No doubt the argument runs that only by drawing a 
decent veil over the more glaring indiscretions of our public men 
can the morale of the country be kept at a high level. In fact, 
the only result of this method is to sow the seeds of a dangerous 
irritation in the minds of those who make up the fighting forces. 
But there are other motives, too; some of them, perhaps, not 
quite so discreditable.<br><br>
A somewhat odd historical law seems to control the relations 
existing between States and their military chiefs. Successful 
soldiers are almost always kept from exercising any political 
power, though the failures receive it as a free gift from the hands 
of those very citizens whom they have been unable to lead to 
victory. MacMahon in spite of Sedan, Hindenburg after the 
collapse of 1918, were both chosen to preside over the régimes 
which emerged from defeat. It is not the Pétain of Verdun or 
the Weygand of Rethondes whom France to-day has promoted 
or accepted. I realize, of course, that recent events did not result 
wholly from a spontaneous movement of the popular will. Still, 
they do stand in some sort of relation to what is, in effect, a form 
of collective psychosis. In the eyes of the defeated, uniforms 
bristling with badges of rank and smothered in decorations 
symbolize not only sacrifices willingly endured on the field of 
battle, but also the glories of our past and, quite possibly, of 
our future. When a widely held opinion is glaringly at odds 
<b>27</b> with the truth, we are bound in honesty, I think, to attack it. 
I share Pascal’s view that ‘it is a very strange kind of enthusiasm 
that is roused to fury against those who point out the errors of 
our public men, rather than against the men themselves . . . ‘. 
‘The Saints’, he writes elsewhere, ‘have never kept silent.’ It 
is not my intention to use the phrase as a general justification for 
every kind of fault-finding. Nevertheless, it should be carefully 
pondered by all who—without, alas, being able to lay claim to 
sanctity—try to govern their lives by the standards of the normal 
decent man. Those who genuinely respect these will find that it 
is impossible, with an easy conscience, to avoid doing their duty.<br><br>
I referred a while back to the ‘High Command’. But scarcely 
had my pen written the words than the historian in me was 
shocked by their use. For the ABC of my trade consists in 
avoiding big-sounding abstract terms. Those who teach history 
should be continually concerned with the task of seeking the 
solid and the concrete behind the empty and the abstract. In 
other words, it is on men rather than functions that they should 
concentrate their attention. The errors of the High Command 
were, fundamentally, the errors of a specific group of human 
beings. <br><br>
I have had little to do with the men at the top. Both my 
junior rank and the nature of my duties kept me at a distance from 
them. The only one with whom I had occasional dealings of a 
kind that might be called in any degree intimate was General 
Blanchard. My chief memory of him is that of a man whose 
outstanding characteristic was ‘good breeding’. The last time he 
honoured me with a few words was when we met in Normandy 
just after I had got back from Flanders. On that occasion he 
said, in tones of kindly interest: ‘So you, too, managed to get 
out of that adventure with a whole skin?’ The phrase hardly 
seemed, I must confess, altogether suited to the occasion. Félix, 
in the last scene of <i>Polyeucte</i>, is guilty of much the same sort of 
inappropriate remark when he says ‘<i>Bénissons notre heureuse</i> 
<b>28</b> <i>aventure!</i>’—on which Voltaire makes the following comment: 
‘It is hard to keep from laughing when a man who has just cut 
his son-in-law’s throat speaks like that!’ Blanchard’s own part 
in the Flanders ‘adventure’ had been to lose more than half his 
army, and to abandon not only his own Chief of Staff, but the 
officer whom he had himself nominated as his successor, both 
of whom had stood their ground though perfectly well aware 
that they would be captured. I know that one should never 
judge a man on the evidence of a single piece of ill-luck. But 
one morning, when we were at the Château of Attiches, I was 
called to the telephone very early to speak to British G.H.Q. 
On that occasion I spent more than an hour in the same room as 
the general. During all that time he sat in tragic immobility, 
saying nothing, doing nothing, but just gazing at the map spread 
on the table between us, as though hoping to find on it the decision 
which he was incapable of taking. At Attiches, too, I quite 
accidentally overheard him say something which amazed me at 
the time, and about which I shall have some remarks to make 
later. On the whole, however, my knowledge of him was 
confined to the orders that he issued, and I find it difficult, where 
they are concerned, to distinguish between what he did on his 
own initiative and what he was persuaded to do by his staff.<br><br>
I was, naturally enough, very much more familiar with the 
officers who were my immediate seniors or my colleagues. Most 
of them were regulars who had been through the Staff College. 
So well did I know them that I must resist the temptation to 
paint what would be a highly personal composite portrait of the 
‘Staff Officer Type’. When I shut my eyes and rummage among 
the memories of the past, I see a long line of sharply differentiated 
individuals. Some of them are just figures of fun. Others will 
remain dear to me for as long as I live. There was, for instance, 
Captain B . . . of ‘G’ branch, who moved with his empty head 
for ever in the clouds. Like a priest at the Elevation, he seemed 
to spend his time in administering to a crowd of worshippers the 
<b>29</b> book-knowledge which he had absorbed in the course of endless 
peace-time manœuvres. Then there was Captain X..., a former 
fellow-officer in the regiment, whose mouth spoke louder than 
his actions. Like so many regulars, he seemed to regard it as his 
especial duty to keep his juniors ‘in their place’, with the result 
that, after a few months, he was thoroughly hated by the lot 
of us. How we laughed each time he went off to spend the 
night in a deep dug-out! Very different from such fire-eaters 
was that dear mess-companion of ours who was always ready 
with a helping hand, who never paraded his courage, and who 
performed with such unostentatious efficiency the duties which 
fell to him first as adjutant to our immediate chief, and later as 
liaison officer. Against him I have only one serious charge to 
bring. He was too easily discouraged. As a result, perhaps, of 
physical fatigue, or perhaps because he saw his dreams of what 
war ought to be, crumble in the harsh air of reality, he let 
himself be quite unnecessarily captured one evening after a gruelling 
time at Steenwerck. To do that was, in itself, a proof of 
terrible mental suffering, and even worse was in store for him 
when news of the armistice reached him through the medium 
of a German newspaper.<br><br>
We had, from the days of Bohain on, plenty of opportunity 
to gauge the value of the men I have mentioned, but the heat of 
battle brought many a revelation—not always of the kind we 
might have expected.<br><br>
Take, for instance, the case of that senior officer who had 
emerged from the war of 1914 with an imposing array of 
decorations. We were well placed in advance to know his good 
qualities—which were not lacking in charm—and also of his 
bad ones, which were of formidable dimensions. He had a sense 
of reality, though with it went a lack of mental discipline. He 
was endowed with a gift of ‘muddling through’, but showed a 
mulish dislike of planning ahead. He was pleasant in his dealings 
with colleagues or inferiors, but not seldom lacking in frankness. 
<b>30</b> None of us, however, could possibly have foreseen the way in 
which he completely went to pieces when faced by the 
imperatives of action. Looking back on what happened, and speaking 
quite frankly, I cannot help feeling now that we may have been 
a bit unfair in our attitude to him. I am afraid that, without ever 
really giving the matter much thought, we rather crudely 
attributed to weakness in the face of danger what—though it had all 
the outward symptoms of fear—was probably due in the main 
to an almost prophetic awareness of the catastrophe hanging over 
our heads. To make matters worse, he was cursed with an excess 
of sensibility, and knew that the load he had to carry was too 
heavy for him. He told me himself, at Attiches, that the duty of 
detailing those members of the staff who were to remain with the 
advanced elements was more than he could face. But one thing 
is certain. Weighed down, I do not doubt, by years spent in 
office work and conditioned by a purely academic training, this 
regular soldier had lost every quality of leadership—and of the 
self-control and ruthlessness which the word implies.<br><br>
Turning to the other panel of the diptych, how can I resist the 
temptation to evoke for memory’s eye that tall fair-haired 
captain of gunners who, when things at Attiches and at Steen- 
werck were at their worst, took over command of our Advanced 
H.Q.? Earlier, at Bohain, where he had been in charge of 
supplies, we had thought him fussy and a bit given to eyewash. 
He was not particularly quick-witted, and, as a bred-in-the-bone 
cavalryman, never ceased to announce his dislike of brain-work. 
We could not help respecting the way in which he would 
maintain any opinion in which he believed through thick and thin, 
even in the teeth of his superiors, though we found his spirit 
of contradiction decidedly irritating. His—perhaps rather 
deliberately assumed—liking for scatological humour soon wearied 
even the least squeamish among us. His prejudices—political, 
social (he came from the upper middle-class), and, presumably, 
racial—were as alien to my own outlook as they possibly could 
<b>31</b> be. Still, we got along perfectly well together, though neither of 
us, I fear, showed any special warmth of affection for the other.<br><br>
Then came the campaign of the Nord. When the end could 
no longer be in doubt, General Prioux decided that each H.Q. 
section should nominate an officer to stay with him until the 
enemy arrived. T..., as I have already said, was at that time in 
charge of our office. He maintained that the fact of his holding 
such a position made it impossible for him to ask anybody else 
to take on a job which meant inevitable self-sacrifice. But he was 
strong-minded, and did not hold that the acceptance of an 
unnecessary captivity was any part of an honourable soldier’s duty. 
What he planned was something quite different. As he has since 
told me in confidence, he spent that last night with his eye glued 
to a hole in the hedge, intending to jump out on the Germans 
revolver in hand. And he would most certainly have been as 
good as his word had not something occurred unexpectedly at 
the last moment to restore his liberty of movement. During the 
night the Commander of the Fourth Corps suddenly appeared 
at Advanced H.Q. It had become clear that none of the units in 
his formation would be able to re-cross the Lys, and he had 
therefore decided to throw in his lot with that of the Army 
Commander. Naturally, he was accompanied by his liaison 
officer, who turned out to be a member of our own mess. The 
poor fellow refused, as I have already explained, to take advantage 
of this opportunity to reach the coast, and this attitude of 
unselfishness, though it was the outcome of excessive exhaustion, 
saved T. . . . The general had asked each section to detail one 
officer who would remain behind and be taken prisoner. T . . . 
was given permission to leave. Next morning we were surprised 
and delighted to see him appear, punctual almost to the dot, at 
our first rendezvous, which was not far from Hondschoote, 
riding a brand-new bicycle which he had picked up in the course 
of his journey in one of the deserted streets of Bailleul.<br><br>
Next evening we said good-bye to one another in an 
<b>32</b> atmosphere of considerable, if suppressed, emotion. If we did 
not admit in so many words that we had previously been quite 
wrong in our mutual attitude and deeply regretted it, that is 
because such things are usually left unspoken. It was enough that 
we should both feel as we did. Since then, the accidents of the 
times have so completely separated us that I have no idea as I 
write these lines whether he is still alive. If we ever do meet 
again, I have a horrid feeling that we shall once more find 
ourselves at odds: but not in quite the old way. I, certainly, shall 
find it impossible to forget those few moments, so charged with 
personal electricity, which we passed in one another’s company 
in a garden at Steenwerck or the period which led up to, and was 
conditioned by, them. It is one of the privileges of the true man 
of action that, when the critical moment comes, blemishes of 
character are effaced, while virtues, till then potential merely, are 
seen in an unexpectedly vivid light. Of this metamorphosis our 
friend gave an unexpected and outstanding example. He had 
always been both conscientious and sincere. Faced by a genuine 
test, his preoccupation with trivialities ceased to operate, and his 
spirit of contradiction vanished. Always ready to instruct and 
to direct, he was the type of leader who knows how to leave to 
his subordinates that freedom of action which is so necessary if 
they are to carry out his orders effectively, though he never 
attempted to shuffle out of his ultimate responsibility for them. 
He was patient and calm no matter how desperate the situation 
might be, and, if he refused to accept physical exhaustion in 
others as an excuse for failure, would himself work till he dropped. 
And what a good fellow he was! Knowing him, I feel that I 
have known one really great man.<br><br>
But in every human group there is something over and above 
the individuals who compose it, and the more clearly defined 
the community to which they belong, the more do their own 
characteristics become blurred. Similarity of training, 
professional routine, and the need to submit to the rules and regulations 
<b>33</b> of a common way of life are not, in themselves, enough to hold 
a group together. What is needed is something more than a 
tradition handed down by seniors to juniors, by leaders to 
subordinates; it is an <i>esprit de corps</i>. This is particularly true in the 
case of military organizations. Within the body of the nation 
the officers of the regular army form a separate and distinct 
society. Embodying, as it does, a number of habits and attitudes 
which are survivals from an earlier age, it is peculiarly suited to 
restore, in the general dead level of modern life, that idea of 
‘hierarchy’ which was never, in our older France, completely 
identical with ‘class’. The members of the nobility always, in 
spite of great differences of blood, had a very definite idea of basic 
equality. So strong was this sense, in fact, that the sovereign, 
qua man, was looked upon as being no more than the ‘first 
gentleman of his kingdom’. Similarly, to-day, if a general officer, no 
matter how senior his rank, entering a room where a junior 
officer was working, were to fail to shake hands with him, he 
would be considered to have offended against the most elementary 
rules of good behaviour. On the other hand, if the man he saw 
there was—I won’t say a private, but an N.C.O.—he would 
do so only in the most exceptional circumstances. Within the 
military hierarchy again, the world of staff officers forms a 
remarkably homogeneous whole, having many clearly marked 
characteristics. Of these, the most honourable is undoubtedly 
its strong sense of professional duty, though this it shares, I am 
quite sure, with all officers of the regular army no matter what 
their rank. No doubt there are among the graduates of the Staff 
College—as elsewhere—idlers and irresponsibles, but except 
in one instance I have never met them, and the individual who 
was the exception referred to had quite obviously been summed 
up by his colleagues and sent to vegetate in a staff job of very 
minor importance. It is hard to overestimate this particular 
virtue, and it is a pity that other branches of the national service 
do not possess it to a similar degree.<br><br>

<b>34</b> There has been much talk about the contempt shown for the 
regimental officer by his opposite number on the staff. I do not 
deny that there may be a number of conceited individuals who 
show an irritating Staff-College mentality, but the species is, on 
the whole, a rare one. It is only fair to say that all the staff officers 
with whom I have had dealings were extremely anxious (or said 
they were) to return to regimental duties. No doubt it was the 
‘smart’ attitude to take, and their eloquence may have owed not 
a little to snobbery. Some I have known who showed a much- 
diminished enthusiasm when they had ‘their backs to the wall’. 
Still, my own feeling is that in the vast majority of cases— 
especially among the younger men—this feeling was perfectly 
genuine. However that may be, it is not a little significant that 
such a peculiar form of snobbery should have come to exist at 
all, and that it should be a matter of ‘good form’ to express 
admiration for, and envy of, the front-line formations.<br><br>
Misunderstandings are bound to occur at times in all armies, 
no matter what their nationality, between administrative and 
executive services. But it is not always the former who are 
responsible. Problems look different according to the angle from 
which they are observed, and those whose functions are not the 
same can hardly be expected to see eye to eye. The ‘thinking 
oneself into the other fellow’s shoes’ is always a very difficult 
form of mental gymnastics, and it is not confined to men who 
occupy a special position in the military hierarchy. But it would 
be foolish to deny that staff officers as a whole have been a good 
deal to blame in this matter of sympathetic understanding. Their 
failure, when they did fail, was, however, due—I feel pretty 
sure—not so much to contempt as to lack of imagination and a 
tendency to take refuge from the urgency of fact in abstractions. 
In the days before the real fighting had begun, we spent a lot of 
time working out troop movements on the map. But how many 
of us ever adequately realized what problems of detail, what 
frictions of psychology, are involved when, in the depth of 
<b>35</b> winter, men are asked to leave billets in which they have settled 
down and move somewhere else into what are, only too often, 
bad and unsuitable quarters? But that is not the worst of the 
staff’s shortcomings. More than once during the First World 
War it was brought home to me how inefficient the High 
Command could be when it came to calculating accurately the length 
of time needed for an order, once issued from H.Q., to pass 
through its various recipients until finally it reached the 
formations who would have to act upon it. No amount of ‘instructions’ 
will ever succeed in convincing the unimaginative that a runner’s 
pace is slow, and that he will often go wrong when roads and 
tracks have been turned into a sea of mud. On 22 July 19181 was 
serving with Mangin’s Army—in which the methods of 
intercommunication were particularly unsatisfactory. On one 
occasion I was appalled to receive for re-transmission an order to 
attack at such short notice that it was impossible to get it to the 
troops concerned in time. They were actually already on the 
move. When it did arrive, it was so late that the battalion 
detailed to carry it out had no opportunity to reconnoitre the 
ground before daylight, advanced to the assault on a wrong 
bearing, and was slaughtered almost to a man, quite uselessly. 
I am not at all sure that the conduct of the Second World War 
was entirely free from similar mistakes. The blame for them 
falls, not on individuals, but on the whole method of training in 
vogue at the time. This is a subject to which I shall return later.<br><br>
One simple and obvious remedy for this state of affairs would 
have been to establish a system which would have made it 
possible for small groups of officers to serve, turn and turn about, in 
the front line and at H.Q. But senior generals dislike having the 
personnel of their staffs changed too often. It should be 
remembered that in 1915 and 1916 their opposition to any reform 
along these lines led to an almost complete divorce between the 
outlook of the regimental and the staff officer. When, finally, 
it was found to be impossible to go on any longer in the old way, 
<b>36</b> the necessary changes had been too long delayed, with the result 
that transfers had to be made on far too large a scale. By that 
time, too, our heavy losses had made it almost impossible to 
provide a sufficient number of officers suited to fill H.Q. 
appointments. It does not follow that a good company or battalion 
commander will be a good staff officer. It made me very uneasy 
to see, during the winter of 1939-40, that the old system of 
watertight compartments was once again in the ascendant. I did my 
best to point out its inherent dangers to those in high places, but 
the crisis of the following May and June developed so quickly 
that the bad effects were not fully felt.<br><br>
Honest, markedly anxious to do their best, deeply patriotic, 
and, for the most part, a great deal less mentally hide-bound than 
the technicians and the regular officers from whom they are 
recruited, at times, even, genuinely brilliant, the members of the 
General Staff do, generally speaking, form a body of men who 
are deserving of the highest esteem. Still, it cannot be denied 
that, by their own actions, or by those of the generals drawn from 
their number, they did lead us to defeat. Why was this? Before 
I attempt to answer that question I had better first describe how 
this unfortunate result came about.<br><br><br><br>
I make no claim to be writing a critical history of the war, or 
even of the campaign of the Nord. I have not had access to any 
of the documents necessary for such an undertaking, nor do I 
possess the requisite technical knowledge. But there are certain 
obvious facts which should be made clear without further delay. 
What drove our armies to disaster was the cumulative effect 
of a great number of different mistakes. One glaring 
characteristic is, however, common to all of them. Our leaders, or those 
who acted for them, were incapable of thinking in terms of a 
new war. In other words, the German triumph was, essentially, 
a triumph of intellect—and it is that which makes it so peculiarly 
serious.<br><br>
<b>37</b> Let me be more precise. One fact, but that one of radical 
importance, differentiates our contemporary civilization from 
any of those that preceded it. Since the beginning of the twentieth 
century the whole idea of distance has changed. This alteration 
in spatial values came about in little more than a single 
generation. But rapid though it was, it has become so much a part of 
our mental habit that we are inclined to forget how revolutionary 
its effects have been. What is happening to-day may serve to 
open our eyes. The privations resulting from war and defeat 
have had upon Europe the repercussions of a Time Machine in 
reverse. We have been plunged suddenly into a way of life which, 
only quite recently, we thought had disappeared for ever. I am 
writing these lines in my house in the country. A year ago, 
when I and the local tradesmen had all the petrol we needed, the 
county town, on which the economic life of the district centres, 
seemed close at hand. Now, when bicycles are the quickest means 
of transport available, and heavy loads have to be carried in 
donkey-wagons, every trip to market becomes a major 
expedition. We have gone back thirty or forty years! The ruling idea 
of the Germans in the conduct of this war was speed. We, on 
the other hand, did our thinking in terms of yesterday or the day 
before. Worse still: faced by the undisputed evidence of 
Germany’s new tactics, we ignored, or wholly failed to 
understand, the quickened rhythm of the times. So true is this, that 
it was as though the two opposed forces belonged, each of them, 
to an entirely different period of human history. We interpreted 
war in terms of assagai versus rifle made familiar to us by long 
years of colonial expansion. But this time it was we who were 
cast for the rôle of the savage![1]<br><br>
<b>38</b> Read over again the list of places where the First Army 
established its headquarters during the campaign of the Nord: 
Valenciennes, Douai, Lens, Estaires, Attiches, Steenwerck. Each 
time the enemy exerted pressure there was a withdrawal. This 
was only to be expected. But what was the extent of these 
withdrawals? The average was between 20 and 30 kilometres, never 
more than 30. In other words—remembering Vidal de la 
Blanche’s aphorism that the time taken in covering a given 
distance, rather than the distance itself, is what matters to-day— 
approximately half an hour’s run by car. Naturally, the 
movement of the defensive line was strictly related to that of 
headquarters, and corresponded to such limitation of advance as the 
High Command thought it could impose upon the enemy. At 
our school-house in Lens we were well within earshot of machine- 
gun fire. The old soldiers of 1914 might well feel inclined to 
draw comparisons when they remembered how seldom such 
sounds had reached the back areas in those days. I can hardly 
believe that our leaders were solely actuated by a desire to give 
their staffs this particular form of treat! The truth of the matter 
was that the Germans advanced a great deal faster than they 
should have done according to the old rules of the game. And 
so it went on. ‘Niggling’ was how I heard our strategic methods 
described by a colleague of mine, one of those younger men who 
did at least know how to think in contemporary terms, and 
suffered under a perpetual sense of frustration because of the way 
in which they were consistently ignored by their superiors. One 
could, however, fully realize a situation, the nature of which was 
only too clear, without having worn out the seat of one’s pants 
on the benches of the Staff College or of the C.H.E.M. (<i>Centre 
des Hautes Études Militaires</i>). It was perfectly obvious that as 
soon as the Army of the Meuse had been broken, and the enemy 
began to show signs of becoming active on our front, the only 
hope of re-establishing the general situation lay in our 
‘disengaging’, and establishing a new defensive line sufficiently far 
<b>39</b> back to ensure that it would not be overrun before it had been 
properly organized. But nothing of the sort was done. Instead, 
small groups of reinforcements were continually dribbled into 
every breach as it occurred, with the inevitable result that they 
were cut to pieces. At the same time our masters showed a 
mulish determination to maintain a salient in the direction of 
Valenciennes and Denain, the only consequence of which was 
that, when finally it was decided to retreat to the coast, the 
divisions left to hold these advanced positions could not be 
withdrawn in time. If Joffre had behaved like that after Charleroi 
and Maubeuge, he would never have won the Marne That 
battle would have developed, instead, somewhere in the direction 
of Guise, and he would have lost it. Remember, too, that in his 
day opposing armies moved only on foot.<br><br>
I do not pretend to know on which of the various commands— 
First Army, G.H.Q., or First Army Group (which held a sort 
of middle position)—the main responsibility for these mistakes 
rested. The Army Group was at first under General Billotte who, 
after 25 May, was replaced by General Blanchard. Billotte was 
mortally injured in a car smash on the 21st, and cannot, 
therefore, speak in his own defence. His convenient disappearance 
from the scene led to his being cast for the rôle of scapegoat, and, 
to judge from the odds and ends of gossip which I picked up in 
our gloomy little mess-room at Malo-les-Bains, his colleagues 
were only too glad to let him play it for all it was worth.<br><br>
There can be no doubt that our whole plan of campaign was 
wrong. What <i>should</i> have been the reply of the Anglo-French 
forces to the German invasion of Belgium? The problem had 
been discussed all through the winter by the various ‘G’ staffs. 
Two solutions, among many others, found particular favour. 
One school of thought maintained that we ought to stand on a 
line in Belgium based at its northern end on the Escaut, with its 
eastern resting on the (unfortunately incomplete) system of 
blockhouses and anti-tank ditches which roughly followed the 
<b>40</b> line of the frontier. Forward elements were to be given the duty 
of reconnoitring and fighting a delaying action. The other school 
favoured immediate offensive action across the frontier, and, with 
that intention, proposed that, as soon as the Germans moved, 
we should advance to, and occupy, the left bank of the Dyle and 
of the Belgian Meuse, with the forces between these two points 
spread out along a diagonal lying from Wavre to Namur across 
the high plateau of Hesbaye which is almost entirely devoid of 
natural obstacles. As everybody knows, it was this second plan 
that ultimately carried the day, and it seems fairly certain that 
General Billotte’s personal influence was decisive in imposing 
this decision.<br><br>
The choice was, probably, in any case an unfortunate one. It 
certainly became so once the Belgian resistance round Liege 
began to crumble. We had been relying on a respite of several 
days in which to man and organize our new front. The failure 
to destroy the bridges between Liege and Maastricht, as planned, 
meant that the position was turned almost at the outset of the 
German offensive. The reports received from Intelligence made 
it pretty clear that it must collapse pretty soon. Nor was that all. 
Our first encounters with the enemy had produced a number of 
unpleasant surprises.<br><br>
Not only were the German tanks a great deal more numerous 
than Intelligence had led us to suppose: some of them were quite 
unexpectedly powerful. The extent to which our Air Force was 
outclassed was truly appalling. The job of making contact to 
the east of the Dyle and the Wavre-Namur line had been 
entrusted to the Cavalry Corps. This, in spite of its traditional 
title, was entirely motorized—’the only formation with which I 
have never had anything to do’, the Army Veterinary Officer 
said to me one day. General Prioux, who at that time was in 
command of this strong concentration of troops, proposed on 
the nth that the whole plan should be abandoned, and the line 
at once withdrawn to the Escaut and the French frontier. Once 
<b>41</b> again, Billotte intervened. When an officer of such exalted rank 
takes the trouble to play a part in strategic decisions, it is rarely, 
indeed, that he does not carry the day. I have good reason for 
believing that Prioux, after an interview with the Group 
Commander, agreed at least to modify his memorandum. However 
that may be, it was, in the event, completely ignored.<br><br>
What, I wonder, would have happened to our First Army and 
to the Anglo-French forces on its left, if the yawning gap on the 
Meuse had not, contrary to all expectation, suddenly developed 
on its right flank? I do not feel competent to commit myself to 
any prophecy after the event. On 14 May a section of our front 
was broken. It had been held by a Moroccan division. The 
native troops of which it was composed seem, at first, anyhow, 
to have stood up very badly to aerial bombardment and tanks. 
But the line was re-established pretty quickly.<br><br>
There can be no doubt whatever that it was the collapse of the 
Armies of the Meuse and at Sedan which, by uncovering the rear 
of the troops engaged in Belgium, led to the complete failure of 
the entire scheme. How came it that the sharply escarped valley 
of a large river, which everybody had regarded as providing an 
ideal defensive position, was, in fact, so badly held? Up till now 
I have succeeded in gathering only a few contradictory rumours 
bearing on this incident which was one of the most important 
and, perhaps, surprising, of the whole war. But I do know, only 
too well, that the High Command was lamentably slow in 
learning its lessons.<br><br>
On 13 May we were informed that the line of the Meuse 
had been broken. On the very same day, an order, signed 
by Gamelin, was issued to the effect that resistance must be 
maintained on the Wavre-Namur position. Not until the 15 th 
was it decided to begin a general movement of withdrawal, and 
even then, as I have already had occasion to note, the operation 
was carried out in a very piecemeal fashion. No alteration 
whatever was brought about in these methods either by the 
<b>42</b> replacement of Gamelin by Weygand (which took place on 
the 20th) or by the call next day which the new Commander-in- 
Chief set out to make on Lord Gort and General Billotte.[1] This 
highly dramatic journey had to be made by air, because land 
communications were already disrupted as far north as the coast. It 
was on his way back from this expedition that the Army Group 
Commander, who always, it was said, drove at breakneck speed, 
crashed into a lorry. What precisely had been the part played 
by this officer in the events of the 13th onwards? I have no 
special information on the point. But one thing is certain: the 
errors committed at that time had results out of all proportion to 
their cause. In themselves they were a great deal less unforgivable 
than was the initial plan of campaign—for all its seeming dash 
and brilliance. After all, many great soldiers have started off 
on the wrong foot. Early mistakes become tragic only when the 
men in charge are incapable of putting them right. Billotte’s 
disappearance from the scene might have led men to suppose that 
a new wind would begin to blow at headquarters. But such was 
not the case. That he had faults no one would dream of denying, 
but it seems probable that they were not peculiar to him, but 
were common to the whole school of thought which he 
represented. <br><br>
The campaign of the Nord taught us a number of hard lessons. 
Can one say that they did, at least, convince our masters that the 
whole rhythm of modern warfare had changed its tempo? The 
answer to that question is to be found in the final convulsions 
which engulfed the remnants which succeeded in escaping from 
the disasters of the Flemish theatre. The ships which had 
enabled us to avoid captivity threw upon the coast of France a 
confused medley of elements disorganized by retreat, by the 
<b>43</b> chaotic conditions of their embarkation, and by, in some cases, 
actual shipwreck. They were without arms of any kind. Whole 
units had to be sorted out, reorganized, and completely re- 
equipped. For this delicate and necessarily slow operation the 
High Command chose a tract of country which barely extended 
from Evreux to Caen. The Somme front, which was still fluid, 
lay on an average no more than 150 kilometres distant. That 
would have been more than enough in the days of Napoleon: it 
would have been adequate even in 1915: in the year of grace 
1940 it amounted to just nothing at all. The Germans soon left 
us in no doubt of that. We were compelled, almost at once, to 
withdraw in a southerly direction, at first, following our usual 
custom, only a few miles, but later, very much farther. But by 
then the final disaster had already begun to take shape. Actually, 
we should have been taken down to the Charente, if not to the 
Garonne, for regrouping; to some area, that is, where we should 
have been well placed for a move in any direction. Had that 
been done we might still have been in a position~to make 
ourselves felt. I feel as bitterly angry when I think of it to-day as I 
did in those successive Norman châteaux between which we 
moved. Nor were we the only victims—or even the most to be 
pitied—of an astonishing thick-headedness which consistently 
refused to draw the obvious conclusions. The Germans 
advancing towards the plains of the Saône, the Jura, and the Rhine were 
given ample time in which to surround the French Armies of the 
East, and almost to surround the Army of the Alps. From the 
beginning to the end of the war, the metronome at headquarters 
was always set at too slow a beat. One particular incident, which 
was significant though not, in itself, of any great practical 
importance, served me as proof that this curious form of mental 
sclerosis was not confined to those senior members of the 
hierarchy who were to blame for having withdrawn us for 
regrouping no farther than the area immediately behind the front. 
When the task of carrying out this reorganization was at last, 
<b>44</b> after much shilly-shallying, entrusted to the General 
Commanding the 16th Corps, the staff of the First Army, which had nothing 
to do and was in thoroughly bad odour with the authorities, 
found itself immobilized in the area south of Caen, where its 
members occupied two small country houses. At last, on 15 June, 
we received orders to report to Rennes. The journey was to be 
made partly by rail, partly by road. The number of cars available 
was small, and in the early stages of the move what there were 
were used to take the train-parties to the station. By evening this 
shuttle service had been concluded and I set off with a friend to 
find the lieutenant-colonel who was the highest-ranking officer 
on the spot. Our object was to convince him of the necessity of 
getting us started as soon as possible. Everyone knew that 
German motorized columns were infiltrating into Normandy, 
and that they were, in particular, threatening our 
communications with the south. A consignment of officers, unarmed except 
for a few revolvers, would have made a poor showing in the 
event of a surprise encounter with mobile machine-gunners. 
There was considerable risk that we might, quite unnecessarily, 
find ourselves captured in the very act of withdrawing, and such 
a prospect was, to say the least, extremely unpopular. The 
lieutenant-colonel began his usual humming and ha’ing, but the 
idea of arriving at Rennes after dark, and of being exposed to a 
good deal of inconvenience as a result, finally decided him to 
postpone breaking camp until the early hours of the next 
morning. Truth obliges me to confess that, as things turned out, this 
delay had no ill effects. The fact remains, however, that it 
represented the height of imprudence, and its occurrence inclines 
me to believe that there may have been more truth than is 
popularly allowed in the story of the still higher ranking officer 
who, dining at ease on the banks of the Oise, suddenly found 
himself surrounded by a party <i>feldgrau</i>.<br><br>
Did we ever, really, in the whole course of the campaign 
know the precise location of the enemy at any given time? That 
<b>45</b> our commanders should have had a very imperfect idea of his 
intentions, and, worse still, of his material resources, can easily 
be explained by the faulty organization of our Intelligence 
Service. But the fact that we were never quite certain of his 
movements was due mainly to a persistent failure ever to judge 
distances correctly. Our own rate of progress was too slow and 
our minds were too inelastic for us ever to admit the possibility 
that the enemy might move with the speed which he actually 
achieved. When we left Lens on 22 June, H.Q. was split into 
two sections—an ‘advanced’ group at Estaires, with a less mobile 
organization at Merville, where it was thought that it would be 
at a safe distance from the theatre of operations. What was our 
surprise when it was borne in upon us that, in fact, the so-called 
‘rear’ H.Q. was a great deal closer to the line than its advanced 
brother! When the Germans crashed through the Meuse 
defences, we were compelled to improvise at short notice 
alternative rail-heads for the division which we were preparing to rush 
into the lion’s mouth in the hope of blocking egress from the 
pocket.<br><br>
After our arrival in Flanders there was a marked increase in 
the number of such miscalculations. On one occasion a divisional 
commander, making his way to the map-reference at which it 
had been decided to establish his headquarters, found that he had 
been anticipated by the enemy. I still have an unpleasant feeling 
in the pit of my stomach when I remember one tragic incident 
which I very nearly precipitated—in all innocence, let me add, 
since I had no means of appreciating the situation, and was not 
to blame if the information available to other members of the 
staff had not been passed on to me in time to be utilized. I had 
arranged to move one of my mobile fuel-supply companies 
farther back, to some point where it would be less dangerously 
within striking distance of our eastern front. The necessary orders 
had already gone out when I learned that the Germans, 
advancing from the south-west, had already occupied the village for 
<b>46</b> which my men were making. By a miracle the column was held 
up in a traffic jam, and never arrived. Part of a motor-transport 
group, however, was less fortunate. As it was.approaching the 
outskirts of the town which had been allotted to it by Army 
H.Q. as its billeting area, it was met by heavy-machine-gun fire. 
Every man jack of its personnel was either killed or taken 
prisoner.<br><br>
Shall I ever forget, finally, how the news reached us that the 
French section of our road to the sea was on the point of being 
cut? Lachamp and I had, already, some days earlier, evacuated 
most of our fuel park to a camp at no great distance from the 
coast. One by one our permanent depots had all been overrun 
until we could depend only on those in the immediate 
neighbourhood of Lille. When we were lucky enough to find a few odd 
railway trucks loaded with petrol tins, we thought it simpler to 
let the various units take what they wanted without more ado. 
Consequently, our servicing staff had practically nothing to 
occupy them. We had with us only one small detachment of 
fighting troops, and a number of officers most of whom were 
employed in keeping open our communications with the various 
corps. Meanwhile the Army, now in full retreat, was 
concentrating in an area which grew daily more constricted, so constricted 
in fact that the different Corps H.Q. were finally situated so close 
to one another that we could easily visit all of them in a couple 
of trips or so. It seemed to us, therefore, the merest common 
sense not to expose to the risk of capture any more officers than 
were strictly necessary. On the evening of the 26th we decided 
to send one of these officers to make contact with the main body 
of our supply personnel. In the course of the morning of the 
28th he returned to Steenwerck. It appeared that at some point 
between Steenwerck and Cassel, on the road that he had been 
told to take, he had run into a detachment of enemy tanks. This 
was serious news, and I at once passed on the information to 
my superiors. ‘Are you quite sure that they weren’t French 
<b>47</b> tanks?’ asked the first member of ‘G’ branch whom we saw. 
F . . . replied that he had every reason to think they were not, 
since there had been an exchange of shots between their crews 
and our own troops. General Prioux, to whom we next took 
him, was less incredulous, and received the news without batting 
an eyelid. But I still cannot help wondering how long we should 
have had to wait for this piece of intelligence if our friend the 
lieutenant had not been lucky enough to be just on the spot at 
the right moment.<br><br>
But it would not be fair to confine these criticisms to the High 
Command. Generally speaking, the combatant troops were no 
more successful than the staff in adjusting their movements or 
their tactical appreciations to the speed at which the Germans 
moved. But failure in either case sprang from much the same 
causes. Not only was the passing on of information extremely 
inefficient, whether it emanated from lower or higher formations, 
but the front-line officers, though less highly trained, had, most 
of them, passed through the same process of professional 
education as their colleagues of the staff. From beginning to end of 
the campaign, the Germans showed the same embarrassing skill 
in appearing where they ought not to have appeared. They did 
not, in fact, play the game. When we were at Landrecies in the 
early spring, we set up a semi-permanent fuel park. This great 
idea, which had originated at G.H.Q., was conceived in terms of 
the kind of war which never, as things turned out, existed 
anywhere except on paper. One fine morning in May, the officer in 
charge ran into a column of tanks in the main street. They were, 
he thought, painted a very odd colour, but that did not worry 
him overmuch, because he could not possibly know all the 
various types in use in the French Army. But what did upset him 
considerably was the very curious route that they seemed to be 
taking! They were moving in the direction of Cambrai; in other 
words, away from the front. But that, too, could be explained 
without much difficulty, since it was only natural that in the 
<b>48</b> winding streets of a little town the guides might go wrong. He 
was just about to run after the commander of the convoy in order 
to put him right, when a casual passer-by, better informed than 
he was, shouted—’Look out! they’re Germans!’ <br><br>
It can be seen from what I have said that the war was a 
constant succession of surprises. The effect of this on morale seems 
to have been very serious. And here I must touch on a delicate 
subject. I have no right to do more than record impressions 
which are those only of a looker-on. But there are some things 
that must be said, even at the risk of hurting a good many 
feelings. Men are so made that they will face expected dangers in 
expected places a great deal more easily than the sudden 
appearance of deadly peril from behind a turn in the road which 
they have been led to suppose is perfectly safe. Years ago, 
shortly after the Battle of the Marne, I saw men who the day 
before had gone into the line under murderous fire without 
turning a hair, run like rabbits just because three shells fell quite 
harmlessly on a road where they had piled arms in order to furnish 
a water-fatigue. ‘We cleared out because the Germans came.’ 
Again and again I heard that said in the course of last May and 
June. Analysed, the words mean no more than this: ‘Because 
the Germans turned up where we didn’t expect them and where 
we had never been told we ought to expect them.’ Consequently, 
certain breakdowns, which cannot, I fear, be denied, occurred 
mainly because men had been trained to use their brains too 
slowly. Our soldiers were defeated and, to some extent, let 
themselves be too easily defeated, principally because their minds 
functioned far too sluggishly.<br><br><br><br>
Not only did we meet the enemy too often in unexpected 
places, but for the most part, especially, and with increasing 
frequency, <i>in a way</i> which neither the High Command nor, as a 
result, the rank and file had anticipated. We should have been 
<b>49</b> perfectly prepared to spend whole days potting at one another 
from entrenched positions, even if the lines had been only a few 
yards apart as they were in the Argonne during the last war. It 
would have seemed to us the most natural thing in the world to 
carry out raids on occupied saps. It would have been well 
within our capacity to stand firm in face of an assault through a 
curtain of wire more or less cut by ‘Minenwerfer’, or to have gone 
over the top courageously in an attempt to rush a position that 
had already been flattened—though, as a rule, not very 
completely—by artillery fire. In short, we could have played our 
part without difficulty in operations beautifully planned by our 
own staff and the enemy’s, if only they had been in accordance 
with the well-digested lessons learned at peace-time manœuvres. 
It was much more terrifying to find ourselves suddenly at grips 
with a section of tanks in open country. The Germans took no 
account of roads. They were everywhere. They felt their way 
forward, stopping whenever they ran up against serious 
resistance. Where, however, the resistance was not serious and they 
could find a ‘soft spot’, they drove ahead, exploiting their gains, 
and using them as a basis from which to develop the appropriate 
tactical movement or, rather, as it seemed, to take their choice 
of a number of alternative possibilities already envisaged in 
accordance with that methodical opportunism which was so 
characteristic of Hitler’s methods. They relied on action and on 
improvisation. We, on the other hand, believed in doing nothing 
and in behaving as we always had behaved.<br><br>
Nothing could better illustrate all this than the final episodes 
of the campaign in which I took a personal part. That was the 
time at which it really did seem as though we were beginning to 
profit by the lessons of experience. A decision was taken to 
group the forces which were in retreat from Normandy and 
were already cut off by the enemy advance west of Paris from 
the armies which had fallen back on the Loire, and with them 
to hold Brittany. Well, what happened? A thoroughly reliable 
<b>50</b> general of engineers was hurriedly sent to reconnoitre a ‘position’ 
with both flanks resting on the sea. It was unthinkable to a staff 
that we should put up any kind of resistance without first plotting 
on the map and then pegging out on the ground a fine continuous 
‘line’ complete with switches, forward positions, battle zones, 
and all the rest of it. True, we had neither the time available to 
organize such a system, guns with which to equip the various 
strong-points, or ammunition for those guns even supposing 
that we had found them. The result of all this was that after a 
few bursts of machine-gun fire, exchanged, I believe, at Fougères, 
the Germans entered Rennes (which our great defence system 
had been designed to cover) without fighting, swarmed over 
the peninsula, and took hordes of prisoners.<br><br>
Is it true to say that by then—the precise moment at which 
Pétain announced that he had asked for an armistice—all hope 
of resistance had become impossible? Several officers thought 
not, especially the younger officers, for, with the quickened pace 
of events, a wider gulf began to show between the generations. 
Unfortunately, our leaders were not drawn from among those 
who suffered least from a hardening of the arteries. I am still 
strongly of the opinion to-day that what we called, in 1918, our 
‘last-ditchers’ were right. They dreamed of a modern type of 
warfare waged by guerrillas against tanks and motorized detachments. 
Some of them, if I am not wrong, had drawn up plans for such a 
war, plans which will never now see the light of day. The 
motorcyclists, of whom the enemy made such extensive and such 
excellent use, could move rapidly, and without too many 
accidents, only on metalled roads. Even vehicles equipped with 
caterpillar treads proceed less slowly on macadamized highways 
than across open country, and mobile guns and tractors of the 
normal type must have a good hard surface on which to manœuvre. 
That is why the Germans, true to their doctrine of speed, tended 
more and more to move their shock elements along the main 
arteries. It was, therefore, absolutely unnecessary to cover our 
<b>51</b> front with a line extending for hundreds of kilometres, almost 
impossible to man, and terribly easy to pierce. On the other 
hand, the invader might have been badly mauled by a few islands 
of resistance well sited along the main roads, adequately 
camouflaged, sufficiently mobile, and armed with a few machine-guns 
and anti-tank artillery, or even with the humble 75! In Rennes 
I saw a German column, composed for the most part of 
motorcyclists, moving unopposed down the Boulevard Sévigné, and 
all the old instincts of the foot-slogger stirred in me. But I could 
do nothing, because the only men available were a few orderly- 
room clerks and storekeepers, who, from the earliest days of the 
war, had been, quite ridiculously, kept unarmed. I was badly 
tempted, all the same, to lie in wait for that damned column at 
the corner of some spinney of the Breton country-side, which is 
so admirably suited by nature for the mounting of ambushes, 
even if we had nothing to fight with but the sparse equipment 
of an engineer detachment. Once we had produced confusion 
in the enemy ranks, it would have been easy enough for us to 
melt into the ‘wild’, and then repeat the same performance 
farther on. I am quite certain that three-quarters of the men 
would have jumped at the chance of playing a game like that. 
But, alas, the regulations had never envisaged such a possibility.<br><br><br><br>
Naturally enough, this high-speed type of warfare demands 
a certain specialized equipment. The Germans saw to it that 
such equipment was available: we, on the other hand, did not, 
or only in insufficient quantities. It has been said, not once but 
again and again, that we were short of tanks, aeroplanes, guns, 
motor vehicles, and tractors, and that, consequently, we were 
never, from the very beginning of hostilities, in a position to 
fight as we ought to have fought. All this is, unfortunately, true 
enough, and it is equally true that the causes of this lamentable 
and fatal policy were not, all of them, wholly military. About 
<b>52</b> that I shall have something to say later. The faults of some do 
not, however, excuse those of others, and it would be highly 
unbecoming in the High Command to put in a plea of 
‘Innocent’.[1]<br><br>
Let us, if we like, condemn the strategic blunders which 
compelled our troops in the Nord Department either to abandon 
to the enemy, or to jettison on the Flanders beaches, the 
equipment of three motorized divisions, several regiments of mobile 
artillery, and all the tanks belonging to one of our armies. This 
material would have come in mighty handy on the battlefields 
of the Somme or the Aisne, for never had the nation in arms been 
better ‘found’. But I am not for the moment concerned with that. 
I want, rather, to consider the preparations that were made before 
war broke out. If we were short of tanks, aeroplanes, and 
tractors, it was mainly because we had put our not inexhaustible 
supplies of money and labour into concrete. But even so, we had 
not been wise enough to erect enough of it on our northern 
frontier, which is just as much open to attack as our eastern. And 
why? Because we had been taught to put our whole trust in the 
Maginot Line—constructed at vast expense and with much 
blowing of trumpets—only to see it turned, and even pierced, on the 
Rhine for the simple reason that it had been allowed to stop 
short on our left flank (but about that astonishing incident of 
the crossing of the Rhine I know only what the newspapers told 
us, which was precisely nothing at all) because, at the last 
<b>53</b> moment, a hurried decision was taken to construct a number of 
concrete block-houses in the Department of the Nord, which, 
since they were designed with only a frontal field of fire, were 
taken from behind, with the result that our men had to expend all 
their efforts on digging a magnificent anti-tank ditch covering 
Cambrai and Saint-Quentin—which the Germans overran one 
fine day by the simple expedient of advancing against it from 
those two places; because the doctrine then current among our 
military theorists laid it down that we had reached one of those 
moments in the history of strategy when the power of defensive 
armour to resist is greater than the power of gun-fire to pierce— 
in other words, when the fortified position is practically 
impregnable—though, unfortunately, the High Command lacked 
the courage, when the decisive moment came, to remain loyal to 
a theory which would, at least, have condemned the Belgian 
adventure even before it had started; because many of our 
military pundits were profoundly suspicious of armoured units, 
judging them too heavy to be moved easily (and their rate of 
progress as shown in official statistics was, it is true, very slow, 
but only because it was assumed that they must move by night— 
for security reasons—whereas, as things turned out, the war of 
speed was conducted almost uniformly by day); because those 
attending the Cavalry courses at the Staff College had had it 
drilled into them that, though tanks might be tolerably useful in 
defence, their value for attack was nil; because our technical 
experts—or those who passed for such—were of the opinion 
that bombardment by artillery was far superior to bombing from 
the air, oblivious of the fact that ammunition for guns has to be 
brought up over great distances, while the rate at which 
aeroplanes can be replenished is limited only by the speed of their 
flight; because, to sum up, our leaders, blind to the many 
contradictions inherent in their attitude, were mainly concerned to 
renew in 1940 the conditions of the war they had waged in 
1914-18.<br><br>
<b>54</b> The Germans, on the contrary, had been thinking in terms 
of 1940.[l]<br><br><br>
The story goes that Hitler, before drawing up his final plans 
for the campaign, summoned a number of psychologists to his 
headquarters and asked their advice. I cannot vouch for the 
truth of this, but it does not seem to be altogether beyond the 
bounds of probability. However that may be, the air offensive, 
conducted with such dash by the Germans, does seem to prove 
that they had gone very deeply into the whole question of nerves 
and the best way of breaking them. Nobody who has ever heard 
the whistling scream made by dive-bombers before releasing 
their load is ever likely to forget the experience. It is not only 
that the strident din made by the machines terrifies the victim 
by awakening in his mind associated images of death and 
destruction. In itself, and by reason of what I may call its strictly 
acoustic qualities, it can so work upon the nerves that they become 
wrought to a pitch of intolerable tension whence it is a very 
short step to panic. There is good evidence that these noises 
were deliberately intensified by various mechanical means. Aerial 
bombardment as developed by the Germans is never primarily 
designed as a method of spreading massacre and material 
desolation. No matter how thickly bombs may be sown, they never, 
in fact, register hits on more than a relatively small number of 
men. But the effect of bombing on the nerves is far-reaching, and 
<b>55</b> can break the potential of resistance over a large area. It was 
doubtless with that end in view that the enemy High Command 
sent wave after wave of bombers to attack us. The result came 
up only too well to their expectations.<br><br>
Once again I find myself constrained to deal with a subject on 
which even to touch—so far, at least, as this war is concerned— 
gives me an acute feeling of discomfort. Only those who have 
shared with their comrades the existence of the front line have 
any right to speak about danger, courage, and the hesitancies 
that afflict even the brave. I realize that. All the same, I am going 
to relate one small experience of my own, and without mincing 
words. I underwent my baptism of fire in 1940 (my earlier 
baptism of 1914 took place at the Marne) on 22 May on a road 
in Flanders—for I do not count the bombing of Douai and of 
the environs of Lens, in neither of which was I closely concerned. 
On the morning of the day in question, the convoy of which my 
car formed part was first machine-gunned from the air and then 
bombed. The machine-gunning, though it killed a man quite 
close to me, left me more or less unmoved. Of course, it is never 
very pleasant to be within touching-distance of death, and I do 
not mind admitting that I was a good deal relieved when the 
storm of bullets passed. But all through that particular episode 
my uneasiness had been much more a matter of intellect than of 
instinct. It was a sort of <i>cold</i> fear, with nothing in it of the quality 
of genuine <i>terror</i>. The bombing attack, so far as I am aware, 
killed no one, or no one who was anywhere near me. 
Nevertheless, it left me profoundly shaken, and when I crept out of the 
ditch where I had been crouching I was trembling pretty badly. 
During the latter part of the campaign I came under a number of 
artillery bombardments. I have known worse, and should be 
the last to exaggerate their violence. Still, they were quite nasty 
enough. But I stood up to them without much difficulty, and I 
think I can say that they never made me lose my presence of 
mind. But under air bombing I was never able to retain anything 
<b>56</b> like the same calmness except by making a very considerable 
effort of will.<br><br>
It is true, of course, that my reflexes had, to some extent, been 
conditioned. Ever since my Argonne experiences of 1914 the 
whine of bullets had become stamped on the grey matter of my 
brain as on the wax of a gramophone record, so that the mere 
turning of the handle would start that particular tune playing: 
nor were my ears so faultily constructed as to have lost, in rather 
less than a quarter of a century, the art they had learned of 
guessing the trajectory of a shell and judging its probable point of 
impact. My experiences of air bombardment had been far less 
frequent. Faced by that particular danger I was about as green 
as the youngest recruit among us. Still, the difference in emotional 
‘temperature’ of the three kinds of experience I have been 
describing was so general to all of us that I am forced to the 
conclusion that its cause lay deeper than can be accounted for by 
the nature of my own private reactions. Admittedly, the almost 
complete absence of our own fighters from the sky above our 
heads, and the deplorable immunity thus enjoyed by the enemy 
bombers played no small part in lowering the morale of the 
troops. But these things do not wholly explain what happened.<br><br>
Air bombing is probably, in itself, no more actually dangerous 
than many other kinds of peril to which the soldier is exposed— 
or not, at any rate, in open country. When men are caught 
inside houses, the collapse of walls and the atmospheric 
concussion consequent upon any explosion in a confined space 
always result in a high death-roll. In the open, on the other hand, 
artillery fire, even when fairly widely distributed, accounts for at 
least as many victims, while machine-gunning is without parallel 
as a method of slaughter, since it literally spares no one. From 
the moment the campaign opened, we had been struck by the 
relatively small number of losses attributable to enemy 
aeroplanes, though the reports of their activity reaching us from the 
front were very highly coloured.<br><br>
<b>57</b> No, the fact is that this dropping of bombs from the sky has 
a unique power of spreading terror. They are dropped from a 
great height, and seem, though quite erroneously, to be falling 
straight on top of one’s head. The combination of weight and 
altitude gives them an appearance of almost visible violence 
which no shelter, however thick, seems capable of resisting. 
There is something inhuman about the nature of the trajectory 
and the sense of power. Exposed to this unleashing of 
destruction, the soldier cowers as under some cataclysm of nature, and 
is tempted to feel that he is utterly defenceless—though, in 
reality, if one dives into a ditch or even throws oneself flat on 
the ground, one is pretty safe from the bursts, which are generally 
a good deal less effective than those of shells, always ruling out, 
of course, the effects of a direct hit. One has, whether under air 
or artillery bombardment, what old soldiers call ‘pretty good 
elbow room’. The noise is hateful, savage, and excessively nerve- 
racking, both that of the descending ‘whistle’ (deliberately 
accentuated) about which I have already spoken, and that of the 
actual burst, which shakes every bone in one’s body. It seems to 
crush the very air with unparalleled violence, and conjures up 
pictures of torn flesh which are only too horribly borne out in 
fact by the sights one sees. It is not only that the bodies are 
terribly mangled. The effect of escaping gases adds to the 
appalling nature of the spectacle. A man is always scared of 
dying, but particularly so when to death is added the threat of 
complete physical disintegration. No doubt this is a peculiarly 
illogical manifestation of the instinct of self-preservation, but its 
roots are very deep in human nature. Had the war lasted longer, 
it is probable that our men would have acquired, in this matter 
of aerial bombardment, some of the contempt bred of familiarity 
without which no one can stand up to danger effectively. Reason 
would have convinced them that, no matter how terrible it might 
be, its material effects were no worse than those of other forms 
of attack.<br><br>

<b>58</b> In a war of which speed was the one essential, it was of the 
first importance that we should be able to gauge our enemy’s 
psychology accurately. But what a roar of laughter there would 
have been had somebody so much as suggested to the General 
Staff that it might be well to pay some attention to a few old 
cranks who happened to be experts in the art of measuring 
sensations!<br><br>
To what extent is it justifiable to speak of there having been 
an absence of ‘order’ in the various staffs? Quite apart from the 
fact that habits of work varied from group to group or general 
to general, one should be very careful indeed about employing 
such a phrase. There is more than one kind of order, and, 
therefore, more than one kind of its ‘lack’. All the staffs on which I 
ever worked had, to an almost morbid degree, the passion for 
‘paper’. Writing had to be very neat. The style of expression 
had to be in accordance with an inflexible tradition. In the 
preparation of statistical tables the figures had to be alined as 
regularly as soldiers on parade. All files had to be carefully 
docketed, and all incoming and outgoing correspondence 
properly registered. From such details is built ‘order’ in the 
bureaucratic sense. It was only natural that it should flourish 
among men who had received, in time of peace, what amounted 
to an intensive bureaucratic training. Far be it from me to despise 
such things. A properly organized routine compels men to 
express themselves lucidly and saves a great deal of time. But it 
is a pity that this admirable concern for cleanliness in paper-work 
should not always be extended to the <i>places</i> in which that work 
is done. I have never seen a dirtier or more fetid interior than 
that of a certain headquarters office in the fortified zone. Any 
company-sergeant-major who had permitted in his barrack- 
rooms even half the quantity of dust that covered our tables and 
filled our cupboards would very soon have lost his stripes. True, 
I have known ante-rooms of ministers, whom no one could have 
accused of aping the military, which were scarcely more attractive. 
<b>59</b> But that is no excuse. Some people may think that I am over- 
stressing trivial details. I have, I admit, a strong dislike of 
slovenliness. It is infectious, and easily worms its way into the 
mind. To get rid of it would be an admirable reform, and I 
commend it to the attention of those who are concerned with 
putting our national house in order.<br><br>
There was, however, another side to the praiseworthy paper 
routine of our military staffs. It led to a waste of energy which 
might have been much better employed in other directions. 
Among my fellow reservists were a number of senior civil 
servants and directors of big private concerns. They were all, 
like myself, amazed at having to spend their time doing the kind 
of office work which, in civil life, they would have entrusted to 
very junior clerks. When I was in charge of fuel supplies at 
Army H.Q. I had to give every evening over a period of months 
to entering up the figures of my daily issues. I took as little time 
over it as possible, and soon grew expert in a species of 
arithmetical acrobatics, though at first, I confess, I did find that I was 
a bit out of practice. But once the general lines of our peculiar 
form of accountancy had been laid down, any clerk could have 
done the work just as well. Nor was my case exceptional. The 
question of ‘secrecy’ did not enter into the matter at all, because 
my rough drafts were always copied out later by a private soldier. 
Besides, a few minutes spent in nosing round our offices, which 
were plastered with maps showing the location of all munition 
dumps, fuel depots, and rail-heads in the Army area, would have 
given much precious information to any spy who might have 
succeeded in passing himself off as one of the clerical staff. The 
fact of the matter is that the headquarters organizations of the 
French Army resembled business houses with departmental 
managers—represented by the officers—at the top, stenographers 
at the bottom, and, in between, nothing at all. It would have 
been the simplest thing in the world to recruit a number of 
highly qualified ‘confidential clerks’ from N.C.O.s of the reserve. 
<b>60</b> It is a bad thing for men who have to carry a heavy load of 
responsibility, who ought to keep their sense of initiative keen, 
to be constantly kept back by the need of performing purely 
mechanical tasks. If, too, the staffs had been better supplied with 
N.C.O.s, it would probably have been possible, at least where 
the anxieties of the fighting front were not too pressing, to have 
released a number of officers for more useful employment 
elsewhere.<br><br>

But how was it that on many of us, and particularly, I gather, 
on regimental officers, the staff formation produced an undeniable 
impression of disorder as soon as the war entered its active phase? 
The explanation may, I think, be found in the fact that the static 
order of office routine is, in many respects, the very antithesis of 
the active and perpetually inventive ‘order’ which movement 
demands. One is a matter of discipline and training, the other 
of imaginative realism, adaptable intelligence, and, above all, of 
character. The two kinds are not mutually exclusive, but the 
first does not necessarily imply the second, and often, unless 
great care is taken, is a bad school for it. All through that long 
period of waiting which wrought such havoc in our armies, the 
peace-time habits of neatness and order, of which we were so 
proud, had the effect of slowing down the tempo of our lives. 
When we were suddenly called upon to act swiftly, our leaders, 
more often than not, mistook feverish activity for quick decision.<br><br>
Keeping a lot of routine papers in order does not call for much 
mental effort. Quite a different sort of self-mastery is required 
when it becomes a question of drawing up, well in advance and 
with the maximum of elasticity, plans which may have to wait a 
long time before they are put in action, and may, at the last 
moment, have to be adapted to the needs of a chaotic situation. 
My first experience of the machinery of mobilization in 1939 gave 
me a bad headache. I will not discuss here the system of depots 
which was substituted after the last war for the old corps 
organizations. I know that the scheme met with a good deal of 
<b>61</b> hostile criticism, some of it at a high level. It seemed to me bound, 
by its very nature, to produce delays and difficulties. Most of 
the clothing and equipment was still being supplied by the 
various corps, and in order to get all this material to the Intake 
Depots, a whole system of transport, unsuitable in form and 
necessarily slow in movement, had to be organized. Nobody 
seemed to have realized that the fitting out of reservists of forty 
with uniforms made for young conscripts, or the handling of 
heavy requisitioned draught-horses with the discarded harness 
of a cavalry stable, meant saddling the wretched depots, whether 
‘main’ or ‘secondary’, with problems which were, in themselves, 
quite incapable of solution. The work, too, involved much 
niggling detail, and, quite often, was entrusted to the wrong type 
of person. I do not mean to say that I have not come across 
several highly competent depot commanders: I have. But I have 
also had experience of a great many who were far from 
competent—captains and colonels due for pension, who had all the 
faults commonly attributed to the regular N.C.O. Once the new 
system had been adopted it should, in view of the difficulties that 
were bound to arise, have been operated by carefully selected 
men, and should have ranked high in the list of ‘seniorities’ when 
promotion came to be considered. Army circles always find it 
difficult to realize that the ‘showiness’ of a job has nothing 
whatever to do with its importance, or that those engaged in what 
seem to be very humble tasks are often just as deserving of 
recognition as their more fortunate fellows.<br><br>
But whether the system of Recruit Depots was good or bad— 
and I have no doubt that it has many advantages—it cannot 
excuse the mistakes that occurred, which had nothing to do with 
the general principle. No officer, I think, who was called upon 
to do duty with one of these regional organizations, or with a 
Subdivisional Area Group, will ever remember without a wry 
smile the incredible tangle of ‘measures’, all duly numbered, 
which were supposed to be taken during the so-called ‘Alert 
<b>62</b> Period’ preceding actual mobilization. Dragged from one’s bed 
in the middle of the night by a telegram which might read, for 
instance, ‘Measure 81 to come into force immediately’, one would 
rush to the code-card which was always kept handy, only to find 
that ‘Measure 81’ involved the implementation of all clauses 
contained in ‘Measure 49’ with the exception of such of them as 
might have been already set in motion by the application of 
‘Measure 93’—should the latter happen to have come into force 
earlier than its numerical place in the series seemed to warrant, 
and that, in any case, the two first paragraphs of ‘Measure 57’ 
must also be acted upon. I pick on these numbers at random, 
and am not prepared, at this distance of time, to say that they are 
accurate. Those with whom I worked will, I think, agree that 
I have shown the whole business as being a good deal simpler 
than it actually was. Can one wonder that in such circumstances 
mistakes were of frequent occurrence? For instance, as a result 
of not reading instructions with sufficient care, the police 
authorities of Alsace-Lorraine proceeded, in September 1939, to 
carry out a premature massacre of all the carrier-pigeons of three 
departments. I do not say that the officers sitting far away in 
Paris, in a dark little office of the rue Saint-Dominique, adding 
figure to figure until the result was like a Chinese puzzle, were 
necessarily lacking in imagination. It was only that their 
particular type of imagination was not calculated to give them a clear 
idea of what it would mean to carry out their orders.<br><br>
But that was far from being the worst of many errors. I know 
of one depot in Strasbourg, situated close to the river-bank, 
which was well within range of the enemy’s light artillery, and 
even of his machine-guns. Another had been established in one 
of the neighbouring forts which was also within easy reach of 
the Rhine. It could be approached only by one bridge laid 
across the defensive ditch. A single well-placed bomb or shell 
would have turned the place into a death-trap. Nothing of the 
kind, I shall be told, did in fact happen. Agreed. But how could 
<b>63</b> we be sure beforehand that the Germans would not fire on 
Strasbourg? The truth of the matter is that this particular 
arrangement was perfectly all right so long as the bridgehead at 
Kehl was a demilitarized area. Unfortunately, when it ceased to 
be so, the High Command forgot to modify its arrangements, or 
did not modify them sufficiently.<br><br>

I must say something too about the appalling confusion which 
marked the one piece of mobilization of which I had personal 
experience. It concerned the calling-up of certain territorial 
elements which came for orders under a Subdivisional Area 
Group. When our general took over his command we discovered 
with horrified amazement that there was no list of the units of 
which it was to be composed. We had to improvise one as best 
we could—and it was a poor best—by dint of hunting our way 
through a chaotic mass of files. As a result, the most frightful 
confusion reigned within each unit, and they were all mixed up 
anyhow. In one part of our zone we had two sections under 
command of an officer who belonged to a totally different group, 
and in another several companies but no colonel. Our splendid 
lines-of-communication troops consisted of elderly men whose 
willingness was equalled only by their ingenuity in making the 
best of a bad job. Very few of them had a sound pair of boots, 
but none of them, by the grace of God, actually died of hunger. 
How one section which I spent a whole day trying to find on 
the main line to Saint-Dié managed to live at all, I shall never 
know. It is not fair, I admit, to argue from the particular to the 
general. I have good reason to believe that the mobilization in 
our little corner of France had not been very well planned. The 
senior officer in charge had little to show for his staff training but 
a certain easy-going irresponsibility, and most of the work was 
actually done by his juniors. This, admittedly, was only a 
solitary instance, but it gave cause for grave disquiet. By 1940 
we realized that a good many mistakes had been put right, but 
not all of them by any means. The depots had not been moved, 
<b>64</b> and the lines-of-communication troops still tramped the 
permanent way in sandals or light walking shoes, unless they 
happened to have furnished themselves with stouter footwear.<br><br>
One did not need to be possessed of extraordinary gifts of 
observation at First Army H.Q. to realize, during the months 
preceding May 1940, that a number of alarming cracks had 
developed in the military fabric. They were not, in themselves, 
very dangerous, but it was easy to see that, should a crisis 
suddenly develop, they might split wide open and let in the flood. 
One of them was the wholly inadequate organization of our 
communications.<br><br>
I have no personal grouse in this matter. Throughout the 
campaign I was able, without difficulty, to communicate with 
the various sections of my Fuel-Supply group, and always 
managed to work smoothly enough with the different units for 
whose needs I had to cater. Lachamp’s intelligent unselfishness 
was of the greatest possible assistance to me. Naturally, I was 
careful, wherever possible, not to trespass on his prerogatives as 
my senior officer. In fact, he exercised them with such 
competence and authority that I was never once tempted to call his 
decisions in question. It was agreed between us that, since I was 
closer to the fountain-head of information than he was, I must 
always, in cases of real urgency, pass on Army Orders directly 
to subordinate formations. This system of by-passing saved us, 
on more than one occasion, a great deal of time.[1] We were both 
of us obsessed, as a result of our experiences during the former
<b>65</b> war, by blind terror of the frightful games of blind-man’s-buff 
which inevitably occur where systems of communication are 
inadequately organized. No matter how constant the moves 
forced upon H.Q. and the Supply Park, we always knew where 
to find both. Though nothing was ever put down on paper, we 
managed, between us, to develop an internal system by which 
we could always be sure of passing on urgent instructions.<br><br>
I always had in my office two motor-cyclists—one supplied 
by each of the companies of the mobile supply column. Both of 
them knew, well in advance of any movement, where their 
companies would be located, and where they could find the senior 
supply officer. In addition, one of Lachamp’s own officers was 
permanently attached to me. Four other supply officers served 
as links with the corps. Each of them, regularly once a day and 
sometimes oftener, visited both Army H.Q. and the corps to 
which he himself belonged. These grand chaps, some of them 
not by any means in their first youth, had a pretty hard time of 
it travelling roads that were often far from safe. One of them, at 
the time of our first withdrawal after the advance into Belgium, 
spent more than twenty-four hours trying to find his Corps 
H.Q. They could always be relied upon to arrive sooner or later 
at the point they were making for, and we found them 
extraordinarily useful. Never once between 11 and 31 May, when it 
was a question of sending orders or receiving requests for 
supplies, did I have to use the official channels through which the 
staff was supposed to communicate with subordinate units. 
Subsequent events proved beyond question that both orders 
and requests had reached their destination. Never once, so far 
as I know, did the fighting troops run short of petrol which our 
‘Mickeys’ (this was the Army nickname for the mobile tanks with 
their gay little distinguishing mark of a Mickey Mouse) so 
heroically delivered, often over considerable distances. Nor did 
we ever abandon to the enemy any of our depots in a fit state to 
operate. The whole line of our retreat from Mons to Lille was 
<b>66</b> lit by more fires than can ever have been kindled by Attila. 
Lachamp and his officers saw to it that can after can went into 
the flames till the last drop was consumed. The only exception 
to this general rule was the fuel depot at Saint-Quentin. So 
rapidly and so completely did we lose touch with it that I do not 
know, to this day, what happened there. Our seniors, realizing 
by experience that all was going well, soon decided to give us 
a free hand—for which consideration on their part I am duly 
grateful.<br><br>
But I am very much afraid that where this sort of 
self-government and mutual understanding did not exist, contacts between 
units and their senior formations, or, on the same level, between 
one unit and another, left a good deal to be desired. I have more 
than once heard regimental officers complain that they were left 
too long without orders, and it is very certain—as I have already 
shown by citing notorious examples—that the staff was 
imperfectly informed about what was happening on their section 
of the front. When roads are crowded, as ours soon became, 
particularly by refugees, the motor-cycle is the only vehicle that 
can make any progress at all. I think I am right in saying that 
Army Signals did not have a single one of these machines. Even 
the number of cars available was insufficient, and what there 
were were badly allotted. Not a few of us had been profoundly 
disturbed, ever since the winter, by this state of affairs which 
arose from faulty organization and control. But no one bothered 
to set it to rights, and the evil effects became only too apparent 
in the course of the campaign.<br><br>
It must be remembered that, almost as soon as active 
operations began, Army H.Q. moved from Bohain to Valenciennes 
so as to reduce the distance separating it from the troops moving 
into Belgium. As soon as I arrived at Valenciennes in the early 
afternoon of the nth, I arranged to go straight on to Mons in 
order to consult with local Belgian H.Q. about the 
requisitioning of fuel supplies. It can scarcely be denied that the matter 
<b>67</b> was one of supreme urgency. I discovered that, owing to the 
fact that all available transport had been formed into a shuttle- 
service between old and new H.Q. for the purposes of the move, 
it would be quite impossible for me to proceed. What was the 
use of my having left Bohain if I could not get forward? Luckily, 
I was visited during the day by a friendly lawyer of Lille who 
was acting as adjutant to the commander of a supply group. He 
had come to beg me for some petrol. With some degree of 
cynicism I replied: ‘Nothing for nothing: no petrol unless you 
get me a car!’ The bargain was struck, and I set off for Mons at 
last. The lesson was a salutary one, and I immediately set about 
arranging my own system of communications along the lines I 
have already described.<br><br>
It would have been a miracle indeed if orders had reached their 
intended recipients in time, seeing that only too often Army had 
no idea where its corps were situated. On one occasion, when 
the Cavalry Corps had done a move, the supply liaison officer 
set off, as usual, to make contact with those privileged customers. 
When he got back I took him along to Intelligence, thinking it 
as well to make sure that our great tacticians really did know 
where the new H.Q. was to be found. It then appeared that there 
was a difference amounting to thirty kilometres between the 
actual spot and the one they had pencilled in on their maps. I 
can still hear the very grudging ‘thanks’ which was the reward 
for our intervention. Some time later I wanted Lachamp to go 
to British H.Q. The occasion was an important one, having no 
less an object than to arrange for the destruction of the Lille 
dumps. But where on earth was Lord Gort’s H.Q.? Crossing 
once again the awe-inspiring threshold of Intelligence, I asked. 
B . . . replied, without batting an eyelid, that they had no idea. 
I was fortunate enough to be able to lay my hands on a chit that 
was going the rounds in which that piece of information, along 
with others of a like nature, was contained. Our friends were 
less ill informed than they thought! But the fact that the officer 
<b>68</b> in charge of operations could tolerate for a single moment the 
idea of being deprived, for want of an elementary piece of 
topographical information, of all means of communicating with the 
headquarters of Allied troops supposed to be working on our 
left flank, and could calmly admit to an ignorance which he was, 
in fact, in a position to dissipate, throws an ugly light on our 
methods of work.<br><br><br><br>

And now that I have touched on the subject of ‘The English’, 
I feel bound to ask whether we ever really got our co-operation 
with them properly organized. Never was the fatal insufficiency 
of our ‘liaison’, in the fullest sense of that term, more crudely 
shown up.<br><br>
But the whole problem of an alliance that turned out so ill is 
too complicated, and has already given rise to too much heated 
and ill-natured argument, to be touched on in a mere aside. It 
is time that somebody had the courage, once and for all, to come 
to grips with it. This I intend to do, so far, that is, as my 
experience fits me for the task.<br><br>
I have many good friends in Great Britain. They have been 
the soul of hospitality, and have smoothed the way for me in 
my attempts to understand a civilization for which I have long 
felt a deep sympathy. To-day they are nearer than ever to my 
heart, for they, and their fellow countrymen, are shouldering, 
unaided and at imminent peril of their lives, the task of 
defending a cause for which I would gladly have died. Whether or not 
they will ever see what I am about to write, I cannot tell. If they 
do, they may well feel genuinely shocked. But lack of sincerity 
is not one of their national faults, and I can only hope that they 
will forgive my frankness.<br><br>
The anglophobia of many thousands of Frenchmen is to-day 
being exploited in the most despicable fashion. It is no manner 
of use to deny its existence. Its causes are many and various. 
Some are linked with historical memories which are tougher than 
<b>69</b> a good many people seem to think. The ghost of the ‘Maid’, the 
hateful figures of Pitt and Palmerston, have never altogether 
ceased to haunt a collective mind which is only too ready to 
remember the past. It might be a good thing if an old-established 
nation could forget more easily, because memory often distorts 
the image of the present, and the crying need of most men is that 
they should be able to adapt themselves to new conditions. There 
are other causes, too, which are more artificial and a great deal 
more blameworthy. The regular readers of a certain weekly, 
much enjoyed in Army circles, were told at the time of the Italian 
invasion of Ethiopia that it was our duty to ensure the 
‘destruction’ of England. The article was signed with what, to all 
appearances, was a French name. But who were its real 
instigators? We all know that they were no countrymen of ours. 
But there is more to it than that.<br><br>
It must, I think, be regarded as inevitable that two nations, so 
different as ours are—different in spite of having in common 
many of their most fundamental ideas—should find it very 
difficult to know, to understand, and, consequently, to love one 
another. This truth holds good on either side of the Channel, 
and I do not suppose that among average English people, 
especially of the lower middle class, the age-old prejudices against 
the ‘Frenchies’ opposite have even now ceased to flourish. Ours 
certainly have not. But it is not to be denied that certain episodes 
in the course of our recent, and all too short, fellowship in arms 
were not calculated to thin the fog of misunderstanding.<br><br>
The conscripted element counted for very little in the British 
forces which, during those long months of waiting, settled down 
with us on the plains of Flanders, lived in our villages, and policed 
our roads. Most of the men and officers were ‘regulars’, and they 
had, I am sure, all the excellences that one associates with 
professional soldiers—as well as some of their faults. The soldier 
immortalized by Kipling knows how to obey and how to fight. 
Once again he was to show his mettle when asked to shed his 
<b>70</b> blood on the battlefields of Belgium. But he is, by nature, a 
looter and a lecher: that is to say, he is guilty of two vices which 
the French peasant finds it hard to forgive when both are satisfied 
to the detriment of his farmyard and his daughters. Nor does 
the Englishman show to his best advantage when he is on the 
Continent—unless, that is, he belongs to the more educated 
classes. In his own country he is, as a rule, kindly and good- 
natured, but once across the Channel he tends to confuse his 
European hosts with ‘natives’—in other words, with those 
inhabitants of his colonial possessions who are, by definition, 
his ‘inferiors’. His natural shyness serves but to intensify his 
unfriendliness. These, I admit, are trivial matters when compared 
with the deep, underlying currents of feeling concerned with 
great national issues. No one, however, will, I think, deny that 
they weigh heavily in the scales with country people like ours 
who make a point of being suspicious of all foreigners and live 
within the close limits of their selfish interests.<br><br>
Then, after long and terrible weeks, came the moment of 
embarkation. I am not one of those who bitterly resent the fact 
that the British should have insisted on having priority in this 
matter, or should have refused, with very few exceptions, to let 
our men on to the ships before they had got the full complement 
of their own troops away from the beaches. Save for those of 
our men who were engaged in coastal defence, their own army 
was the nearest to the sea, and, naturally, they were not prepared 
to see their own personnel and material swallowed up in a 
disaster for which they did not hold themselves responsible. 
When the British ‘Tars’ had seen their own countrymen to 
safety, they turned their attention to ours. The spirit of self- 
sacrifice which they showed in the face of danger, and their 
kindliness, was no less when exercised on our behalf than it had 
been when they were dealing with their first consignment of 
passengers.<br><br>
But here again it is essential that we try to understand the 
<b>71</b> Frenchman’s inevitable reactions. Our men, deprived by their 
own leaders of the power to resist, had been desperately waiting 
on the long Flanders beaches, or among the dunes, for their last 
chance of escaping capture by the enemy, and long months of 
incarceration in the prisons of the Third Reich. With each day 
that passed they felt the Germans creeping closer, and each day 
were exposed to a growing violence of bombing. They knew 
well enough that not all of them would succeed in getting away, 
nor, in fact, did they. In such Circumstances they would have 
needed a superhuman dose of charity not to feel bitter as they 
saw ship after ship drawing away from the shore, carrying their 
foreign companions in arms to safety. Heroes they may have 
been, but they were not saints. Add to all this a number of 
irritating incidents which, though difficult to prevent in the state 
of nervous tension then existing, were bound to have a bad effect 
on men already suffering from intolerable strain. There was, for 
instance, the case—and I can vouch that it did really occur—of 
the French interpreter with an English brigade, who, after long 
months of intimate companionship in billets and on the 
battlefield, found himself left to his own devices on the sands, and 
forbidden to set foot on the ship which he saw steaming away with 
his former friends lining the rails. The touching kindness with 
which a great number of our men found themselves welcomed 
once they got across to England did much to heal these wounds. 
But it was not always in evidence. The welcome of the man in 
the street was invariably warm and affectionate; that of the 
authorities, on the other hand, was too often cold and 
needlessly suspicious. Certain transit camps had an almost penal air. 
Harassed troops are always difficult to handle. It is not to be 
wondered at that officials who were called upon to deal with a 
situation of considerable delicacy, and were obsessed by the need 
to keep discipline, should now and then have been guilty of 
clumsiness. But it is natural, too, that when such incidents 
occurred, they should leave lasting traces in men’s memories.<br><br>
<b>72</b> It has often been said that the British gave us insufficient 
assistance. This charge was made with the object of covering up 
our own failure, with the result that a good many of the figures 
quoted in its support were cooked. I have very good reason to 
know that the British had many more than three divisions in 
Flanders. Still, this pernicious propaganda did not have to rely 
altogether on falsifications.<br><br>
Those who have some knowledge of the political and social 
traditions of the English—which are so different from ours— 
realize that their adoption of the conscript method of enlistment 
was an act of great courage. It is difficult, however, to deny that 
this act of courage came rather late in the day, nor is it altogether 
surprising that Frenchmen between the ages of thirty and forty, 
finding themselves under fire, should sometimes have wondered 
why it was that their English contemporaries were allowed to 
remain safely at home. Great Britain has, since then, made up 
only too well in sacrifice for her tardiness in preparation. But 
who, at the time of the retreat, was in a position to see into the 
future? It is, too, beyond question that when our First Army 
was planning to launch a break-through offensive from the north, 
southwards towards Arras, in conjunction with French troops 
operating in the reverse direction from the Somme, British H.Q. 
countermanded, almost at the last moment, the assistance which 
it had already promised. This decision, as was but natural, sowed 
a plentiful harvest of resentment, nor was there any lack of those 
ready to exploit it. I am reminded, in this connexion, of 
something that happened a little later, at the time of the Belgian 
capitulation. When the news reached us, an Intelligence officer 
was heard to remark, sceptically, ‘<i>What</i> a chance for General 
Blanchard!’ We had, in fact, been surrounded for some 
considerable time before Leopold III surrendered, and the enemy 
encirclement was already half-way to completion when the British 
threw a spanner into the wheels of the projected offensive. What 
better excuse for our own failures than the mistakes of others? 
<b>73</b> We of the Northern Army had, finally, to give up any hope 
of breaking into the ‘German pocket’. The British refusal had 
certainly contributed to the collapse of that enterprise even before 
it developed. The form in which it came, however, was not very 
courteous. If, taking things at their worst, a sudden deterioration 
in the strategic situation had, in fact, made it impossible to give 
effect to the plan already decided upon, it would have been 
better if British Expeditionary Force G.H.Q. had not left the 
French High Command quite so long in a state of uncertainty. 
(But in this matter I have, naturally, heard only one side of the 
case—our own.) The British decision was probably a sound 
one.1 In any case, the historian, whose business it is to 
understand and not to judge, can explain it without much difficulty. 
At this point it becomes necessary to take a look at the other side 
of the medal.<br><br>
It took a long time to mount our own offensive towards the 
south. Preliminary reconnaissance, the assembly of the assault 
troops, the artillery preparation, in short, all the steps regarded as 
indispensable by current military theory, demanded a great deal 
of time. Zero hour had already been put back once. The 
operation envisaged was to have been a Battle of Malmaison in 
miniature. Whether the pace could have been quickened I do not know : 
probably not when the Army was holding a line that extended as 
far as the Escaut. What, however, I do know is that to move in 
this leisurely fashion meant running the risk of being anticipated 
by the enemy. By behaving as we did, we gave him every 
opportunity to strengthen what at first had been merely an 
advance-guard in the country between our Northern and Southern 
Armies, and, at the same time, to increase his pressure on the 
other fronts. Probably our allies, who, meanwhile, had been 
<b>74</b> violently attacked, saw the danger. They disengaged their troops 
so as not to be involved in the tactical disaster which they 
foresaw. They had fewer scruples in doing this because they were 
beginning to feel very impatient at our methods. This failure of 
confidence is, I think, the psychological explanation of their whole 
behaviour during the final fortnight of the campaign of Flanders. 
In the course of a few days we saw the thermometer of the 
alliance register a heavy fall. It is a matter of general knowledge 
that the British, from the very outset of hostilities, had accepted 
the principle of the single command, though admittedly the form 
it took was by no means complete, and involved many curious 
consequences. British G.H.Q. came under the orders of our 
Commander-in-Chief, but only directly. The result of this was 
that the general commanding our First Army Group, who was 
in charge of operations from the Ardennes to the sea, found that 
a not-inconsiderable body of troops over which he exercised no 
authority had been sandwiched in between the effectives for 
which he was responsible. At the same time, it must not be 
forgotten that the concession made by the London Government had 
had an irritating effect on British national pride, and, in particular, 
on the minds of the military which are particularly susceptible to 
offence. The decision was, no doubt, justified by the numerical 
preponderance of our land forces, which was overwhelming, 
though the prestige attaching to our military reputation for 
strategic brilliance had not a little to do with it. Foch, after the 
Conference of Doullens, had led the Allied armies to victory: 
it was to be expected that his successor would do the same. 
Certainly, French officers as a whole were convinced that our 
staff training was the best in the world, and I have a feeling that 
they may have been a little too vocal about it.[1] What happened 
<b>75</b> was that, in the course of a few days, the entirely unexpected 
collapse of our armies on the Meuse suddenly threatened all the 
elements farther to the north with encirclement. Faced by a 
disaster which might well have involved the loss of the whole of 
their Expeditionary Force, the British felt that they had a right 
to be consulted. Their faith in us had already been shaken. The 
slowness and ineffectiveness of our movements did the rest. Our 
prestige was a thing of the past, and our Allies made no bones 
about not concealing the fact. Can one blame them? 
When the projected Allied attack on Arras came to nothing, 
it seems that the two General Staffs, under the influence of mutual 
disenchantment, gave up almost entirely any further pretence of 
collaboration. Numerous must have been the bridges (though 
how numerous I do not know) which the British blew up to 
cover their retreat, without bothering to find out whether, by 
their action, they might not be cutting ours. Certainly, in spite 
of the protests of the engineer-in-charge, they prematurely 
destroyed the Lille telephone system, thereby depriving the 
First Army of practically all its means of intercommunication. 
We considered that they were acting without the slightest 
consideration for us, and I have no doubt that the very natural 
disappointment they felt at the failure of our High Command did 
lead some of them to forget at times what was owing to fighting 
soldiers whose courage had never been called in question. 
A clearer demarcation of the zones for which each army was 
responsible would probably have prevented a number of 
tiresome incidents from ever having developed at all. But there was 
no longer any authority capable of carrying through such a 
scheme. Up till then areas had been allotted by French G.H.Q. 
Some sort of friendly arrangement might have been possible. 
Whether it was ever attempted I cannot say. If it was, it had no 
success. Lille was a particularly sore point. Nobody knew under 
<b>76</b> whose authority it came. Until 10 May it had certainly been 
within the British zone: but it was there that the French First 
Army had carried out its final concentration. For some days it 
was the main source of our fuel supplies. When it became a 
question of immobilizing the dumps, we were quite determined 
not to leave the matter in the hands of our Allies. Their methods 
seemed to us to be entirely inadequate. They appeared to think 
that it was enough to put sugar or tar into the petrol. We 
preferred to burn it. When the problem was laid before General 
Prioux, he sent a letter and issued an order. The letter, which was 
addressed to Lord Gort, was interpreted as leaving the decision, 
in the politest possible way, to the latter. The order, on the 
contrary, which was circulated to personnel of the First Army 
assumed that the responsibility would be ours. This manner of 
solving the problem may have been diplomatically very subtle, 
but it threw a harsh light on the prevailing uncertainty in regard 
to the rights of the two armies. The state of confusion continued 
up to the very last moment. Only one dump escaped being fired. 
It was situated on the far bank of the canal. The British had 
already destroyed the bridges and, for some reason unknown to 
me, refused to allow anybody to cross by boat. Who was 
responsible for all this chaos? To some extent, probably, the 
British, though our excessive readiness to accept the situation 
makes it impossible for us to plead not guilty.<br><br>
But I am convinced that the breakdown of morale would have 
been far less total, and would have had consequences a great deal 
less grave, had our contact with our Allies been, in the first place, 
more firmly established. Admittedly, it was all very complicated. 
Lord Gort’s Staff performed a double function, acting both as 
G.H.Q. British Expeditionary Force and as the H.Q. of an Army. 
As the first of these it was in direct contact with our own 
Commander-in-Chief, who maintained a French Mission at Lord 
Gort’s H.Q. under the command of General Voruz, who was 
present as his representative. As the second it was, or should 
<b>77</b> have been, in constant and close touch with the Seventh Army 
on its left in the coastal area and with the First on its right. Here 
the French Mission had no standing at all, and it was up to the 
armies themselves to see that contact did not break down. What 
happened was that, during the period of waiting, dealings between 
them were reduced, for the most part, to unimportant questions 
relating to zone limitation. But it should have been perfectly 
obvious that, once active operations began, far more urgent 
problems would come up for settlement, and that their 
successful solution would depend very largely on the means taken earlier 
to establish mutual collaboration and the sharing of all relevant 
information. Things turned out, in fact, far worse than anyone 
had anticipated, because French G.H.Q. having vanished entirely 
from our field of vision as a result of the German movement of 
encirclement, the only practical system of communication between 
the British and ourselves was at Army level.<br><br>
It will be remembered that I had originally been appointed to 
act as liaison officer with the British. During our first weeks at 
Bohain I did my best to carry out my duties in that capacity. No 
one interfered with me, though no one did much to help me. 
Later, when I had been put in charge of fuel supplies, I still 
continued my efforts to establish a workable basis of mutual 
understanding. On my visits to the British—whose G.H.Q. 
was at that time dispersed, for reasons of security, in a number 
of wretched villages round Arras—I found myself having most 
to do with ‘Q Branch’.[1] In addition to my dealings with the 
fountain-head, I hunted up a Corps H.Q. at Douai, and was also 
in touch with the French Mission. It soon became clear to me 
that, though these intermittent contacts might be adequate for 
the straightening out of minor tangles, they were hopeless so far 
as any genuine collaboration was concerned.<br><br>
There can be no real co-operation without comradeship, and 
comradeship can be achieved only where there is some degree of 
<b>78</b> daily contact. That holds true of all dealings between men, no 
matter what their nationalities. It is more than ever essential 
when one is dealing with the British, who are affable, confiding, 
and even frank, once they have accepted you as a familiar, though 
deliberately guarded and distant, in spite of their good manners, 
when they have to do business with somebody who is only an 
occasional visitor. If you went to see them officially, they would 
give you perfectly correct answers to any questions you might 
ask, but nothing more. Probably we should have done just the 
same. But was that enough? The goal of our endeavours should 
have been to learn how to handle a war machine which was very 
different to our own, but with which it had got to be synchronized. 
It was essential that we should realize what were its weaknesses— 
if it had any (and what army has not?); that we should 
understand—in order to make others understand later—points of view 
which did not always, unfortunately, coincide with those of our 
own High Command; that we should make (and this was the 
most important point of all) close human contacts, because only 
when such exist is it possible for either side to offer fruitful 
suggestions without wounding the self-esteem of the other, or to 
avoid, in the moment of danger, the fatal temptation of putting 
one’s own interest first. All this could never be achieved by 
occasional visits. We ought to have got into the habit of taking 
tea together every afternoon, as well as stray whiskies and sodas; 
we ought to have immersed ourselves in that club atmosphere 
which is not confined to the mess but serves as a unifying element 
even when its members are back at their desks. What, in a word, 
was needed was that we should have an officer of First Army 
permanently attached to British G.H.Q. This opinion of mine 
was shared by the Chief of Staff of the French Mission, though 
his championship remained, unfortunately, without effect owing 
to the turn taken by events. For that particular Army, less its 
XVIth Corps, which was detached for the defence of Dunkirk, 
received orders just after 15 or 16 May (I think) to withdraw 
<b>79</b> altogether from the Antwerp front. Later it was thrown into 
the breach between the Meuse and the Oise, where it was almost 
completely wiped out.<br><br>
Our efforts at First Army were confined to getting permission 
for an officer from British G.H.Q. to be attached to Intelligence. 
The first to come was a retired regular who had subsequently 
gone into the City. His manners, which were at once brusque 
and hearty, the air he had of enjoying life, and his humour— 
which, no doubt, seemed more original to us than it would have 
done to his compatriots—made him popular. He was an 
enthusiastic soldier, and had the reputation of being very touchy 
on all matters affecting his authority as representative of the 
British C.-in-C. It may well be that the rather intemperate zeal 
of some of my comrades made him suspicious of an interference 
which he was determined not to brook. My own relations with 
him were always of the friendliest, but he certainly wanted to 
keep all the strings in his own hands, and I am afraid that his 
influence on our senior officers was not always without danger. 
He was, above all, extremely shrewd, and, in addition, deeply 
imbued with that social snobbery from which the members of 
the English upper middle class are rarely free. Nor was he 
wholly innocent of those national prejudices which are inherent 
in the old crusted Tory tradition, though he was far too polite 
to display them.<br><br>
Only a very simple soul would have expected him to inform 
us about the weak points in the equipment and methods of our 
British allies. He left us shortly before 10 May to take up an 
appointment in the Ministry of Economic Warfare in London. 
He never, therefore, had an opportunity of rendering those 
services to the common cause which, I am sure, would have been 
forthcoming under the stress of danger. With his successor I 
had very little to do. He was just as delightful, though not so 
good a mixer. I only once had professional dealings with him, at 
Lens, when I found him rather over-anxious to shift responsibility.<br><br>
<b>80</b> But whatever might be the personal idiosyncrasies of these 
delegates from an Allied army, even the best of them, when one 
comes to think of it, could have done no more than supply half 
the diplomatic representation needed. What Government 
wishing to maintain contact with a friendly country, to be informed 
of what is going on, and to establish a solid basis of mutual 
understanding which may serve as the foundation for a lasting 
friendship, will ever rest content with offering hospitality to its 
neighbour’s ambassador, and will, on the ground that he is 
wholly admirable, refuse to send a representative of its own in 
return?<br><br>

With this thought in mind, therefore, I took my courage in 
two hands and asked for an interview with our Chief of Staff, 
who was then in temporary command of the Army. I put all 
the arguments to him as best I could, and made it quite plain 
that I was not after the job of liaison officer at Lord Gort’s H.Q. 
Any such appointment, I said, should be given to somebody far 
better versed in military theory than I was. But I played my 
cards badly. Fearful lest my personal opinion might carry too 
little weight, I supported my case by quoting the more-informed 
opinion of the head of the French Mission. Alas! It so happened 
that the lieutenant-colonel to whom I was putting my case was 
the bosom enemy of that other lieutenant-colonel whose views 
I was mentioning in support of my own. This ill-fated choice 
of a guarantor did not help me. The roads of the Staff College 
are rich in traps for the unwary feet of those who have not been 
brought up in ‘court circles’! I was politely allowed to have my 
say. My interlocutor made it quite plain that he found my 
arguments inconclusive, and that, in his opinion, the presence of a 
British officer at First Army H.Q. was all that was necessary. 
Later on I did what I could to get the question taken up at French 
G.H.Q., but again without result. The end of it all was that I 
grew sick of taking the trouble to travel the Arras road for no 
better purpose than to indulge in a few minutes of casual 
conversa-<b>81</b>tion, and gave up the whole business. My superiors seemed quite 
unperturbed by this failure of mine to carry out instructions, and 
from then on I gave the whole of my time to supervising petrol 
supplies.<br><br>
During active operations, one of our senior staff officers, who 
had already had dealings with the British, acted as our go- 
between. He was intelligent, and his outlook was a good deal 
less limited than that of most of his colleagues. I am convinced, 
not only that he did his best, but that his best was considerably 
better than what anybody else could have done. But he had never 
shared the daily life of our Allies, and did not do so even after 
he had taken up his post, but spent most of his time running 
from H.Q. to H.Q. The chief trouble was that events were 
making any real mutual confidence between the two armies less 
and less easy. Co-operation could have been proof against the 
difficulties of the time only if it had been firmly based earlier. 
A genuine alliance is something that has to be worked at all the 
time. It is not enough to have it set down on paper. It must 
draw the breath of life from a multiplicity of daily contacts which, 
taken together, knit the two parties solidly into a single whole. 
That truth had been too long forgotten at First Army H.Q., and 
we suffered terribly as a result of our negligence.[1]<br><br>
As already explained, I spent some time when I first went to 
First Army, with Intelligence. Later on, my efforts to get a 
reliable and up-to-date list of Belgian fuel dumps brought me 
in contact with both Army Group and G.H.Q. Intelligence. I 
should be a poor historian, indeed, if I had not always taken a 
particular interest in information and evidence. But just because 
I was an historian, the methods which I found in use soon filled 
me with alarm and despondency.<br><br>
<b>82</b> Let me make my meaning quite clear. I have no wish to 
include under a general blanket condemnation a group of men 
which included a great many who, whether regulars or reservists, 
were undoubtedly hard-working and competent officers. In the 
course of my inquiries I was always made welcome at, if not 
greatly helped by, G.H.Q. Intelligence, and at Army Group I 
found a degree of understanding, and a willingness to assist, 
which I valued enormously. At Army things were not so good, 
and when we were in the mood to talk freely, we made no bones 
about admitting it. The officer with the charming manners who 
was in charge of Army Intelligence would have shown to fine 
advantage at the head of a ‘spit and polish’ battalion on parade, 
nor have I any reason to assume that he would not have behaved 
impeccably on the field of battle. But it was quite clear that he 
was not up to the job he had been given. Still, the fact that his 
direction of the work of his office was incompetent cast but the 
lightest of shadows on our spirits. I had a number of admirable 
colleagues—I might almost call them friends—on the Intelligence 
Staff, especially in the interpreters’ section, which was in charge 
of a seasoned old ruffian—in private life he was a little 
businessman—who rode his subordinates with a light rein. They slaved 
away, giving of their best, and showed a fine spirit of self- 
sacrifice not wholly unmixed with shrewdness, in a sphere which 
was, inevitably, somewhat limited. But it is no good hiding the 
fact that we were kept very badly supplied with information. 
I was in a position to see a good deal of the Intelligence work 
that went on in regard to Belgium. I have already explained that, 
from the very beginning, G.H.Q. had doled out to us very vague 
and often erroneous particulars about the position, the capacity, 
and die contents of the various dumps. Worse still, no steps 
were taken to see that the mistakes were corrected. We had no 
idea how the fuel-supply service in the Belgian Army was 
organized, though, if it came to common action against an 
aggressor, we should have to work in close collaboration with it. 
<b>83</b> I did my best to find out. General Blanchard was good enough 
to sign a personal letter asking for the required details. It 
remained unanswered. I have reason to suppose that this state 
of ignorance was not confined to my branch of the service.<br><br>
It was due to a number of reasons. In the first place, too 
many people were concerned in the business of gathering 
information, and there was an ugly atmosphere of competition 
among them. About this I shall have more to say later. The 
various military attachés were responsible, not to G.H.Q. but to 
the War Office, which was always very sensitive where its 
prerogatives were involved. Under the pretext of a wholly 
fallacious respect for the needs of neutrality, the War Office and 
G.H.Q. were in complete agreement on one point—that 
subordinate formations must, under no conditions, initiate any sort 
of survey on the other side of the Belgian frontier. As a matter 
of fact, neither Army nor Group hesitated to do so on their own, 
and more than one piece of useful information reached us in this 
more or less clandestine way. Would it not have been far better 
to have organized these various efforts into a whole?<br><br>
Improved organization and a keener sense of fact would have 
been a great advantage. An Intelligence Service ought to act as 
a kind of agency operating in the interests of the various 
formations which are—in effect—its customers. It should be in a 
position to answer questions addressed to it by gunners, air-arm, 
tanks, and the departments in charge of rail and road movement, 
as well as by ‘G’ branch which forms the head of the staff pyramid. 
Each of these different bodies has demands to make relative to 
its own peculiar requirements, and these are apt to be neglected 
by non-specialists. It should be the business of Intelligence to 
anticipate their needs, and to provide the required facts even 
before they are demanded. It should circulate to each all relevant 
information as soon as it is available. But instead of this being 
done, Intelligence scarcely ever moved outside the narrow limits 
prescribed for it by a tradition that knew nothing of the needs 
<b>84</b> of mechanical warfare. Its chief preoccupation was the more or 
less hypothetical establishment of the ‘enemy order of battle’, 
or, in other words, of the way in which his units were disposed.<br><br>
This was thought to provide a clear idea of his intentions, 
whereas, more often than not, owing to the rapidity with which 
movements are carried out nowadays, the evidence thus gathered was 
susceptible of three or four mutually contradictory 
interpretations. To this, its main task, were added certain routine inquiries 
about morale and political conditions, and these were normally 
carried out by men who were obviously ignorant of the ABC of 
sociological analysis. I remember a leaflet purporting to provide 
inside information about influences at work in Belgium, which 
thought it had said all that was necessary when it had remarked, 
in the best Almanack de Gotha style, that the form of the 
kingdom was that of a ‘Constitutional Monarchy’! How much that 
amounted to we were to learn from bitter experience!<br><br>

As to the dissemination of information, it was a standing joke 
at most headquarters that, as soon as Intelligence found out 
anything, it proceeded to put it down on paper, mark the document 
in red ink ‘Top Secret’, and then shut it away from all those 
likely to be interested in its contents, in a safe with a triple lock. 
I had clear proof one day that this was not just a good story. I 
had got Intelligence to promise that it would circulate to the 
various Corps H.Q. the annotated list of Belgian fuel dumps 
which we had at long last managed to compile. A little later we 
had occasion to issue to senior formations a series of general 
instructions on the subject of indenting for fuel in the event of an 
advance into Belgium. It dealt first with the subject of 
requisitioning, passed on to describe the arrangements which would 
be made by First Army for setting up its own depots, and referred 
recipients for details about the whereabouts of local supplies to 
the table already circulated. In every case it was passed to ‘Q’ 
On the very day of its publication I had a rather acid telephone 
call from my opposite number at Corps. ‘You mention a Table. 
<b>85</b> No Table has come our way.’ I at once instituted inquiries. The 
document had been duly dispatched. But, according to army 
rules and regulations, whenever instructions are issued by one 
particular section of the staff, they go, with the certainty of 
gravity, to the same section of the subordinate formation to 
which they are addressed, which, in this case, happened to be 
Intelligence. There our precious table had been immediately 
shut away in the famous secret safe, and no one had taken the 
trouble to pass on the information which it contained to the one 
officer capable of using it! My indignation was greeted by my 
colleagues with cynical shrugs: ‘The same old story!’ The 
question of putting the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders 
of those responsible, or of taking steps to see that such mistakes 
should not occur in future, was never even considered. Army 
routine, apparently, was too deeply rooted to be disturbed. <br><br>

Intelligence, with us, was far from being a model of 
organization, as we very well knew. Nevertheless, even the most hardened 
staff officer could not refrain from a faint surprise at some of the 
‘appreciations’ issued during the period of waiting which preceded 
the German offensive. One particular railway map became 
famous. A mistake in the tracing had turned Aix-la-Chapelle 
into a Belgian city, and the main line from Hamburg to Berlin 
was shown as a ‘branch’ capable of carrying only light traffic! 
That, however, was not a very serious matter because the blunder 
was too obvious to deceive anybody. The ‘Intelligence 
Summary’, however, which appeared at brief intervals, contained 
fundamental errors which, in the event, were to have serious 
consequences. Consider, for a moment, what happens when anyone 
engaged on exact research sets about drawing up the balance- 
sheet of his discoveries—an archaeologist, for instance, 
publishing successive summaries of his finds, a doctor working over a 
case-entry with his pupils, or the kind of information confided 
by Pasteur to his famous ‘working note-book’. What do we 
expect to find in such scientific documents? We rely on them to 
<b>86</b> tell us, at each stage of the investigation under review, that some 
piece of evidence, till now lacking confirmation, has been proved 
correct; that some interpretation of the facts, formerly undisputed, 
must, in the light of subsequent discoveries, be henceforward 
discredited. Similarly, when it is not the past that we are 
studying, but some set of phenomena relating to a principle still active, 
we expect to be told whenever a new piece of evidence may 
emerge, in the light of which it is quite possible that the whole 
elaborate structure of our conclusions will have to be changed. 
In other words, knowledge being essentially a progressive 
movement of the intelligence, and knowledge of events, which by 
their very nature can never be static, being possible only when 
the graph of that movement can be constantly consulted, any 
single statement of results must always be valueless unless it can 
be compared with similar statements made at an earlier stage of 
the inquiry. Now these ‘summaries’ were circulated in series, 
without any attempt being made to stress the relationship between 
them. By studying them closely, one often came to realize that 
they were mutually contradictory, or that, having first underlined 
one particular group of facts as offering results rich in possibilities, 
a later issue would gaily relegate these same facts to oblivion 
without a word of warning or explanation. Were we to assume, 
then, that the later ‘appreciation’ entirely superseded the earlier? 
—that all reference to former information had been deliberately 
avoided?—that the whole situation had radically changed? It 
would have needed a very clever man to answer such questions. 
To be perfectly frank, I am not a little afraid of falling into the 
sin of calumny, because, more than once, I found myself 
wondering how much of this muddled thinking was due to lack of skill, 
how much to conscious guile. Every officer in charge of an 
Intelligence section lived in a state of constant terror that when 
the blow fell events might blow sky-high all the conclusions 
which he had told the general in command were ‘absolutely 
certain’. To put before him a wide choice of mutually 
contra-<b>87</b>dictory inferences ensured that no matter what might happen, 
one could say with an air of triumph—’If only you had listened 
to my advice!’[1]<br><br>
What, precisely, was the value of the services rendered by 
Intelligence to the operational staff in the matter of day-to-day 
reports, once active fighting had begun? On that point I should 
be hard put to it to pronounce judgement, because no particulars 
of what was said or done ever reached me. But one thing is certain. 
The famous ‘summaries’ were, from then on, condemned to a 
silence as complete as it was prudent, with the result that those 
officers whose job resembled mine never got any information at all 
about the enemy, save what they were lucky enough to pick up 
in general conversation, or as the result of some chance meeting— 
in other words, almost exactly nil, or, at least, nil in comparison 
with what their, possibly idle, curiosity demanded in the way of 
mental sustenance, or with what they should most certainly have 
known if they were to carry out their duties efficiently. When, 
as occasionally happened, one did stumble on some fact of 
importance, one was left with no alternative (I have already 
quoted a specific instance), in the absence of any proper 
clearinghouse, but to go straight to the army commander. Such odds 
and ends of Intelligence should, of course, be thoroughly 
arranged and digested before being presented to a commanding 
officer who has already got more on his plate than he can 
conveniently absorb.<br><br>
It is not enough that such centres or ‘agencies’—to repeat my 
<b>88</b> former analogy—should be grouped into a single Intelligence 
Branch charged with both issuing and receiving information. 
Each section of the staff should contain at least one specialist 
officer whose whole duty it should be to sift and circulate all 
available ‘news’. How could we possibly keep the forward units 
supplied with ammunition, food, engineers’ stores, and fuel, or 
how could we establish munition dumps, rail-heads, sappers’ 
dumps, or mobile supply columns, if half the time we did not 
know where the formations concerned were located, or how the 
enemy was moving?[1].<br><br><br><br>
The faulty methods of work used by Intelligence, and by 
many other branches of the staff in all the armies, did not, for 
the most part, remain unnoticed by our senior generals, and I am 
pretty sure that among the latter and those working in close 
touch with them there were plenty of keen-sighted men who, in 
the intimacy of their own hearts, condemned this state of affairs. 
How came it, then, that no disciplinary action was ever taken, 
and that none of those responsible were removed from their 
posts? ‘Punishment in the French Army is a thing of the past’— 
my young friends of the fighting formations said on more than 
one occasion. The generalization is, no doubt, crude, but there 
is more than a grain of truth in it. The whole question of 
‘authority’ was passing through a period of crisis, and giving 
rise to a situation which must be analysed in greater detail.<br><br>

<b>89</b> At one time I saw a great deal of certain regimental officers. 
I do not doubt that now, as formerly, there are a great many fine 
fellows among them who are capable of running their units with 
justice and a tactful firmness as far removed, on the one hand, 
from easy-going slackness—the very idea of which is abhorrent 
to me—as from the absurd bullying methods of the legendary 
‘Barrack-Square fire-eater’ on the other. There is no finer job 
than that of the company, battalion, or regimental commander 
when it is carried out with the high-mindedness which belongs 
of right to the French tradition. I have often noticed that it 
develops in men who have inherited the right attitude, those 
virtues of humanity for which I have the highest admiration. I 
am glad to say that I found them in that charming staff officer 
who was for some time second-in-command of our section before 
he moved on to more elevated spheres. ‘Now <i>he’s</i> gone’, was the 
sad refrain of the orderly-room clerks, ‘there’ll be nobody to 
bother about <i>us</i>! Only the stupid are afraid that sympathy may 
deteriorate into familiarity.<br><br>
But from what I have heard—and I have no reason to 
disbelieve the stories—the control of large bodies of men did not 
always or everywhere show a similar degree of humane 
imagination. There are two phrases which I should like to see deleted 
from the soldier’s vocabulary—’breaking in’ and ‘toeing the 
line’. They may have been all right for the soldiers of the Royal 
Sergeant Major,[1] but they have no place in a truly national army. 
Not that I wish to deny that even in a national army, perhaps 
<i>especially</i> in a national army, discipline is necessary, or that it has 
to be learned. But it should be an extension of civic virtue, and, 
as Pierre Hamp has so well said when speaking of true courage— 
‘an expression of the professional conscience’. I once heard an 
officer become eloquent over his surprise at the efficiency of the 
girl telephonists employed at the main Army switchboard. ‘They 
do it as well as they would if they were <i>soldiers</i>—he said in a 
<b>90</b> tone of voice which I could never hope to describe, so shaken 
was it with outraged amazement. How could a man so dominated 
by caste prejudice hope to be a successful commander of troops 
raised from the mass of the people for the defence of their country, 
men who, in civil life, had grown accustomed to the freedom of 
the family circle? <br><br>
In practice, this business of ‘toeing the line’ is almost always 
confused with a forced respect for certain external marks of 
authority. Such respect, though not without value when it is 
the expression of a deep and sincere sense of hierarchy, cannot 
with profit be insisted upon except when a spirit of confidence 
has been created which is sufficiently strong to ensure that any 
act of public deference springs spontaneously from a genuine 
wish to show respect. I am prepared even to admit that men 
must be ‘broken in’, but only if that process takes into account 
their quality of human beings—as every true leader has always 
been ready to recognize. I should most certainly not apply the 
words ‘true leader’ to the colonel—and I believe this story to be 
true—who broke one of his N.C.O.s because, on one very cold 
day, he caught him with his hands in the pockets of his 
greatcoat, and who insisted on having reports rendered to him at 
intervals during each day on the turn-out of his men, though he 
thought nothing of leaving them to freeze in the depths of winter 
in badly organized huts. I myself witnessed the effects produced 
by one such attempt at ‘breaking in’. It was in Normandy, when 
we were being reorganized after the Flanders campaign. How 
willing, how profoundly ‘decent’, the men were at that time! 
Even the most hardened old sweat felt touched by the daily 
spectacle of their behaviour. They came to us straight from the 
trains, after an exhausting journey, often half-starved, sometimes 
with no clothes but the odd assortment of garments which the 
English had provided when they fished them out of the sea after 
the ship on which they were travelling had gone to the bottom. 
They had lost their units, their officers, their pals. Not 
in-<b>91</b>frequently they had walked miles before reaching a camp where 
they could find something of that atmosphere of mutual help and 
companionship which is so necessary a part of the soldier’s life. 
Not one word of complaint did I hear. The least little thing we 
managed to do for them was accepted with a hearty ‘Thank you, 
sir’, which we found more than sufficient reward for any efforts 
we might have made. They were so pleased not only at being 
once more, if only temporarily, sheltered from the blast, but at 
discovering, too, that some officer, about whom they had been 
worrying, was safe and sound. Some of the handshakes that I 
got on that occasion warmed my heart. Indeed, the memory of 
those days would make it impossible for me ever to despair of 
the French people—assuming that I were otherwise tempted 
to do so.<br><br>
I am sure that the general sent to command us meant well. 
There was no doubting the sincerity of his faith in the military 
virtues, and he was as hard on himself as he was on others. But 
he was deficient in psychological insight. He decided that the 
prevailing atmosphere was not that of a well-conducted barracks, 
and set about putting things to rights. The number of officers’ 
inspections rapidly increased, and we began to be snowed up 
under an accumulation of reports reaching us from all sides on 
such subjects as defective pullovers. Fresh from what the 
newspapers were already rather pompously, but not altogether 
erroneously, calling the ‘Hell of Flanders’, some of us had planned 
to bring our wives to the villages in which we were billeted. 
Privates as well as officers were to have this privilege, and there 
was to be equality of treatment for all. The general came down 
on the idea like a ton of bricks. It was permissible, in his opinion, 
for a fighting soldier to go to the local brothel if he wanted to, 
but he maintained that the legitimate intimacies of married love 
would merely serve to weaken morale. He was a just man 
according to his lights, and he started the ball rolling by awarding 
fifteen days’ close arrest to the elderly general of reserve who, 
<b>92</b> up till then, had been in charge of us, because he had come on 
him one evening walking arm-in-arm with his equally elderly 
wife. We officers treated the whole thing as a huge joke. Not 
so the rank and file. In the course of a few days the whole moral 
tone of the camp had completely changed. A significant symptom 
of the deterioration was to be found in the fact that whereas the 
men had previously saluted with whole-hearted enthusiasm, 
they now did so grudgingly and obviously only because they 
had to. The so-called ‘breaking in’ had admirably succeeded, 
and in the shortest possible time, in completely ruining the fine, 
healthy attitude of soldiers who had recently emerged from the 
furnace of war, and would soon, or so we believed, be going 
back into it.<br><br>
Several people I have met who lived, from 1914 to 1918, under 
German occupation, and have again been subjected to the same 
fate in recent months, have told me, quite independently of one 
another, something with which I have been greatly struck—that 
compared with the old Imperial army, the troops of the Nazi 
régime have the appearance of being far more ‘democratic’. The 
gulf between officers and men seems now to be less unbridgeable 
(though, as I can testify from personal experience, the German 
officer of to-day has the same bad habit as his predecessor of 
never returning salutes in a proper manner). From highest to 
lowest there is a more clearly marked participation by all ranks 
in a general atmosphere of goodwill. That spiritual communion 
which is the outcome of the special brand of mysticism rife in 
modern Germany is extremely powerful, and we should not let 
the crudity of its origins blind us to that truth. It would be 
disastrous should our own national spirit be compromised by the 
dominance of old traditions modelled on those of the Prussian 
school, which, fundamentally, are so antipathetic to it, especially 
when in Prussia itself they are now held to be out of date.<br><br>
For good or ill the old habits of punishment have certainly 
not been forgotten in the French Army. It might be better if 
<b>93</b> they had been. It is only too obvious that our High Command 
did not, as it could and should have done, take advantage of the 
long period of waiting imposed upon it by the enemy to carry 
out much necessary purging of the personnel of the regular army. 
A few officers in the First Army were, to be sure, ‘bowler- 
hatted’ when active operations began, to the accompaniment of 
a considerable amount of publicity. But why had this disciplinary 
action been left to wait until the proper time for it had gone by? 
Glaring cases of incompetence had been notorious long before 
that date.<br><br>
Here is another example of what I mean, should one be needed. 
Our D.A.Q.M.G. was an old officer whose utter unfitness for 
the job was not disguised by his rather childlike friendliness with 
all and sundry. ‘For the last thirty years I’ve never really 
understood what it is I’m supposed to do’, he loved to say. This frank 
admission was a standing joke with us, and I should be much 
surprised to discover that it had not percolated to the highest 
quarters. The duties of this deserving pupil of Captain Bravida 
did not, while we were at Bohain, amount to much. But it was 
pretty obvious that once active hostilities began, they would 
become a great deal more onerous. They included, officially, 
the organization of staff cars, which, both before and, 
unfortunately, after 10 May, left much to be desired. The 
retirement of an officer of his rank would not have involved anything 
like the same complications as the dismissal of the Commander- 
in-Chief, or even of an army commander. But this clown of a 
colonel was allowed to stay on, not only for the whole of the 
winter, but through all the subsequent campaign—though, 
incidentally, during the latter period we saw little or nothing of 
him—until the day when, just as he was about to embark at 
Dunkirk, he mysteriously disappeared. What happened to him? 
His end became a matter of legend. It is wiser to admit that 
nothing is known, and to assume—as, after all, is most likely— 
either that he just died for his country or was accidentally taken 
<b>94</b> prisoner. It was certainly not his fault that he had been maintained 
in a post that had put too great a strain on his modest 
capabilities. Nor was he the only one in like case. Ruthlessness of the 
kind shown by Joffre in 1914 was conspicuous by its absence. 
We could have done with a few of his ‘Young Turks’. Some of 
them were still alive. But by 1940 they were elderly men, 
weighed down with honours and spoiled by a lifetime of office- 
work and easy success. For the ‘flabbiness’ which was so evident 
in the High Command had its origin chiefly in habits of living 
contracted during the years of peace. The ‘paper’ mania, too, 
had a good deal to do with it. What would have happened if 
the senior Intelligence Officer who failed to pass on information 
of the first importance to the only man capable of using it had 
been at the head of one of the big departments of a private 
business concern? His boss would, I imagine, have sent for him, 
told him a few home truths behind locked doors, and sent him 
back to his office with a pretty threatening—’see it doesn’t 
happen again’. And it probably would not have happened again. 
Very different were conditions in the Army, as I saw them. Had 
I wished to get the guilty party reprimanded by my immediate 
superior, by the Chief of Staff, or, in the last resort, by the army 
commander, I should have had to submit a complaint in writing. 
Worse still, this memorandum, in accordance with sacrosanct 
military tradition, would have had to be addressed to the corps 
commander, since communications between formations could be 
conducted only at the highest level. The whole business would 
thus have become a major ‘incident’. The general tone of the 
advice given to me was that I had much better not get mixed up 
in a lot of fuss and bother. My report would have been 
successively watered down at each stage of its travels, and nothing 
at all would have happened about it even if, at long last, it had 
reached the august desk. Add to this the terror of ‘making a 
nuisance of oneself, the mania for handling all such matters with 
kid gloves, which becomes second nature with men who are 
<b>95</b> itching for promotion: the fear of annoying those who are 
powerful to-day or who may become powerful to-morrow. On 
one occasion, as a result of a suggestion of mine, it was decided 
to reduce the issue of petrol to one of the corps, and to increase 
that of another by the amount thus saved. This involved the 
sending out of two complementary sets of instructions. The 
Deputy Chief of Staff, who at that time was acting for his 
superior, got General Blanchard to sign the order limiting 
consumption, though he sent out over his own signature the letter 
which gave the second corps the good news that they might draw 
more liberally on the supplies available. In this way he managed 
to insinuate that the piece of bad news had nothing to do with 
him, but that he was wholly responsible for the good one. That 
is the way in which an officer seeks to assure his future. By 
making oneself party to a reprimand, one runs the risk of 
compromising one’s chances. If one is not too sure of oneself, one 
certainly fears, rightly or wrongly, that they may be 
compromised. Routine is, by nature, elastic. Those bred up in army 
ways had, in the course of years spent in the bureaucratic machine, 
grown used to a certain amount of incompetence which rarely, 
if ever, ended tragically. Times changed, but not habits. To 
put the matter in a nutshell, one can say that staff experience 
under peace conditions did not provide a good training for 
character. The truth of that generalization turned out, in more 
ways than one, to be only too obvious.[1]<br><br>
<b>96</b> There is an old army saying about the mutual feelings of any 
two officers who happen to be travelling together up the ladder 
of promotion. ‘If they are Lieutenants, they are friends: if 
Captains, comrades: if Majors, colleagues: if Colonels, rivals: 
if Generals, enemies.’ I leave the reader to decide whether I am 
in a position to speak with knowledge of the professional jealousy 
which formed the subject of so much covert gossip among my 
companions. Fanned to flame by the crowd of hangers-on 
inevitably surrounding each boss with a complexity of flattery 
and intrigue, it fed on the fuel that was only too prevalent in a 
system of multiple seniority. French Army authorities have 
never realized that the greater the number of layers that an order 
or a ‘mem’ has to penetrate in the course of its journey from 
point of origin to point of reception, the greater is the risk that 
it will never arrive in time. Worse still, where the number of 
senior officers is too large, responsibility becomes so diluted that 
it is never felt as an urgent personal preoccupation by any one 
of them. This defect of the military bureaucracy flourishes at 
every level. I have already made it clear that if we, who were 
concerned with the provision and distribution of fuel, had 
observed regulations to the letter, we should have found a 
staircase of three flights separating the representative of the army 
commander from the officers who actually had to carry out all 
instructions that were issued. Between the colonel of an infantry 
regiment and division stood the masking wall of the divisional 
staff, or, as we used to put it when I was a foot-slogger, a ‘proper 
brake’. I should be surprised to learn that this nickname was 
any less applicable now than it was then. Higher still was a whole 
series of other formations—Army, Army-Group (in principle, 
a mere device to ensure strategic co-operation, though it 
frequently tried to free itself from this limitation), the 
Commander of the North-East Theatre of Operations—who was 
responsible for the conduct of hostilities on the whole of the 
French front, Alps excepted—and, finally, the Commander-in-<b>97</b>Chief 
of the land forces. At a time when a division of functions 
had been arranged between these last two—or, in ordinary 
human terms, between General Georges and General Gamelin— 
I was once present at a lecture staged by G.H.Q. with the object 
of explaining the new organization. The speaker made himself 
as clear as he knew how. I was not, however, the only one there 
who entirely failed to get any clear-cut idea of what he was 
trying to bring home to us. There was confusion and 
overlapping at every turn: and it was inevitable that there should be. 
Various echoes that reached me later were proof that our fears 
had not been ill founded. And even so, we were reckoning 
without that third embryo of a Headquarters Staff, lying concealed 
in the innermost recesses of the temple—the Commander-in- 
Chief’s Military Cabinet.<br><br> 
One of the most remarkable officers it was ever my good 
fortune to encounter—the lieutenant-colonel whose concern for 
our orderly-room clerks I have already mentioned—once said 
to me: ‘There should never be any branches in a Headquarters 
Staff.’ He meant by this that any such subdivision, though 
perhaps inevitable, was always fraught with danger. For each 
part or branch is almost bound to slip into the fallacy of 
substituting itself for the whole, and the small enclosed world of 
the staff to regard itself as synonymous with the nation. ‘G’— 
which is the home of the strategists, and was named by our more 
bitter wits ‘The Brains Trust’—is normally regarded as the Holy 
of Holies. Proud of their function, which, it cannot be denied, is 
extremely important and delicate, the officers belonging to it are 
not always careful to co-operate as closely as they should with 
those of their colleagues who partake less regularly of the pure 
milk of the military word. They even seem, at times, to treat 
with a certain degree of contempt those activities without which 
the lines and arrows traced on the operational maps would remain 
but empty symbols. The same is true, for other reasons, of 
Intelligence, whose members live in a world haunted by the 
spirit of secrecy. Not that the formal code of good manners is 
not, save by a few cantankerous characters, scrupulously 
observed. The fact remains, however, that a system of watertight 
compartments is universal in the higher reaches of the Army. 
Nowhere have I found them less penetrable than at the very 
top—G.H.Q. I once spent the whole of a January afternoon 
trying, unsuccessfully, to get Intelligence and ‘Q’ to agree on 
some sort of common action. The particular point at issue had 
to do, I need hardly say, with fuel supply—which meant that it 
was not wholly unimportant. Since it involved a number of 
persons whom I have no right to compromise, I must, in 
speaking of it, proceed rather circumspectly. 
There was, in a small neutral country situated at about an 
equal distance from the French and German frontiers, a certain 
dump containing motor fuel and lubricants. The man on whom 
I usually relied for information had not merely given me details 
of the capacity (which was considerable) of the tanks, but had 
sent me the following message: ‘I can, if you so wish, see to it 
that they are always kept filled to the maximum. This would 
make your supply problem easier in the event of your finding 
yourselves constrained, some day, to move your troops into the 
territory on which they are situated. Alternatively, I can 
maintain the bare minimum necessary for the requirements of 
peaceful commerce, thereby avoiding the danger of having to abandon 
valuable resources to the Germans. It is for the French General 
Staff to decide. As soon as I know what they want done, I will 
take the necessary steps.’ The whole problem resolved itself 
<b>98</b> into knowing whether, in the event of a German breach of 
neutrality, the High Command meant us or the enemy to reach 
this particular locality first. I was not competent to reach a 
decision on my own responsibility, for the Army holding this 
sector of the frontier was not the one to which I belonged, nor 
did it even form part of our ‘Group’. There was nothing for it, 
therefore, but to ask G.H.Q. for orders. I went first to 
Intelligence, to which I had certain other pieces of information to 
impart. When I touched on the burning question, the gentlemen 
of that particular branch said, not without some show of 
plausibility—’Our job is to collect information, not to make decisions: 
go to “Q”.’ They did not, however, offer to go with me. 
Doubtless they had their reasons for not doing so. It would, I suppose, 
in any case have been more natural for me to go direct to the 
senior officer in charge of operations, or to one of his 
representatives. But it is scarcely fitting for one of the uninitiated to knock 
at the door of the sanctuary. So I was very soon on my way down 
the long street of la Ferté-sous-Jouarre, sown thick with military 
police, to the home of ‘Q’, with the intricacies of which branch 
I was, I need hardly say, already familiar. I was passed on from 
office to office. In each I heard the same formula: ‘We don’t 
know what the enemy may mean to do. Our job is to keep you 
supplied with <i>French</i> stuff. Besides, are you sure that this fellow 
is trustworthy? He may be trying to lead us into a trap.’<br><br>
‘Intelligence is prepared to guarantee the soundness of the 
information.’<br><br>
‘Oh, Intelligence! What’s Intelligence got to do with fuel 
supplies? If they’ve started meddling in your affairs, they’d 
better go on.’ <br><br>
‘That’s all right by me. But if that’s the line you’ve decided 
to take, I wish you’d give them a ring and tell them so.’ 
This they did, and I at least had the satisfaction of hearing 
what appeared to be a rather acid conversation. Each party to 
it seemed to be purely concerned with passing the buck. At the 
<b>99</b> end of a few minutes ‘my’ end terminated the exchange by 
observing drily—’that’s not our business’. It was just like two 
householders quarrelling over a party-wall. The only things they 
neither of them seemed to be concerned about were the needs of 
the French Army as a whole. Being mulish by nature, I took 
the matter up again with ‘Q’. My pilgrimage from department 
to department brought me finally into the presence of two 
lieutenant-colonels. I explained my mission with considerable 
warmth—with more warmth, probably, than was becoming in 
one of my relatively humble rank, but pulled myself up just in 
time not to overstep the bounds of hierarchic decency, and, 
since a scandal would have spelt irremediable disaster, said no 
more. But I felt thoroughly discouraged. All I had got for my 
pains was a vague promise that the point should be put to the 
Director of Supplies, who, no doubt, would consult his opposite 
number at ‘G’ . . . They had made up their minds, it was clear, 
that the only way of getting rid of a tiresome and probably 
slightly unbalanced visitor was to seem to meet him half-way. 
As things turned out, I never heard another word about the 
affair.<br><br>
All the same, I felt uncomfortable about not sending some 
sort of answer to the ‘sympathizer’ across the frontier who, in 
so disinterested a fashion, and at considerable risk to himself, 
had offered to help us. It was not only that the point he had 
raised was of considerable importance. Unbroken silence on 
our part would have betrayed to this foreigner the 
Shilly-shallying state of mind of the French High Command. It was 
bad enough to know it ourselves. With the approval of the 
French friend (himself not a soldier) who had acted as 
intermediary, I sent the following message: ‘Don’t fill your tanks.’ 
In doing this, I committed a terrible breach of discipline. In the 
event, however, I did not feel any high degree of guilt. The 
storm burst, and, as was only to be expected, the Germans beat 
us to it.<br><br>
<b>100</b> It was these inquiries of mine in the matter of the dump that 
put me wise to the struggle going on inside our own ranks, a 
struggle, as it were, on the side-lines of the far greater one which 
we were waging, or preparing to wage, against the Germans. 
In this secondary campaign, G.H.Q. was at grips with the War 
Office, la Ferté-sous-Jouarre with Paris. This particular form 
of tension was traditional and went back, probably, to the old 
days of Chantilly, when Joffre and Galliéni were the protagonists.<br><br>
Our first attempts to find out something about Belgian fuel 
supplies had produced very incomplete results. The man from 
whom we had got our information was only too anxious to tell 
us more, but how could we let him know what it was that we 
wanted to find out? To ask him to go to Paris was out of the 
question, and he was not anxious to have dealings with the 
Military Attaché, whose visits might have compromised him, or 
with secret agents, who are more used to dealing with mercenary 
informers than honest merchants, and had not, in any case, the 
special knowledge which they would have needed in order to 
discuss matters of fuel supply. The simplest solution of the 
difficulty, it seemed to me, would be for our French intermediary 
to go to Brussels under cover of a business trip. That, too, was 
the opinion of Army Group Intelligence, who were taking great 
interest in the matter. All that remained was to get the necessary 
visas for our willing helper. The mission would involve him in 
considerable self-sacrifice and loss of time. We did not want to 
add to his difficulties by making him kick his heels in police- 
stations and embassy waiting-rooms. The thing seemed easy 
enough. Not only had I the best of reasons for being able to 
answer for the reliability of a man whom I knew intimately, but 
he was well known and highly esteemed in Paris commercial 
circles, and was already in close touch with the military authorities. 
Finally, Army Group and, at a still higher level, G.H.Q. were 
prepared to back his credentials. Nevertheless, the necessary 
formalities would have to be completed through the Intelligence
<b>102</b> department of the War Office. In spite of the categorical 
recommendations of Army Group (which was speaking in the name of 
G.H.Q. as well as in its own), and perhaps because of them, the 
War Office flatly refused to listen. ‘We don’t know this fellow’, 
they said, ‘and we have no idea what it is he proposes to do’ 
(useless to point out that they had been fully informed on this 
point). ‘We can take no responsibility. He must straighten 
things out for himself.’ This he did, at the cost of many tedious 
delays, though, fortunately, owing to his personal contacts, they 
were not as complicated as they might otherwise have been. But 
the incident as a whole taught me that we had to deal, not with 
the French Army, but with a series of jealously guarded preserves 
within it.<br><br>
I was to be brought up, still more blatantly, and in far more 
tragic circumstances, against this same fact when the necessity 
arose, in Normandy, of reconstituting a show of armed might 
out of the flotsam and jetsam saved from Flanders. Not only 
were we passed on from general to general, some of whom 
changed in the course of a single day, and all of whom, as soon 
as they entered on their functions, set about undoing what their 
predecessors had begun; the bitter quarrel between G.H.Q. and 
the War Office went on all the time over our heads and at our 
expense, or, rather, at the expense of the nation. In theory, at 
least, in those early days we took our orders from the second of 
these bodies, because Normandy was regarded in the light of a 
remote back-area (though, in fact, at that time the front was on 
the Somme), far removed from the Army zones. I need not 
stress the truth that this duel was not exactly helpful to us in our 
task of reorganization and re-equipping. The enemy was literally 
at the gates of the city—if, indeed, he was not already within 
them—but that made not the slightest difference to our 
internecine strife. The fact that the struggle was one between, not 
political parties, but parties belonging to the same army, made 
the whole business much less easy to forgive.<br><br>
<b>103</b> For the man who chooses the career of arms, personal courage 
is by far the most necessary of all professional virtues. So 
indispensable is it to the morale of the troops, that no one dreams 
of questioning its presence. I am quite certain that the great 
majority of regular officers are true to this splendid tradition. If, 
here and there, exceptions to the rule have been found—I came 
across one or two in the course of the last war, and have a 
suspicion that I met a few in this one—they do not in any way 
besmirch the honour of the Army as a whole. They merely 
prove that the habit does not always make the monk, and also 
that in all countries and at all times there are men so lacking in 
imagination that they will choose an occupation without 
realizing what it involves. They will, for instance, elect to become 
soldiers without considering that, sooner or later, they may have 
to change the peaceful life of a garrison town for war. Weaklings 
of this kind are really nothing but self-deceived unfortunates. 
But, leaving these extreme cases aside, it is important to grasp 
the fact that the contempt of danger takes many different forms 
and may be present in many different degrees. It is impossible 
to go deeply into the problem without finding oneself brought 
up against certain shameful secrets tucked away in the obscure 
recesses of one’s own memory. Anybody who has ever been 
under fire will know what I mean. Even the most hardened 
warrior is at times hard put to it to control his nerves, though 
there are occasions when the same man will show himself, 
without apparent effort, wholly indifferent to personal risk. His 
bravery has the appearance of being an immediate and automatic 
reflex—the result of habit, or, quite simply, of a well-organized 
nervous system. But courage is not confined to any one 
profession or to any one caste. Experience gained in two wars—and, 
particularly, in that of 1914-18—leads me to the conclusion that 
it is the common property of all healthy human beings—at least, 
in France, whose people have, for the most part, a plentiful 
supply of sound sense and well-knit bodies. It is a popular fallacy 
<b>104</b> among officers that the man of hot temper, the adventurer or the 
hooligan, makes the best soldier. That is far from being the 
truth. I have always noticed that the brutal temperament is apt 
to break under the strain of prolonged danger. Courage, after 
all, is the soldier’s job, and the ordinary, decent man is in the 
habit of doing his daily work conscientiously and properly, 
whether it be at the bench, in the fields, behind the counter, or, 
if I may be allowed to say so, at the desk or in the laboratory. 
He will carry on, without fuss, with what he has got to do, even 
when bombs are falling and bullets are flying, particularly where 
a sense of solidarity with others is added to his natural instinct 
for getting the task finished. This sense may find expression in 
many different ways. It may take the form of a more or less 
irrational resolve not to leave a pal in the lurch, or the perfectly 
conscious determination to sacrifice personal considerations to 
the interests of the nation. But the cruder forms of courage lead, 
by almost imperceptible degrees, to the higher. I have never 
come across better fighters than the miners of the Nord and the 
Pas de Calais whom I saw at close quarters in the first war. I 
found only one exception to this rule, and for a long time it 
puzzled me, until I discovered, quite by chance, that the man in 
question was a ‘scab’, by which I mean a non-unionist employed 
as a strike-breaker. It is not a question of party politics. Quite 
simply, it comes to this: that where, in times of peace, class- 
loyalty is absent, the ability to put selfish interests last fails 
inevitably on the field of battle. Most of the rank and file, and 
many of the officers, who made up the infantry who fought at 
Verdun and on the Somme, were reservists, and so, too, more 
recently, were my colleagues of the supply columns, the men 
who drove the mobile fuel containers, and so often, without a 
moment’s thought for the danger they were running, would set 
fire to loads of petrol drums in an endeavour to keep them out 
of the enemy’s hands: the men who supplied the tanks at a time 
when the line was so fluid that quite often they could not pack 
<b>105</b> up, but had to dash back with the containers bumping along 
behind the tractors, and all their feed-pipes hanging out. These 
men were officially classed as ‘second line’ troops, and were, for 
the most part, unarmed. I have a vivid memory of one 
greathearted chap, a chauffeur in civil life, who was mortally wounded 
in one of these refuelling operations, but obstinately refused to 
be picked up. ‘I’ve had it,’ he said; ‘Get to hell out of this! I 
don’t want any of my pals to be done in just because of me!’ 
In the course of those now far distant four years of 1914-18— 
and for me they will always be the ‘real’ war—I saw many such 
cases of courage. About them I shall say no more. If I let 
myself go, I could talk on for ever.<br><br>
A great deal has been said in recent months about cases of 
cowardice among the troops, and especially among the officers. 
Stories have been told of headlong flight with the commander’s 
car out-stripping the rest of the field. Instances have been quoted 
of positions that were abandoned. There have been rumours 
that ‘every man for himself orders were issued by responsible 
authorities. I never, myself, witnessed these things, but one can 
account for the growth of a legend without being personally 
involved in its development. When a people has been defeated 
it always tries to smell out a traitor or two, or, at least, to find 
a few scapegoats on whom to fasten the responsibility for what 
has occurred. Still, let us admit (as I fear we must do) that such 
stories were not wholly groundless, that, as I have often heard 
my friends on the staff say, discipline at the front did break down. 
If that is so, then I think that the High Command was very 
largely to blame.[1]<br><br>
<b>106</b> The lower and middle commissioned ranks of the fighting 
formations were, to a very large extent, filled by elderly men 
who, in the years immediately preceding the outbreak of war, 
had been serving as garrison officers. Now, whatever some 
people may think, the illusion is still widely prevalent that 
constant inspections, peace-time exercises, and the hundred and 
one trivia of regimental duties are good training for those who 
will be called upon to lead men under conditions of active 
warfare in which ordinary day-to-day routine cannot be relied upon 
to bolster up authority. In actual fact the qualities necessary for 
success in the field are often better learned in many civilian 
occupations, because they, at least, do teach men to shoulder 
responsibilities and to adapt themselves to changing 
circumstances. Add to this the relaxing atmosphere which prevails in 
a world of minor officialdom—for this, after all, and questions 
of prestige apart, is what the life of many company and battalion 
commanders in time of peace amounts to. Only the genuine 
enthusiast, or the man with a strong sense of duty, is rendered 
immune to the poison, and such do not make up the bulk of any 
army. The period of waiting which lasted until 10 May was quite 
long enough for the authorities to have carried out the necessary 
changes, and to have set flowing that new blood which was so 
essential. There is no better protection against a hardening of the 
mental arteries than adaptable minds and physical keenness. 
Captain Coignet and his pupils of the Napoleonic Wars may not 
have been geniuses, but at least they were young. The German 
Army, too, even from the little we saw of it, gave, in comparison 
with our own, an impression of youthfulness. It soon became <b>107</b> 
perfectly obvious that the French military authorities had no 
intention whatever of putting through the needful pruning 
operations, nor were they sufficiently energetic in giving junior 
commissions (even if it meant having a certain number of subalterns 
supplementary to establishment) to those reserve N.C.O.s who 
had been proved by the events of 1914 to have admirable qualities 
of initiative, loyalty, and command. I know many cases in which 
colonels stopped such men from applying for commissions 
because they thought that they were too valuable to lose, or 
because (I am sorry to say) the candidates were not able to pull 
enough strings. It may have been assumed that the weeding-out 
process would get going automatically in the course of the 
fighting, but if that was so, then those responsible forgot that the war 
might very well not last for four years. They never dreamed that, 
in fact, it would be over in less time than was occupied, in 1914, 
by the ‘race to the sea’.<br><br>
I have already laid sufficient stress on the effects of surprise. 
I use the word in its strictly strategic sense. The worst cases of 
mental paralysis were the result of that mood of outraged 
amazement which laid hold of men who were faced by a rhythm of 
events entirely different from the kind of thing that they had 
been led to expect. From this form of psychological shock the 
officers of front-line formations were certainly not immune, but 
its ravages were most obvious farther back. There, as 
everywhere else, men could be found with sufficient determination to 
stand up even to the test of the unexpected, and I know of one 
town-major, wounded in the last war, who volunteered to go 
forward in an attempt to disengage a detachment of tanks. But 
unfortunately, the inevitable withdrawal of the front assumed, 
only too often, the character of a headlong flight, which, in some 
instances, developed even before the enemy had attacked. On 
one occasion G.H.Q. had to order back to his post the 
commander of a military region after he had abandoned, without 
instructions, the town in which his headquarters were situated. 
<b>108</b> He gave as his reason for having done so the excuse that he 
thought the Germans were too close! Weaknesses of this kind 
(and there are other examples) most certainly deserve to be 
condemned, though one cannot help feeling a certain amount 
of pity for the guilty parties. In other circumstances the men 
concerned would probably have acquitted themselves honourably 
enough. Unfortunately, Fate had placed them in positions where 
daily routine was but an extension of their peace-time habits. 
The mental atmosphere in which they moved had the stuffy 
quality of the office and the back area. They had long lived in 
the conviction that the terms of their service would keep them 
from the ‘front’. But the enemy broke the contract. Why had 
not somebody made it clear to these decent, conscientious men, 
most of whom were rather too old to be in harness, that in a war 
of movement there is always the risk that what to-day is the rear 
may turn out to-morrow to be the front?<br><br><br><br>
The worst feature of the whole thing was that this shakiness 
invaded the circles of those who had serious responsibilities to 
shoulder. Many of us were in a position to see with terror how 
appallingly quickly, almost overnight, it laid hold on certain 
officers who exercised the highest functions of the staff, and 
notably on those who were in charge of operations. The first 
symptoms of the disease were external—haggard eyes, badly 
shaven chins, a nervous restlessness which showed itself, in the 
early stages, as a feverish irritability over small things, and went 
on to assume the form of a forced calmness which deceived 
nobody. When a high-ranking officer started to say ‘What’s 
the use?’ it was time for the fighting troops to keep their eyes 
skinned. Very soon after that, the tide of despair began to rise, 
and, instead of stimulating men to renewed efforts, set them 
looking for refuge in a sort of nerveless, do-nothing apathy. I 
have seldom witnessed a more demoralizing spectacle than that 
of the way in which certain members of the ‘G’ branch seemed <b>109</b> 
to slump. There were times, of course, when they would clutch 
at the most unlikely straws, especially when the initiative of 
rescue was to come not from themselves but others. One whole 
day at Attiches stands out in my memory as having been filled 
with intoxicating optimism bred of a quite unfounded belief that 
a relieving army was advancing by forced marches on Arras and 
Bapaume. But these spasms of hope were followed by a still 
deeper drop in the temperature of determination. In this matter 
the high and mighty gave us the worst possible example. ‘Do 
anything you like, sir, but for Heaven’s sake do something!’ In 
those words, according to one of my colleagues who was present, 
a corps commander on one occasion addressed General Blanchard 
at Lens.<br><br>
I was to hear even worse things. No doubt I was indiscreet, 
though my intentions were innocent enough. The cause of the 
trouble lay in my nocturnal habits. All through the campaign I 
flatly refused to sleep in cellars, though not from any desire to 
gain a reputation for bravery. My refusal was carefully argued 
and had, I think, a basis of sound common sense, being founded 
upon a calculation of probabilities. I am, unfortunately, extremely 
prone to rheumatism. The chances that a night spent in the 
damp would leave me completely crippled were, I reckoned, 
about 90 per cent., whereas the risk of a direct hit on our 
headquarters building was considerably less. Besides, it was not 
always easy for me to find a convenient funk-hole. Ever since 
Lens we had been using stretchers instead of beds, and at the 
Château of Attiches I at first had mine put in my office on the 
ground floor. The choice, as things turned out, was unfortunate. 
Although I was not supposed to be on duty, it happened, two 
nights running, that generals, coming into the room and finding 
me there, woke me up to give them some item of information or 
to ask for guidance through the labyrinth of passages. I could 
hardly lie there and say, ‘Ask the next chap: this is my night off.’<br><br>
On the third night, which was that of 25/6 May, I decided to <b>110</b> 
do better. There was a whole series of bedrooms on the first 
floor reserved for senior officers, but between them ran a corridor 
which might be regarded as unoccupied. I had my stretcher 
carried upstairs, and, as soon as my work was finished, which, 
as a rule, was very late, went up to snatch a few hours’ rest.<br><br>
I was awakened very early next morning by the closing of a 
door and the sound of voices. Someone had just gone into the 
adjoining room and was carrying on a conversation with its 
occupant. Neither of the two speakers took the slightest trouble 
to lower his voice. To this day I do not know who the visitor 
was, but I am quite certain that he was somebody of exalted rank. 
His voice was unfamiliar to me, though I recognized only too 
well that of his companion. There could be no doubt that it was 
General Blanchard’s. In any case, the nature of their discussion 
would have served to remove any uncertainty I might have had 
on that point. In my innocence and my concern merely to find 
somewhere protected from draughts, I had snuggled down on 
the very threshold of the one room which I ought to have avoided 
like the plague. By the time I realized what was going on, it was 
too late to make my presence known. I could scarcely admit that 
I had accidentally overheard what was being said. Though I 
detest lying in any form, there was nothing for it but to pretend 
that I was asleep. Not that I had to do any such thing as it turned 
out, because no one discovered me. Meanwhile, the dialogue 
continued. I did not understand all of it, and, indeed, did not 
particularly try to. Much of what reached my ears I have 
forgotten. But there is one thing of which I am sure, absolutely 
sure, so sure that no amount of denial could ever shake my 
certainty. I distinctly heard General Blanchard say, more calmly 
than I could ever have thought possible: ‘I haven’t much doubt 
what 9s going to happen—double capitulation!’ At that time it 
was only 26 May, and we had the means, if not of saving 
ourselves, at least of putting up a long, heroic, and desperate 
resistance, as whole islands of men had done in 1918 when they 
<b>111</b> were surrounded on the Champagne front, and so of containing 
and exhausting a large number of German divisions. For days 
afterwards I carried the general’s words in my mind. They were 
a heavy secret, all the heavier because I could share them with 
nobody. They gave me the shudders: they still do.<br><br>
It is this spectre—now for once brought into the clear light 
of day—which has lain like a terrible shadow on the death- 
agonies of our armies in Flanders, nay, more, on all the French 
armies wherever found. ‘Capitulation’—a word that no true 
national leader would ever have brought himself to utter, even 
in the strictest confidence; a word that he would not even have 
thought. Nor would any true leader have spoken, as did a 
Marshal of France, till then aureoled with glory, on 17 June, of 
‘asking for a cessation of hostilities’ before, well before, he even 
knew the terms on which such a request would be granted. 
When one of my friends, a man of outstanding bravery, heard 
that famous and mournful pronouncement he said to me: ‘I 
should say that both you and I are pretty sure of ourselves. But 
it will be very difficult now to resist the temptation not to expose 
ourselves unduly. For what can be more tormenting than the 
fear of being killed at the very finish of a war? What sort of 
stomach for the fight is the average soldier going to have now?’ 
What, probably, more than anything else marks the true leader 
is the power to clench his teeth and hang on, the ability to impart 
to others a confidence that he feels himself. This he can do only 
if he does feel it. Never, until the very last moment, must he 
despair of his own genius. Above all, he must be willing to 
accept for the men under him, no less than for himself, sacrifices 
which may be productive of good, rather than a shameful 
yielding which must remain for ever useless. History tells us of men 
who were neither fools nor, in the matter of personal danger, 
cowards, but who, for all that, succumbed to misfortune, and on 
them its verdict has ever been one of contempt. ‘When I see 
what is going on all round us, I understand the behaviour of 
<b>112</b> Dupont at Baylen, and of Bazaine at Metz.’ That terrible sentence 
was spoken in my hearing towards the end of May by a young 
regimental officer. He should have limited his historical analogy 
to Bazaine, if it is true, as subsequent events seem to have proved, 
that the ultimate abandonment of all effort was due as much to 
party bias and base political ambitions as to momentary 
discouragement. In 1940 the spirit of Bazaine triumphed.<br><br>
If a leader is to stand firm against the onset of events, he needs, 
above all else, a healthy mind in a tough body. Bazaine was not 
only a politician, he was a worn-out man. The rapid collapse of 
morale in the High Command was, to a very large extent, due to 
the bad physical conditions in which its members worked. Even 
in the earty days at Valenciennes, when the situation, though 
admittedly serious, gave no cause for despair, many officers 
whose duty it was to make decisions of the highest importance 
suffered from too little sleep, hasty meals, and the lack of proper 
routine. They spent their days in rushing from office to office, 
producing mountains of paper, and never giving themselves a 
chance to think things out quietly. Unhurried planning alone 
could have saved us. No doubt they thought that by allowing 
themselves to become martyrs to their nerves they were giving 
proof of a fine stoicism, just as by living in a continual rush they 
produced in their own minds an illusion of activity. They forgot 
that nerves always take their revenge, and triat there can be no 
fruitful activity where there is no discipline of mind. Staff 
circles have always, even in time of peace, been over-fond of 
living in a perpetual atmosphere of fuss. They should have 
established, well in advance, a proper time-table of work. It 
would, of course, have had to be sufficiently elastic to meet the 
demands of battle, but some such fixed time-table ought to have 
been the ideal at which they aimed. Soldiers have always held 
up as a fine example old Joffre’s habit of, no matter what the 
circumstances, having a good night’s sleep. How much better 
it would have been if our leaders had taken a leaf out of his book.<br><br>
<b>113</b> What, however, it all comes back to, I am convinced, is that 
the system of education in which senior officers were trained was 
wholly wrong. They lacked toughness of fibre because their 
minds had not been properly conditioned. Several times, in the 
course of two wars separated by more than twenty years, I have 
heard senior officers, referring to the methods of training in 
which they were brought up, say, ‘The Staff College taught us 
all wrong.’ Not that its lessons had always been the same. 
Nothing in 1939,1 am sure, was more alien to our leaders’ minds 
than the military doctrine of Grandmaison—’that criminal’, as 
I heard one of them exclaim—which was so dear to the strategists 
of 1914. They were far from despising the value of heavy 
artillery, nor did they any longer believe in bayonet charges 
against fortified positions, or in the theory of the offensive at all 
costs. But no matter how much the things taught may have 
changed, the method of teaching them was the same, and that is 
what really matters.<br><br>
Captain T ..., a sceptic if ever there was one, but, for all that, 
a born leader, was never tired of inveighing comically against 
the ‘general ideas’ a respect for which had been the main tenet of 
the creed with which his professors at the Staff College had tried 
to imbue him. ‘There are no such things as general ideas.’ I am 
not prepared to defend this contention, but what is true, and what 
Captain T . . . meant, is that in the field of the positive and 
technical sciences, ideas are of value only in so far as they mirror 
or sum up the concrete facts of a situation. If they do not do that 
they remain mere verbal counters having no connexion with 
actuality. Now every educationist knows well, and an historian 
perhaps better than most, that there can be no greater danger in 
teaching than to let words usurp the place of facts. That mistake 
is all the more fatal when one remembers that the young are 
temperamentally only too prone to become intoxicated by words, 
and to give them the validity of things. Just because staff officers 
are the intellectuals of the Army, and, knowing it, inclined to 
<b>114</b> assume airs of superiority, they are—or so I have found it— 
more than most men, susceptible to ready-made formulae. There 
was, for instance, my old colonel, a man who had done brilliantly 
at the Staff College. I remember how, in 1916, when we were on 
our way up to the line previous to taking part in an offensive 
from which he was destined never to return, he said to me: ‘It ‘s 
a terrible thing to have to fight a war in one’s own country’, and 
then, hurriedly correcting himself, ‘not that it really matters 
where a war is fought. A soldier’s first duty is to destroy the 
enemy wherever found.’ Our ruined crops, our factories in the 
enemy’s hands, our mineral resources employed in turning out 
guns for the Germans—all these things ceased to matter to him 
once he could take refuge in a text-book dictum. In the best 
pages of a terribly uneven work, Taine has shown that the main 
characteristic of Napoleon’s genius was his power of always 
being able to see the truth behind the appearance. I am afraid 
that our modern successors of Napoleon have lost this sovereign 
art. At Rennes, on 17 June, our High Command fancied that 
they were still exercising it, when all they were really doing was 
to succumb to the heady influence of the word ‘position’.<br><br>
When a lesson has been merely learned passively, its effects 
are apt to be fleeting. What one has to teach strikes deeper roots 
into the mind. Scarcely one of our leaders, or the colleagues with 
whom I worked, but had, at some time or other, and more or less 
frequently, gone back to the college as an instructor. Of all the 
sports practised in the Army, the sport of schoolmastering is the 
most popular, whether it takes the form of lecturing junior 
N.C.O.s or enunciating learned theories to candidates for the 
staff. The Corps of Officers is a humming pedagogic hive. 
Since I myself belong to the teaching profession, and have been 
instructing others for a good deal longer, alas, than I care to 
remember, I can rightly claim to have an opinion on such matters, 
and my opinion is that one should always treat the utterances of 
old schoolmasters with caution. They are forced by the 
circum-<b>115</b>stances of their job to amass a whole collection of verbal patterns, 
and on these they come, in the long run, to depend, as on so 
many secure nails, many of which are not wholly free from rust. 
Furthermore, being men of faith and doctrine, they are inclined, 
though without always realizing it, to favour the docile pupil at 
the expense of the aggressive sceptic. Very few of them keep 
their minds supple enough to retain the power of criticizing 
their own prejudices. Few of them succeed in escaping altogether 
the pitfalls of their calling. This is always dangerous, and 
particularly so when their listeners are also their subordinates in rank. 
For then contradiction is interpreted as indiscipline. The upper 
reaches of the staff swarmed, in my day, with former professors, 
and most of the operational chiefs were men who had once 
figured among their most promising pupils. These were not the 
best conditions, perhaps, in which to learn adaptability to new 
situations.<br><br>
I am fully aware that Staff-College pupils had to learn a great 
many subjects. I have handled many of the official syllabuses 
and know how crammed they are with figures, calculations, 
details of artillery ranging and fuel consumption—matters, all 
of them, I do not doubt, of the highest possible importance. 
They were, as a rule, very thoroughly mastered. But there was, 
in addition, the War-Game, the indispensable, the dangerous 
War-Game—how dangerous one realizes only when one has 
seen teachers and pupils alike handling bodies of troops on the 
map with the help of a comforting array of multicoloured arrows. 
It needs an extremely imaginative mind to keep fast hold of the 
facts behind the symbols, to see and feel the reality of all the 
discomforts that beset the slowly marching column, the many 
incidents that may occur when troops are on the move, the effect 
of artillery fire, the frustration of inevitable delays, the misery 
caused when hot food is not ready at the right time, the 
embarrassments that may occur when guides lose their way or generals 
their heads. Only the most elastic of minds can make sufficient 
<b>116</b> allowance for the unexpected—which means, in most cases, for 
what the enemy will do.<br><br>
For the enemy is for the strategist a constant headache, and 
obviously, every soldier is primarily concerned with trying to 
anticipate his movements and, thereby, to counter them. 
Unfortunately, in this war, as formerly in 1914 or again in the spring 
of 1917 just before the Nivelles offensive, the enemy, because 
we had never learned enough about him, rarely did what we 
expected him to do. I do not think that this was chiefly due to 
any lack of prevision on our part. On the contrary, our prevision 
was almost too detailed. The trouble was that it covered only a 
limited number of possibilities. God knows, we had worked 
hard enough at perfecting ‘Operation Dyle\ My own part in 
the planning was modest enough, but I could still explain in 
detail—if my files had not been burned—precisely how my fuel 
dumps in Belgium were to be organized on Zero-plus-9. What 
had not been foreseen was that when Zero-plus-9 arrived, I 
should no longer have any fuel dumps in Belgium, and precious 
few in our own back areas—and for a very good reason. The 
chief defect of the system lay in the fact that officers had been 
taught at peace-time lectures to attach too much importance to 
manœuvre and to theoretical tactics: in other words, to book- 
knowledge. Unconsciously they had got into the habit of 
expecting that everything would happen as the manuals said it would. 
When the Germans refused to play the game according to Staff- 
College rules, they found themselves as much at sea as the public 
speaker who is faced by questions to which he has not been 
taught the answers. They thought that everything was lost, and, 
therefore, acquiesced in the loss. When one has become too 
much fuddled by words and theories, the only safe guide is a 
sense of the facts, a power to make decisions, and an ability to 
improvise. It is precisely those things that a too hard-and-fast 
method of training fails to inculcate. <br><br>
What strategical training in all countries needs and rarely gets 
<b>117</b> is a sound basis of actuality. This can be found only in the lessons 
of history. How could it be otherwise? The military art is 
one of those technical subjects that precludes the possibility of 
experiment. The man who designs a new type of motor-car and 
wants to see how his ideas are likely to work out has only to 
construct a model. But what happens when a professor of the 
art of war wants to study the behaviour of two armies of a given 
type on the battlefield? He can scarcely mobilize tens of thousands 
of men, organize them according to his theories, and set them to 
butcher one another. There are, of course, manœuvres, but just 
because no one gets killed in these ‘miniature wars’—as they 
used to be called—they give a completely distorted view of actual 
warfare. The more they are made to resemble the ‘real thing’, 
the more grotesque, as a rule, are the results. In these 
circumstances, the only sensible thing is to fall back on the lessons of 
the past, and to learn from them what, in other fields, we should 
find out by experimenting.<br><br>
Is it fair to hold history responsible for the weaknesses of our 
strategic planning? It has sometimes been asked whether the 
lessons of history have not led us astray. I heard that doubt 
expressed by a young officer, recently graduated from the Staff 
College, at the end of our stay in Normandy, when the dark 
shadow of defeat was already upon us. If, by voicing it, he 
meant to question the value of the so-called history lessons he 
had received, I have no quarrel with his scepticism. But this 
teaching never, really, had anything to do with history. It was, 
if I may say so, at the very opposite pole from the science it 
was supposed to be inculcating. History is, in its essentials, the 
science of change. It knows and it teaches that it is impossible 
to find two events that are ever exactly alike, because the 
conditions from which they spring are never identical. I do not mean 
to deny that it recognizes certain elements in the evolution of 
mankind which, though not permanent, are extremely long- 
lived. But even while it lays this down, it has to admit that the 
<b>118</b> possible number of their combinations is almost infinite. It 
realizes, properly enough, that successive civilizations show 
certain repetitive patterns, and that these resemble one another 
in their general lines, if not in their details, when the conditions 
determining them may be said to have a family likeness. It can 
even try to see into the future, and not always, I think, 
unsuccessfully. But the lesson it teaches is not that what happened 
yesterday will necessarily happen to-morrow, or that the past 
will go on reproducing itself. By examining how and why 
yesterday differed from the day before, it can reach conclusions 
which will enable it to foresee how to-morrow will differ from 
yesterday. The traces left by past events never move in a straight 
line, but in a curve that can be extended into the future. It 
matters not at all that the very nature of its subject-matter 
forbids the sort of experimentation which is possible in other fields 
of science. Observation and analysis enable it to establish the 
relations obtaining between events which are complicated by a 
whole series of surface variations. It establishes, by its study of 
them, a science of causes, and traces the different effects those 
causes may produce. History is, in the truest sense, an 
experimental science, because, by studying real events, and by 
bringing intelligence to bear on problems of analytical comparison, 
it succeeds in discovering, with ever-increasing accuracy, the 
parallel movements of cause and effect. The physicist does not 
say, ‘Oxygen is a gas because we never come across it in any 
other form’; what he says is: ‘Oxygen, in the conditions of 
temperature and pressure which most generally obtain in the 
atmosphere of our universe, shows itself in gaseous form.’ 
Similarly, the historian is well aware that no two successive wars 
are ever the same war, because, in the period between them, a 
number of modifications have occurred in the social structures 
of the countries concerned, in the progress of technical skill, and 
in the minds of men.<br><br>
No worse charge can be brought against the teaching of 
<b>119</b> history as almost invariably practised in our military schools 
than this—that it persuaded our army leaders of 1914 to expect 
the war then imminent to resemble the wars fought by Napoleon, 
and those of twenty-five years later that the war of 1939 would 
be a repetition of the war of 1914. I once glanced through the 
famous lectures delivered by Foch round about—if my memory 
is correct—the year 1910. Rarely has any book so thoroughly 
upset me. I do not deny that his analysis of Napoleonic tactics 
was admirable. But he did not stop at analysing them. He 
exhibited them as models to be followed irrespective of any 
changes that might have taken place in the world since Napoleon’s 
day. He may, here and there, have made a passing reference to 
differences in armament and changes in topography. But such 
mild comments are not enough. Before embarking on any of his 
descriptions he should have uttered a loud note of warning. ‘For 
Heaven’s sake’—he should have told his audience—’don’t rush 
to conclusions. I am about to analyse in detail battles that were 
fought over ground which had fewer roads than you would find 
in it to-day. And over such roads as there were transport moved 
at a speed which had scarcely, if at all, increased since medieval 
times. The fire-strength of the opposing armies was tiny 
compared with what we, to-day, can produce, and the bayonet was 
still the queen of weapons because neither the machine-gun nor 
barbed wire had then been invented. If we can still draw lessons 
from these actions, they will be of value only if you remember 
that wherever such new factors as I have mentioned play a part, 
the experience of an earlier day, when they were unknown, is 
worth almost nothing at all/ I have, I confess, only a very 
superficial acquaintance with the published works and spoken 
words of Foch’s successors, but what little I do know of them 
bears out my suspicion that the spirit of their teaching has not 
noticeably changed.<br><br>
Still, the High Command of 1914 did become the High 
Command of 1918. In spite of many bloody errors it learned to modify 
<b>120</b> its methods and to adapt them to changing circumstance. Early 
in 1918 General Gouraud, an enthusiastic and ingenious educator, 
paraded two companies of infantry before a mixed class of officers, 
of whom I was one. The first of these two companies was 
equipped with the weapons, and performed the evolutions, of 
1914. The other was of an entirely new type, armed, organized, 
and handled in accordance with the latest theories. The contrast 
was startling. But what was shown us that day was but an 
example taken from a fairly low stratum of the military pyramid. 
Actually, the change-over in method had brought about a 
revolutionary change in almost the entire conduct of war. How 
came it, then, that our leaders of 1940 were incapable of showing 
the same willingness to learn in the hard school of fact?<br><br>
It would be foolish, in this connexion, to ignore the striking 
difference in duration which marked the two historical events of 
which I am speaking. Is it fair to expect that in a war of rapid 
movement men will have time to learn the lessons of their initial 
mistakes? The military authorities of 1914-18 were given a 
breathing-space of four years. We had only a few weeks. It 
would have needed a man of outstanding genius to change the 
whole conception of his strategy after the battle had been joined, 
and even had such a genius been available, the material ready to 
his hand would have made any such drastic action impossible. 
No, the new elements of the strategic problem should have 
been taken to heart before the outbreak of hostilities. But for 
most men the amount of intellectual effort involved in adapting 
themselves, in advance, to a set of circumstances conjured up 
merely as the result of a shrewd analysis of a given situation, is 
probably far greater and more difficult of achievement than the 
practical reorientation forced upon them empirically by the 
necessities of a concrete set of facts.<br><br>
This, however, does not explain everything, and, as an excuse, 
it is insufficient. No one will readily believe that we had remained, 
all through the period of peace, in complete ignorance of what 
<b>121</b> was happening in the German Army, or of the theories on which 
it was being trained. Besides, we had had before our eyes, ever 
since the summer of 1939, the practical lessons of the Polish 
campaign. They were clear, simple, and relevant. For what the 
Germans did later in the West was precisely what they had done 
earlier in the East. They made us a present of eight months of 
inactivity, and those eight months should have been used by us 
in thinking out afresh the whole strategic problem and in putting 
through the necessary reforms. We failed to take advantage of 
this opportunity. Why? Before making any effort to answer 
that question, I must make brief reference to a human and 
psychological factor of no little importance.<br><br>
Who <i>were</i> our leaders in 1940? Corps and army commanders 
who had fought the last war in charge of battalions and regiments. 
Who were their chief assistants?—men who had commanded 
companies in 1918. All these officers had remained, though not 
always to the same extent, dominated by their memories of the 
last war. Nor can that be wondered at. Not only had they 
relived those glorious days a hundred times in books or lectures: 
not only had they based on them a whole curriculum of military 
education. They were soaked in them to the very marrow of 
their bones. Thoughts of the last war clung to them because they 
were the thoughts of their youth. Those long dead days had all 
the brilliance of things seen. A chord was struck in the minds of 
those men which called forth a resonant echo from the emotional 
recollection of their past. Incidents which, for others, served 
merely to illustrate some objective lesson in strategy were, for 
them, as for all of us who had known those years of fighting, 
unforgettable reminders of personal dangers faced and 
overcome, of friends killed at our side, of the fury we had felt at 
orders badly drafted, of the intoxication which had taken hold 
of us when we saw the enemy in flight. Many of them must, in 
1915 or 1917, have led their men over the top in attacks on 
trenches which our guns had failed to flatten. They had only to 
<b>122</b> close their eyes to see again the bodies caught in the wire and 
riddled with machine-gun bullets. A little later, promoted to the 
staff, they had helped to plan those cumbersome and carefully 
thought-out operations which, one day, were to end in victory— 
the winning of the Malmaison plateau which had been, as it were, 
the testing-ground for new and revolutionary tactics; Gouraud’s 
defence in depth on 15 July 1918. Ill prepared by the 
instructions they had received or had given to others, to understand, 
instinctively, the working of the irresistible law of change, only 
a rare elasticity of mind could have enabled them to fight 
free from the influence of things once seen and deeds once 
accomplished. Everything, on the contrary, conspired to make 
them think that they need only avoid the mistakes which had so 
nearly lost the last war to win the next one; that they had merely 
to repeat the methods which, when first tried out, had brought 
success. I remember writing to a friend, some time in February, 
as follows: ‘One thing is certain: if the High Command makes 
mistakes this time, they will not be the same mistakes as were 
made in the Champagne offensive or the Nivelles attack.’ Alas! 
the field of possible mistakes is limitless. What, yesterday, was 
wisdom may become, to-morrow, the worst of follies.<br><br>
Doubtless the magic of the past would have had far less power 
over brains less stiffened by age. It was borne in on me, ever 
more and more clearly as the campaign developed, that the 
younger staff officers, most of whom had not served in the earlier 
war, almost always saw things more clearly than their seniors. 
Those, it is true, who had been too brilliant as pupils remained 
obstinately loyal to what they had been taught, and they, 
unfortunately, were the men who filled the most important posts. 
There were not a few, on the contrary, who had formerly sworn 
by the words of the master, but now showed an increasing 
tendency to throw off the intellectual shackles of an education 
which they were beginning to judge with severity. Even among 
the mature, but by no means elderly, officers who <i>had</i> fought in 
<b>123</b> 1914 or in 1918, there were some who were still capable of 
absorbing new ideas. But they counted for little. The High 
Command was dominated by old men.<br><br>
The methods of promotion followed in peace-time, which 
make men battalion-commanders at forty, had given us generals 
of sixty. As frequently happens, these ancient fossils, loaded 
with honours and sometimes trailing clouds of former glory, 
quite forgot that in those happy days of achievement they had 
been young. Consequently, their chief concern was to bar their 
juniors from the broad road to advancement. Insufficient public 
attention has been given, on the whole, to the law which, shortly 
before the outbreak of the present war, created two new grades 
in the military hierarchy. For a long time there was no higher 
rank than that of General of Division. It was left to G.H.Q. to 
determine what function officers holding that rank should 
perform, and they might just as likely be appointed to the command 
of an army, or even to that of all the armies, as to a corps, or, 
still more logically, a division. There’ can, however, be no real 
paradise without a pyramid of steps about the celestial throne. 
So, one fine day it was decided that the posts of Corps or Army 
Generals, formerly mere functions, should carry with them a 
definite rank. This, it may be said, was a harmless sop to the 
vanity of a few men who were rather childishly hungry for 
distinctions. Actually, it was far from harmless, because once 
the question of rank comes into the picture, it follows as a 
matter of discipline that active command shall go to the senior 
soldier. It became, henceforward, impossible for a young 
divisional commander, say, to be given an army, unless he had 
been first promoted to the rank, at the very least, of General of a 
Corps, because, once in charge of his new formation, he would, 
by definition, have under him men who already held that grade. 
Now, the movement from one grade to another is controlled by 
rules, or at least by usages, which make it much more difficult 
for an officer to be promoted than merely to be given a new 
<b>124</b> appointment. The members of the War Council, raised, all of 
them, by the very reform which, doubtless, they had themselves 
initiated, to the new dignity of Generals of Armies, could 
therefore hope to keep in their own hands, no matter what might 
happen, the leadership of the Nation in Arms. Had this system 
been in operation during the last war, it is extremely improbable 
that we should ever have seen a young lieutenant-colonel of 
1914, called Debeney, leading the First Army in 1918 to the 
victories of Montdidier and Saint-Quentin, or Colonel Pétain— 
the Pétain of our youth—flaming through the hierarchy like a 
prairie-fire, until he reached the topmost pinnacle of all, and 
ended, one fine summer morning, by marching under the Arc de 
Triomphe at the head of all the soldiers of France.<br><br>
When, therefore, after the first setbacks, murmurs began to 
get around that perhaps the High Command was not wholly 
blameless, to whom did the Army turn in its search for young 
blood and energetic leadership? The Chief of Staff of one of the 
generalissimos of the former war was made Commander-in- 
Chief, while another of those generalissimos was appointed as 
his techhical adviser. The first of these gentlemen had held the 
post of Vice-President of the War Council, the second, at about 
the same time, had been Minister for War. In other words, both 
of them had been in some degree responsible for the very methods 
which had just been proved to be so shatteringly inadequate.<br><br>
So completely dominated were our military, and even our 
civil, governors by the superstition of age, and by the respect due 
to a prestige which, though certainly venerable, ought, if only 
for its own self-protection, to have been laid in the purple shroud 
befitting dead gods, that they became the victims of a false cult, 
and bowed in homage to an incarnation of experience which, 
just because it drew its so-called lessons from the past, was almost 
bound to misinterpret the present. True, one of the more 
recently promoted Generals of Brigade was called in to advise 
the Government, but what did he do? I do not actually know, 
<b>125</b> but I very much fear that among the glorious constellations of 
that much-studded sky, his two poor little stars did not shine 
very brightly. The Committee of Public Safety would have 
made him Commander-in-Chief. As it was, our war, up to the 
very end, was a war of old men, or of theorists who were bogged 
down in errors engendered by the faulty teaching of history. It 
was saturated by the smell of decay rising from the Staff College, 
the offices of a peace-time General Staff, and the barrack-square. 
The world belongs to those who are in love with the new. That 
is why our High Command, finding itself face to face with 
novelty, and being quite incapable of seizing its opportunities, 
not only experienced defeat, but, like boxers who have run to 
fat and are thrown off their balance by the first unexpected blow, 
accepted it.<br><br>
But our leaders would not have succumbed so easily to that 
spirit of apathy which wise theologians have ever held to be 
among the worst of sins, had they merely entertained doubts of 
their own competence. In their hearts, they were only too ready 
to despair of the country they had been called upon to defend, 
and of the people who furnished the soldiers they commanded.<br><br>
At this point I leave the purely military field. The roots of a 
misunderstanding so grave that we cannot but rank it among the 
main causes of our disaster, must be sought elsewhere and at a 
much deeper level.<br><br><br><br>
<b>126</b> <br><br>
<b><center>Chapter Three</b></center><br><br>
<b><center>A FRENCHMAN EXAMINES HIS CONSCIENCE</b></center><br><br>
IN no nation is any professional group ever entirely responsible 
for its own actions. The solidarity of society as a whole is too 
strong to permit the existence of the sort of moral autonomy, 
existing in isolation, which any such total responsibility would 
seem to imply. The staffs worked with tools which were put 
into their hands by the nation at large. The psychological 
conditions in which they lived were not altogether of their own making, 
and they themselves, through their members, were as their 
origins had moulded them. They could be only what the totality 
of the social fact, as it existed in France, permitted them to be. 
That is why I cannot rest content with what I have so far 
written. I trust that I am honest: certainly, I have done my best 
to describe, in the terms of my own experience, what I believe to 
have been the vices of our military system, and the part played 
by them in the defeat of my country. But, unless I am to be 
guilty of betraying a trust, I must go farther. The very nature 
of my inquiry makes it necessary that the evidence of the 
soldier be balanced and completed by the self-examination of the 
Frenchman.<br><br>
I do not joyfully or lightly embark on this part of my task. 
As a Frenchman I feel constrained, in speaking of my country, 
to say of her only what is good. It is a harsh duty that compels 
a man to make a public show of his mother’s weaknesses when 
she is in misery and despair. As an historian, I know better than 
do most men how difficult it is to conduct an analysis which, if 
it is to have any value, must be concerned with a complex of 
causes, remote, involved, and, in the present state of sociological 
science, extremely difficult to uncover. But personal scruples 
<b>127</b> are, in this matter, wholly unimportant. My children, when they 
read this balance-sheet of history, the unknown friends into 
whose hands it may some day come, must not be allowed to 
reproach its author with having played tricks with truth, of 
having condemned a number of glaring faults, while, at the same 
time, maintaining a deliberate silence about errors for which 
every citizen was, in part, responsible.<br><br><br><br>
The men at the front are rarely satisfied with their companions 
in the rear. It needs an unusually large dose of generosity, when 
one is sleeping on the hard ground, to forgive old friends the 
comfort of their beds, or, when machine-guns are rat-tatting 
over one’s head, to think without bitterness of the prosperous 
security of shops still crammed with customers and the peaceful 
delights of provincial cafés to the habitués of which war means 
no more than leisurely discussions of points of strategical theory. 
It is when battle ends in disaster that the gulf separating these 
two halves of the nation threatens to become permanent. The 
soldier is only too conscious of the sacrifices he has been called 
upon to make. If they turn out to have been useless, that, he 
feels, is not his responsibility. His leaders, ever fearful of his 
criticism, encourage him to find scapegoats anywhere rather than 
in the Army. Thus is born the fatal legend of the ‘stab in the 
back’ which reactionary movements and military coups d’état 
always find so useful. I hope that in what I have so far written 
I have made it clear that some, at least, of the veterans of 1940 
will refuse to listen to such sowers of discord. But it is no use 
pretending that the back areas were not, to some extent, as 
deserving of blame as the armies. 
But were there, could there, in fact, be any back areas, using 
that term in the sense which is normally attached to it? France 
in arms between the years 1915 and 1918 was composed of 
several slices of territory arranged in depth. On the map of 
danger each was coloured differently. First came the scorched 
<b>128</b> zone of the front line. It did not, of course, remain static, but 
any withdrawal which might take it, say, from the outskirts of 
Saint-Quentin to the suburbs of Noyon, seemed to us a pretty 
serious matter. Yet in mere distance the area of retreat meant no 
more than half an hour’s run by car. Slightly farther back was 
the ‘advanced rear’, a thinnish strip in which lay our rest billets, 
still relatively exposed to attack. Last of all came the real rear, 
stretching to infinity: a place of quiet towns and unravaged fields. 
Now and again, to be sure, some sudden alarm—usually regarded 
as providing a mild cause of scandal—might, for a moment or 
two, trouble the peace of this happy refuge. A Junker might fly 
over Paris, a Zeppelin might drop a few bombs, Big Bertha might 
unexpectedly hit the ornamental water in a public park, or, with 
more tragic success, the pillars of a church. Crouching in the 
trenches we trembled for the safety of our families. But what 
were such trivial occurrences compared with our more recent 
memories?<br><br>
For air bombardment and the speed of modern war have 
completely disarranged our pattern of familiar dangers. No 
stretch of sky is nowadays devoid of menace, and motorized 
elements, against which no fixed ‘line’ is ever proof, eat up the 
miles. In the space of a few minutes hundreds of people met 
their deaths at Rennes, that town of Brittany where, only 
yesterday, one would have thought oneself to be as safe from 
war’s alarms as in the heart of America. The roads of Berry 
were swept by machine-gun fire, and the bullets treated soldier 
and child alike. These things are true enough, but I sometimes 
wonder whether such horrors are quite the novelty that some 
suppose. In its power of wreaking concentrated destruction, 
and, especially, in its speed of movement, the bomber of the 
skies has, I admit, no precedent in history. But only a relatively 
short time ago it was the common thing for war to pile up more 
victims in the stripped and starving fields, in the streets of looted 
cities, than in the ranks of the actual combatants. Men’s memories 
<b>129</b> are short. Such times are real only to a handful of old fogies who 
live out their lives among the musty tomes of ancient libraries. 
The average human being finds in the immediate past a 
convenient screen to set between himself and the distant truths of 
history. It keeps him from realizing that the embalmed tragedies 
of an older day may once again become realities. It was only, he 
thinks, in the Dark Ages that war brought death to any but the 
fighting men. Quite recently, the civil populations of the back 
areas, and those whose duties lay in offices and depots, really 
believed that there was a difference, in terms of danger, between 
front and rear.<br><br>
Not but what we had every reason to be sceptical, and I 
believe that most men, in their secret hearts, were shaken in 
their comfortable faith. We had been warned. Had not the 
news-reels shown us terrible pictures of Spain in ruins? Had not 
correspondent after correspondent told us of the martyrdom 
suffered by the cities of Poland? In a sense we had been over- 
warned: of that I am convinced. Enemy propaganda was adept 
in harping on the single string of aerial bombardment. Paris 
might have been defended; the old superstition about ‘open 
cities’ might not, to the extent it did, have hampered operations, 
if only the fate of Madrid, of Nankin, of Warsaw had not been 
so vivid in the public eye. We had been told enough about it 
all to be afraid, but not enough, and not in the right way, to 
make us accept the inevitable, to make us realize that civilian 
morale must be adapted to these new, or, rather, to these 
resuscitated, conditions of war.<br><br>
I am not, I think, temperamentally insensitive to the claims of 
pity, though what I saw with my own eyes in two successive 
wars may have somewhat deadened my responses. But one thing 
I shall never be able to witness unmoved—the look of terror on 
the faces of children running in village streets from falling bombs. 
I pray God that I may never again have to see <i>that</i>, whether in 
reality or in my dreams. It is intolerable that war should involve 
<b>130</b> the very young—not only because in them the hope of the future 
lies, but because in their weakness and their irresponsibility they 
make so confident an appeal to our protection. Christian legend 
would not, I think, have been so hard on Herod if he had been 
guilty only of the Baptist’s death. The crime for which he could 
never find pardon was the Massacre of the Innocents.<br><br>
Confronted by the nation’s peril and by the duties that it lays 
on every citizen, all adults are equal, and only a curiously warped 
mind would claim for any of them the privilege of immunity. 
What, after all, is a ‘civilian’ in time of war? He is nothing more 
than a man whose weight of years, whose health, whose 
profession (if it be judged essential to the well-being of his country) 
prevents him from bearing arms effectively. To find himself thus 
kept from serving his fellows in the one way that any citizen 
would wish to do is a misfortune for any man. Why should it 
confer on him the right to escape from the common danger? In 
a few years from now I shall be too old for mobilization. My 
sons will take my place. Am I, therefore, to conclude that my 
life has become more precious than theirs? Far better, on the 
contrary, that their youth should be preserved, if necessary, at 
the cost of my grey hairs. Herodotus said, a long time ago, that 
the great impiety of war is that it forces fathers to consign their 
children to the tomb. Should it be a matter of complaint for us 
that Nature’s law has once more come into its own? For the 
nation at large there can be no worse tragedy than having to 
sacrifice those very lives on which her destiny reposes. Against 
the strength of those young bodies we others weigh but lightly 
in the scale. Nor do I except the women, save only those young 
mothers whose survival is necessary in the interests of their 
children. Girls to-day laugh at the swooning habits of their 
grandmothers. They are right to do so, and I am certain that 
courage in them is no less natural than in us, nor less a duty. In 
the days of professional armies the soldier, whether knight or 
mercenary, shed his blood for his patron, and for this service the 
<b>131</b> non-combatants paid in rents and wages. If he put their safety 
in peril they had a just ground of complaint, for the contract had 
been broken. To-day, when every fit man is a soldier, no one in 
the menaced city can escape the tedium and the risks. To share 
them is his bounden duty. To maintain otherwise is mere 
sentimentality—or cowardice.<br><br>
These self-evident truths are so simple that one feels a certain 
shame at having to call men’s attention to them. But were they 
generally understood in the course of those months through 
which we lived but recently? I find it hard to believe. Too many 
mayors thought it their duty to ask that their towns should 
not be defended; too many leaders, military as well as civilian, 
were only too willing to act in accordance with this fallacious 
conception of the public interest. Truth to tell, such timid souls 
were not moved solely by the wish—in itself admirable—to save 
human lives. The fearful destruction of property that had 
accompanied the war of 1914-18 left bitter memories. Everybody 
knew that the artistic heritage of the country had been cruelly 
mutilated, and our national prosperity to a large extent 
compromised. There was a feeling that it would be better to accept 
any humiliation rather than undergo a second time this twin 
impoverishment. It was a strange form of wisdom that did not 
even ask whether, in fact, there could be any worse catastrophe, 
for our culture or for the system of our economic life, than to 
let ourselves be conquered by a robber society.<br><br>
A day came when the decision was taken to declare all cities 
of more than 20,000 inhabitants ‘open’. That a village lived in 
by poor yokels should be bombed, smashed, and burned was, 
apparently, a matter of indifference to the noble apostles of 
humanity who upheld this view. But a city of solid tradesmen 
was quite another matter!... And so it came about that while the 
cadets of Saumur were being killed on the Loire, the enemy had 
already cut the bridges behind them at Nantes, because these 
were regarded as being ‘out of bounds’. It is no good mincing 
<b>132</b> words. This timidity of the nation at large was, no doubt, in 
many cases but the sum of the timidity of individuals. There 
were cases of officials leaving their posts without orders. Many 
instructions to evacuate were issued before they need have been. 
A sort of frenzy of flight swept over the whole country. It was 
no rare thing, along the roads crowded with refugees, to come 
on complete local fire-brigades perched on their engines. At the 
first rumour of the enemy’s advance, off they had rushed to find 
safety for their persons and their property. I am convinced that 
they had been told to do so. Their towns could perish in the 
flames, provided the means of mastering the blaze could be got 
out of the danger-zone. . . . Such, it will be said, are ever the 
charming ways of bureaucracy. Alas! the evil went a great deal 
deeper than that. I know of at least one industrial centre where, 
on the approach of the German columns, the managers hastily 
abandoned the factories without even bothering to see that their 
work-people were paid. Had they been called up for service in 
one of the armed services, they would probably have stuck 
gamely to their posts. But they were ‘civilians’, and, as such, 
they forgot, or had not been sufficiently reminded, that in time 
of war private professional interests no longer exist. When the 
nation is in arms, only one thing matters—the fighting front.<br><br>
Am I wrong? Am I, too, guilty of yielding to that fond 
temptation of the old who, remembering the days of their youth, 
too readily underestimate their juniors? I have a feeling that, 
even among the men of military age, something had been lost 
of that fervent fraternity in danger which meant so much to most 
of us in the old 1914 days. There can be little doubt that people 
had grown to regard certain causes of ‘exemption’ not as 
tiresome and rather humiliating necessities, but as privileges, almost 
as ‘rights’. Too often the word had gone out to workers on the 
land, ‘Why should factory hands get out of it, and not you?’; 
to fathers of families, ‘Your first concern is your duty to your 
children’; to veterans of the last war, ‘Twice in a lifetime is 
<b>133</b> really <i>too</i> much!’ When the Ministry of Munitions was 
reorganized and expanded, the spectacle of a lot of reserve officers 
pelting along as hard as they could go for the comfortable 
security of its office chairs made us feel slightly sick. Off they 
went, crying as they took their leave of us, ‘It really is an awful 
bore, but it seems they can’t do without us!’ Were they, all of 
them, quite so indispensable? Could not they, sometimes at 
least, have been replaced by older men? I frequently heard well- 
meaning persons express the hope that at least our young 
intellectuals should this time be spared the sacrifices which had 
decimated their ranks during the last war. In my ears, I must 
confess, this sentiment had a false ring. It was terrible, no doubt, 
that so many young hopefuls should have perished on the Marne, 
the Yser, and the Somme. The wound thus given to the 
intellectual life of the nation has never ceased to bleed. But, once the 
issue of arms had been joined, was there nothing to be set in the 
opposite balance? Surely, nothing could have been worse for 
intellectual freedom, for national culture, for moral health, than 
defeat? When sacrifice is the order of the day, any exception 
should be out of the question. No one is justified in regarding 
his own life as of more value than the lives of his neighbours. 
Once that sort of doubt is allowed to creep in, each one of us, in 
his own sphere, whether it be great or small, can always find 
perfectly legitimate reasons for regarding himself as 
‘indispensable’.<br><br>
I do not know what part this desire to spare the young may 
have played in the curious reluctance of the authorities to raise 
and train recruits. At the moment of the final catastrophe most 
of the 1940 class had only just been called up. They had, for 
practical purposes, received no useful instruction of any kind. 
In most of the big cities no attempt had been made to provide 
preliminary training for the younger boys, many of whom asked 
for nothing better than to be allowed to follow in the footsteps 
of their elders. Where did the responsibility for this incredible 
<b>134</b> negligence lie?—with the High Command or with the Civil 
Government? (But, surely, if the soldiers had insisted, they 
could have got their way?) I do not know what the motives were 
that underlay this decision. Are we really to believe that the 
interminable period of waiting, with its almost negligible losses, 
had rendered our leaders forgetful of the need to have ready 
trained the reserves on whom they would have to count once 
the real fighting had begun? If that is so, then it was not the 
least disastrous of the many results of that ‘bogged-down’ period 
of the war—as the Germans called it—which we had so foolishly 
welcomed at the time. ‘The real trouble is, we’ve got too many 
men’ said an officer to one of my friends who, when he was sent 
home on the grounds that he had got a growing family, had asked 
to be allowed to remain with the colours. Was it feared that we 
should not have sufficient equipment?—or was it that, haunted 
by the memory of that unfortunate class of 1916 which we had 
seen, with tears in our eyes, flung into the furnace of the Somme 
almost straight from school, the authorities had—as I thought 
at the time—yielded to the claims of a somewhat excessive 
sentimentality? Whatever the reasons, there can be no doubt that 
our governors, both individually and as a class, did lack 
something of that ruthless heroism which becomes so necessary when 
the country is in danger.<br><br>
But this very question of the ‘governing class’ raises questions 
which need very careful consideration. In the France of 1939 
the members of the upper middle class were never sick of 
declaring that they had lost all power. This was an exaggeration. 
Solidly supported by the banks and the Press, the régime of the 
<i>élite</i> was not, to that extent, ‘finished’. But it is true that the 
great industrialists no longer held a monopoly in the running of 
the country. The leaders of the principal trade unions, and, to a 
smaller extent, the mass of the wage-earners, had risen to a 
position of power in the affairs of the Republic. That had been 
<b>135</b> obvious in 1938, when a certain minister—a ‘Man of Munich’ if 
ever there was one—used them as intermediaries when he set 
about spreading an atmosphere of panic in order to cover up his 
own weakness. There can be no denying that if much heavy 
responsibility in this war rested on the shoulders of the military 
authorities, a considerable amount of blame must also be laid at 
the door of the trade unions.<br><br>
I am about to speak of matters of which I have no first-hand 
knowledge. I need hardly stress the fact that the life of the 
factory, both before and during the period of hostilities, lay far 
outside my normal field of operations. But the evidence which 
I have amassed is so unanimous, and comes from so many 
different sources, ranging in variety from chief engineers to 
machine-minders, that I am forced to accept its conclusions as 
valid. The output of our war factories was insufficient. We 
were not turning out enough aeroplanes, engines, or tanks. I 
do not for a moment believe that it was only, or even principally, 
the wage-earners who were to blame for this state of affairs. On 
the other hand, it would ill become them to plead complete 
innocence. Forgetful of the fact that they too, in their own way, 
were just as much soldiers as the men in uniform, they thought 
first and foremost about selling their labour at the highest price: 
in other words, about doing as little as possible, for the shortest 
time possible, in return for as much money as possible. In 
normal times that would be a perfectly natural attitude. ‘Sordid 
materialism!’ once exclaimed a certain politician whose own 
enthusiasm for the spiritual was not, I should have said, 
particularly obvious. But that, of course, is sheer nonsense. The 
manual worker is out to sell the strength of his arms. The men 
who sell textiles, sugar, or armaments are scarcely in a position 
to be shocked if he applies to his own case the great law of trade, 
which is to give little and to receive much. But however 
legitimate that point of view may be at other times, it is cruelly out of 
place when the very existence of one’s country is at stake, and 
<b>136</b> when those at the front are risking their lives. The plumber of 
the village where I live told me that when he was called up to 
work in a war factory the other men used to hide his tools to 
prevent him from turning out more, or working more quickly, 
than was permitted by the unwritten ‘law’ of the shop. That is 
an undeniable fact, and it provides a terrible indictment. But to 
suppose for a moment that that kind of indifference to the interests 
of the nation was general in one whole class of the population 
would be the height of injustice. I am more than ready to admit 
that there were honourable exceptions. Still, this attitude was 
quite widely enough spread for its consequences to weigh 
heavily in the scales of war. How it arose at all needs to be 
explained. <br><br>
It has been said again and again, and by all sorts of people, 
that this war failed to rouse the deepest feelings of the nation to 
a much larger extent than did the last one. I believe that view to 
be entirely wrong. Our people are temperamentally disinclined 
actively to want any war. No Frenchman in 1939 burned with the 
desire to ‘die for Danzig’. But then it is equally true to say that 
in 1914 none of them was particularly anxious to ‘die for 
Belgrade’. The camarilla which hatched its plots around the Serbian 
throne was no more familiar to our workers and peasants than 
was, twenty years later, the corrupt government of Polish 
colonels; nor if it had been would it have fanned them to a white 
heat of enthusiasm. As to Alsace-Lorraine, though it is, no doubt, 
true that when the actual fighting began in 1914, a picture of the 
martyred provinces did suddenly emerge in men’s minds from 
that decent obscurity which, only a few days earlier, had still 
shrouded it, but that was merely under the pressure of a 
necessity which, for quite other reasons, had already been accepted 
by the nation. Since we had been forced to take up arms, it 
was difficult to imagine that we should lay them down before 
we had delivered our lost brothers. Certainly, the beautiful 
Alsatian eyes, which the popular prints of the time were so fond 
<b>137</b> of depicting, would never, of themselves, have had sufficient 
influence, in peace-time, on a public opinion which was 
concerned only to maintain the security of the nation’s homes; 
would never have persuaded men lightly to launch their country 
on an adventure bristling with the most appalling dangers, with 
the sole object of drying those bewitching tears.<br><br>
The truth of the matter is that on both occasions the national 
response drew its vigour from the same source. ‘<i>They’re</i> always 
picking a quarrel with the rest of the world. The more we give 
‘em, the more they’ll want. It just can’t go on like this.’ That 
was what one of my neighbours in a little village of the Creuse 
said to me shortly before I left for Strasbourg. A peasant of 
1914 would have expressed himself in much the same words. As 
a matter of fact, if either of the two wars was more likely than 
the other to appeal to the deepest instincts of the masses, and 
especially of the industrial masses, it was undoubtedly the second, 
and that because of the very ‘ideological’ complexion which so 
many have blamed, but which did succeed in giving a touch of 
beauty to the sacrifices entailed. The men of the factories and 
the fields would no more, in 1939, have <i>deliberately</i> shed their 
blood for the overthrow of the dictators than would their elders 
of 1914 for the liberation of Alsace-Lorraine. But once the battle 
had been joined against those same dictators, and as a result of 
their action, they felt that by fighting they were helping forward 
one of the great tasks of humanity. To believe otherwise is to 
show complete ignorance of the high nobility which lies 
unexpressed in the hearts of a people which, like ours, has behind 
it a long history of political action. The absurd ineptitude of our 
official propaganda, its irritating and crude optimism, its timidity, 
and, above all, the inability of our rulers to give a frank 
definition of their war aims, may well, during the long months of 
inaction, have muddied to some extent what, in the early days, 
had been so crystal-clear. In May 1940 the spirit that had animated 
the men when they were first mobilized was not yet dead. Those 
<b>138</b> for whom the <i>Marseillaise</i> was still a rallying-song had not 
ceased to link it with the cult of patriotism and the hatred of 
tyrants.<br><br>
The trouble was that among the wage-earners these instincts, 
which were still strong, and which a less pusillanimous 
government would have known how to encourage, were at variance 
with certain other, and more recent, tendencies which were at 
work within the collective mind. I, with most of the men of my 
generation, had built enormous hopes, when we were young, on 
the trade-union movement. But we made no allowance for the 
narrowness of outlook which, little by little, choked the 
enthusiasm of the early, epic struggles. What was the cause of this 
failure? Partly, no doubt, an inevitable preoccupation with wage- 
claims, and a consequent scaling-down of interest and policy; 
partly, too, the fact that Labour’s leaders allowed themselves to 
get tangled up in the old political game of electoral propaganda 
and lobbying. However that may be, it is true to say that the 
trade-union movement has shown a growing tendency 
everywhere to diverge from the road on which its feet were originally 
set, as though dogged by some ineluctable Fate. <br><br>
Everyone knows that word <i>kleinbürgerlich</i> with which Marx 
stigmatized all politico-social movements which confined 
themselves to the narrow field of partial interests. Could anything have 
been more <i>kleinbürgerlich</i>, more <i>petit bourgeois</i>, than the attitude 
adopted in the last few years, and even during the war, by most 
of the big unions, and especially by those which included civil 
servants in their ranks? I have attended not a few meetings of 
my own professional organization. Its members were drawn 
from the intellectual class, but it is true to say that scarcely ever 
did they show real concern for anything except—not money on 
a large scale, but what I may call the small change of 
remuneration. They seemed to be blissfully unaware of such problems 
as the rôle which our corporation might play in the life of the 
country; nor were they ever prepared to discuss the bigger 
<b>139</b> question of France’s material future. Their vision was limited 
to immediate issues of petty profit, and I am afraid that this 
blindness marked the conduct of most of the big unions. I saw 
something of the way in which the Post Office workers and the 
railwaymen behaved both during and after the war, and the 
spectacle was not a very edifying one. Most of them, I am sure, 
were very decent fellows; a few, as events showed, could on 
occasion conduct themselves like heroes. But is it by any means 
certain that the rank and file, and, what is more important, their 
representatives, ever really understood that the days through 
which we were living called for more than parish-pump politics? 
Did they, I mean, fully realize what was demanded of them in 
pursuance of their daily work? That, after all, is the touchstone 
of the professional conscience. In most of the cities of western 
France during the month of June I saw hordes of wretched men 
wandering about the streets in an effort to get back to their 
homes. All of them were carrying loads far heavier than they 
could cope with, and why? Simply because the railway stations 
had seen fit to close their left-luggage offices for fear of imposing 
on their staffs a few hours of overtime, or of rather heavier work 
than usual. It was this kind of short-sightedness, this kind 
of administrative bumbledom, the effect of petty rivalry and a 
refusal to get the last ounce out of their members—so different 
from the dynamic energy of a Pelloutier1—which explains the 
nervelessness of the trade-union movement all over Europe, and 
not least in France, when confronted by the first aggressive 
moves of the dictator states. It accounts for their war record. 
What did a few noisy ‘resolutions’, aimed at the gallery, matter? 
The point is that the general run of organized labour never got 
it into their heads that the only thing that counted was as 
complete and as rapid a victory as possible for their country, and the 
defeat, not only of Nazism, but of all those elements of its 
philo-<b>140</b>sophy which its imitators, in the event of success, would 
inevitably borrow. They had not been taught, as they should have 
been by leaders worthy of the name, to look above, beyond, and 
around the petty problems of every day. By concentrating 
attention on matters concerned with the earning of their daily 
bread, they ran the risk of discovering that there might be no 
daily bread to earn. And now the hour of doom has sounded. 
Seldom has short-sightedness been more harshly punished.<br><br>
Then, too, there was the ideology of international pacifism. 
I flatter myself that I am a good citizen of the world, and among 
the least chauvinistic of men. As an historian, I know that there 
is a good deal of truth in Karl Marx’s slogan of ‘Workers of the 
World Unite!’ I have seen too much of war not to know that it 
is both horrible and senseless. But the narrowness of outlook 
which I have just been denouncing consists precisely in a refusal 
to bring these sentiments into harmonious relation with other 
forms of enthusiasm which are no less worthy of respect. I have 
never believed that because a man loves his country he cannot 
•also love his children, nor can I see why any form of 
internationalism, whether of the intellect or of class interests, should 
be irreconcilable with patriotism. I go farther, and say, after 
carefully searching my own conscience, that this presumed 
antinomy has no real existence at all. It is a poor heart that cannot 
find room for more than one kind of affection.<br><br>
But let us not linger in this world of the emotions. Those of 
us who have a certain degree of self-respect, who hate big words 
which have become so popularly debased that they no longer 
express the intimate truths of mind and heart, find it difficult to 
breathe its atmosphere for long without a sensation of nausea. 
Besides, that particular world is one into which the pacifists did 
not^s a rule ask us to follow them. What they primarily invoked 
was the sentiment of self-interest; and it was because they made 
of this presumed self-interest an image woefully at variance with 
any true knowledge of their fellow men, that they overweighted 
<b>141</b> with error the minds of the somewhat sheep-like disciples who 
trusted them. They said that French capitalism was a hard 
taskmaster; and in that they were certainly not wrong. But what 
they forgot was that victory for the authoritarian régimes would 
be bound to lead to the complete enslavement of the workers. 
Were they really blind to the fact that the profiteers-to-be of our 
defeat were already on the prowl ready to seize upon it—nay, 
actually hoping that it would occur? They taught, not without 
reason, that war builds up a mass of useless destruction. But they 
omitted to distinguish between a war which men have deliberately 
planned, and a war imposed from without; between murder and 
legitimate self-defence. To those who asked them whether they 
did not think it was one’s duty to wring the neck of the 
executioner, they replied: ‘No one’s attacking us’—for they loved to 
play with words. Maybe, having lost the habit of looking their 
own thoughts fairly and squarely in the face, they had allowed 
themselves to be caught in the tangle of their own equivocations. 
The highwayman does not say to his victim, ‘It’s your blood 
I’m after’; he offers him a choice—’Your money or your life’. 
Similarly, when an aggressor nation sets out to oppress its 
neighbours it says: ‘Either abdicate your liberty or take the 
consequence of massacre.’ They maintained that war is the 
concern of the rich and powerful, that the poor should have 
nothing to do with it. As though, in an old society, cemented 
by centuries of a shared culture, the humble are not always, for 
good or ill, constrained to make common cause with the mighty. 
They whispered—I have heard them—that Hitler was not nearly 
so black as he was painted; that the nation would save itself a 
great deal of suffering by opening its gates to the enemy, instead 
of setting itself to oppose invasion by force of arms. How, I 
wonder, do these noble apostles feel to-day in that occupied zone 
which lies in starvation beneath the jack-boot of tyranny? <br><br>
Since the gospel they preached was one of seeming 
convenience, their sermons found an easy echo in those lazy, selfish 
<b>142</b> instincts which exist in all men’s hearts side by side with nobler 
potentialities. These enthusiasts, many of whom were not, as 
individuals, lacking in courage, worked unconsciously to 
produce a race of cowards. For it is an undoubted truth that unless 
virtue is accompanied by severe self-criticism, it always runs the 
risk of turning against its own most dearly held convictions. 
Dear fellow teachers—when it came to the point, you did, for 
the most part, put up a magnificent fight. It was your goodwill 
which managed to create in many a sleepy secondary school, in 
many a tradition-ridden university, the only form of education 
of which, perhaps, we can feel genuinely proud. I only hope that 
a day will come, and come soon, a day of glory and of happiness 
for France, when, liberated from the enemy, and freer than ever 
in our intellectual life, we may meet again for the mutual 
discussion of ideas. And when that happens, do you not think that, 
having learned from an experience so dearly purchased, you will 
find much to alter in the things you were teaching only a few 
years back?<br><br>
But what is really remarkable is that these extremist lovers of 
the human race showed no surprise at all when, on the road that 
led to capitulation, they found themselves walking arm in arm 
with the born enemies of their class, the sworn foes of their 
ideals. As a matter of fact, odd though such an alliance may 
seem, its intellectual basis is to be found in conditions long 
antecedent to a supervening political hostility. Among those 
with whom they had more than once crossed swords on the 
battlefield of the hustings, with whom now they were prepared 
to collaborate in the work of securing peace at any price, were 
many who had the same social background as themselves, though 
they had taken early flight to richer feeding-grounds. These 
turncoats had long hidden away all that might remind people of 
their earlier enthusiasm for revolution. Old clothes of just that 
cut, they thought, might prove a shade embarrassing in the 
circumstances of their new lives. But, in their onward march, 
<b>143</b> they had passed through many political parties, and something 
of what they had found there had remained indelibly impressed 
upon them. They had lost all sense of national values, and were 
quite incapable of finding them again. It is no accident that the 
collapse of our country brought to power a minister who was 
once at Kienthal,[1] nor will it be one if the Germans, wishing to 
elevate to a position of influence some gutter-agitator, should 
pick on a man who, before assuming in the years before the 
war a wash of sham patriotism, had been a Communist leader. 
Against one particular school of politics no more terrible charge 
can be brought than this: that once a man has been formed by it, 
he may forget everything it taught him, including much that was 
fine, much that was noble, save only this—the denial of his 
country. <br><br>
Thus it came about that though the general needs of our 
national defence were more inextricably than ever bound up with 
the interests of the wage-earners, they made demands upon the 
working class which, however legitimately obvious they may 
have been, were compromised by a spirit of uncertainty and 
gloom in the factories. This vague lack of purpose was bad 
enough: it was made far worse by the incredible contradictions 
of French Communism. <br><br>
But here I find myself coming to grips with an entirely different 
order of problems which belong, strictly, to the world of thought. 
It was not only in the field that intellectual causes lay at the 
root of our defeat. As a nation we had been content with 
incomplete knowledge and imperfectly thought-out ideas. Such 
an attitude is not a good preparation for military success. Our 
system of government demands the participation of the masses. 
The destiny of the People is in their own hands, and I see no 
<b>144</b> reason for believing that they are not perfectly capable of 
choosing rightly. But what effort had been made to supply them with 
that minimum of clear and definite information without which 
“to rational conduct is possible? To that question the answer is 
‘None’. In no way did our so-called democratic system so 
signally fail. That particular dereliction of duty constituted the 
most heinous crime of our self-styled democrats. The matter 
would be less serious if what we had to deplore were merely the 
lies and half-truths inspired by party loyalties openly avowed. 
Wicked these may be, but, on the whole, they can be fairly 
easily discounted. Far graver is the fact that our national Press, 
claiming to provide an impartial news-service, was sailing under 
false colours. Many newspapers, even those which openly wore 
the livery of party beliefs, were secretly enslaved to unavowed 
and, often, squalid interests. Some of them were controlled by 
foreign influences. I do not deny that the common sense of 
the ordinary reader did, to some extent, counterbalance this, but 
only at the cost of developing an attitude of scepticism to all 
propaganda, printed and broadcast alike. It would be a great 
mistake to think that the elector always votes as ‘his’ paper tells 
him to. I have known more than one humble citizen who votes 
almost automatically <i>against</i> the views expressed by his chosen 
rag, and it may be that this refusal to be stampeded by printed 
insincerities is among the more consoling elements of our 
contemporary national life. It does, at least, offer some hope for 
the future. Still, it must be admitted that such an attitude 
provides a poor intellectual training for those who are called upon to 
understand what is at stake in a vast world struggle, to judge 
rightly of the coming storm, and to arm themselves adequately 
against its violence. Quite deliberately—as one can see by 
reading <i>Mein Kampf</i> or the records of Rauschning’s conversations— 
Hitler kept the truth from his servile masses. Instead of 
intellectual persuasion he gave them emotional suggestion. For us 
there is but one set of alternatives. Either, like the Germans, we 
<b>145</b> must turn our people into a keyboard on which a few leaders can 
play at will (but who are those leaders? The playing of those at 
present on the stage is curiously lacking in resonance); or we 
can so train them that they may be able to collaborate to the full 
with the representatives in whose hands they have placed the 
reins of government. At the present stage of civilization this 
dilemma admits of no middle term. . . . The masses no longer 
obey. They <i>follow</i>, either because they have been hypnotized or 
because they <i>know</i>. <br><br>
Is it true to say that our comfortable and relatively educated 
classes thought it wiser—from motives of contempt or mistrust 
—<i>not</i> to keep the man in the street, or in the fields, accurately 
informed? That some such feeling did exist there can be small 
doubt. It was traditional. The European <i>bourgeoisie</i> had never 
been really happy about letting the ‘lower classes’ learn to read. 
An historian could quote many texts bearing on this point. But 
the evil had gone much deeper. Even those who were in a 
position to satisfy their curiosity lacked the desire to do so. Compare 
two newspapers which carry almost precisely the same title: 
<i>The Times</i> and <i>Le Temps</i>. Both are controlled by roughly 
similar interests; both appeal to a public which is far removed 
from the level of the herd; the impartiality of both is equally 
suspect. Still, allowing for all that, the reader of the first will be 
infinitely better informed about the world as it is than the regular 
subscriber to the second. The same contrast is to be found if one 
compares those organs of the French Press which take most pride 
in what they call their ‘good manners’, with, say, the <i>Frankfurter 
Zeitung</i>—not only with the <i>Frankfurter</i> of pre-Hitlerian days, 
but even with its modern successor. The wise man, says the 
proverb, is contented with little. In the field of information, our 
middle class-has certainly been, in the sense intended by the sober 
Epicurus, terribly wise. <br><br>
This symptom is confirmed by a hundred others. In the course 
of two wars I rubbed shoulders with a large number of officers, 
<b>146</b> regulars and reservists alike, who varied very considerably in 
their social origins. Among those who did even a little reading 
(and they were pretty thin on the ground) I scarcely ever saw 
one with a book in his hands which might have helped him to a 
better understanding of the present by shedding on it the light 
of the past. The only copy at ‘Q’ of Strasser’s book on Hitler 
was brought there by me. Only one of my colleagues ever asked 
to borrow it. The poverty of our municipal libraries has often 
been made a matter of scandal. Look at the public balance-sheet 
of any of our city administrations, and you will admit that 
‘indigence’ is the better word. About i November 1918—long 
before Germany had started burning books—I had occasion to 
visit, at Vouziers, a ‘field library’ which had been abandoned by 
the retreating enemy. Its contents were far from being confined 
to thrillers or political tracts. Have <i>we</i> ever tried to provide 
our troops with anything comparable? It is not only to the art 
of knowing others that we have allowed ourselves to become 
strangers. What have we done about the old maxim which says 
‘Know thyself? I have been told that on one of the International 
Commissions our delegate was publicly laughed at by his Polish 
colleague because, of all the nations represented, we alone were 
unable to provide a serious statistical table of wage-rates. The 
heads of our great industrial undertakings have always pinned 
their faith to secrecy—which favours the petty interests of 
individual—rather than to that knowledge openly displayed 
which assists collective action. In this century of chemists they 
have retained the mental outlook of alchemists. Study, for a 
moment, the behaviour of those groups whose self-imposed task 
it formerly was to combat the spread of Communism. It should 
have been obvious that only an honest inquiry, intelligently 
conducted, up and down the country, stood any chance of 
providing reliable information about the causes of a success 
which was giving them such a headache, and of doing something, 
perhaps, to arrest its progress. But none of the individuals 
con-<b>147</b>cerned ever thought of such a thing. The political motive which 
lay behind this particular activity is not, here, my concern. The 
point I want to make is that, whether one be sympathetic or 
hostile to what was proposed, the intellectual efficiency of this 
powerful association of interests was hopelessly inadequate. Is 
it to be wondered at that our military staffs organized their 
Intelligence Services so badly? Their members belonged to a 
social class in which the taste for self-education was suffering 
from creeping paralysis. They were the kind of men who could 
read <i>Mein Kampf</i> and still entertain doubts about the true 
intentions of the Nazi policy. Because they have little ‘realistic’ 
curiosity, and are proud of it, they would seem to doubt them 
even to-day. <br><br>
But the worst of this mental laziness is that, almost inevitably, 
it leads to a sort of gloomy mood of self-satisfaction. Every day 
I hear ‘back to the land’ sermons on the radio. The French 
people, maimed and abandoned, are told: ‘You let yourselves 
be deluded by the charms of a far too highly mechanized 
civilization. By accepting its laws and its products, you turned 
away from those ancient values which made you what you are. 
You had become chaff of the great city, of the factory, perhaps, 
even, of the school, whereas what your nature craves is the village 
or the market-town familiar to your ancestors, the primitive 
farming methods of ancient days, the small, compact society 
governed by its local notables. Those are the waters in which 
you must bathe if you are to recover your former greatness.’ I 
am well aware that under these fine words there lay concealed— 
and not so very successfully concealed either—interests which 
have nothing whatever to do with the happiness and prosperity 
of France. A great many people who sit in the driver’s seat 
today—or think they do—have never ceased to regret the docility 
which they believe to be inherent in all mildly successful peasant 
societies (not that they are right. Our country folk have always 
had what the old chroniclers call <i>la nuque dure</i>—have always, in 
<b>148</b> other words, been ‘pretty tough’). But it is chiefly Germany, 
now that she has triumphed by the machine, who wants to hold 
the monopoly of machine methods. She wants to surround 
herself with humble vassal nations, and these have got to be purely 
agricultural societies which can be compelled, in the years to 
come, to exchange, at prices fixed by the conqueror, their corn 
and their dairy produce for the output of her heavy industries. 
The voice on the fadio may speak our language, but it comes from 
the other side of the Rhine. These bucolic recommendations are, 
however, nothing new. They were made familiar to us, in the 
years before the war, through a whole literature of renunciation. 
It was for ever, this literature, lashing what it called 
‘Americanization’. It denounced the dangers of the machine and of material 
progress. It contrasted these things, to their disadvantage, with 
the quiet pleasures of the country-side, with the grace of a 
civilization dominated by the small market-town, with the charm, 
as well as with the hidden strength, of a society which it called 
upon to remain increasingly loyal to the ways of life of a vanished 
age. The theme was purely academic, or, it would be truer to 
say, childish. Our older authors of the country-side, men like 
Noël du Fail and Olivier de Serres, would have laughed it out of 
court. There is more of endurance than of charm about genuine 
rural labour, and it is only in the <i>Eclogues</i> that the village appears 
as an abode of peace. Not that there was not a certain amount of 
truth in the glorification of country ways. I am convinced that 
even to-day a people can gain much from having its life rooted 
in the soil, for only thus will it give to its economic development 
a solidity which is rare in the modern world, and ensure the 
existence of those reserves of human vitality which nothing else 
can replace. From having seen at first hand how he lives, from 
having once fought at his side, and from having much pondered 
the details of his history, I know the true worth of the French 
peasant, the vigour and the unwearied quickness of his mind. I 
can feel as vividly as anybody else the modest charm of our old 
<b>149</b>market-towns, and I am well aware that they served as the mould 
in which, through long ages, was formed all that is most active 
in the French character. <br><br>
But are we prepared to be what the Italians have declared that 
they will never consent to be, a mere ‘historical museum’? It is 
no use pretending: the choice is not really open to us. Even if 
it were, we know only too well the fate reserved by our enemies 
for museums. We want to live, and if we are to live we must 
emerge from this struggle victorious. Let us at least have the 
courage to admit that what so far has been conquered in our land 
is precisely the life of our dear, dead towns. The leisurely 
rhythm of their days, their crawling motor-buses, their sleepy 
officials, the time lost in their soft atmosphere of lethargy, the 
lazy ease of their café-life, their local politics and petty trades, 
their empty libraries, their taste for the past, and their mistrust 
of anything that may shake them out of their comfortable habits. 
These are the things that have succumbed before the hellish 
onset of that ‘dynamic’ Germany whose aggression was backed 
by the resources of a national life organized on the principle of 
the hive. If only to preserve what can, and ought to, be of value 
in our great heritage, we must adapt ourselves to the claims of 
a new age. The donkey-cart may be a friendly and a charming 
means of transport, but if we refuse to replace it by the 
motorcar, where the motor-car is desirable, we shall find ourselves 
stripped of everything—including the donkey. But if we are to 
set about building the new, we must first acquire the necessary 
knowledge. If our officers failed to master the methods of 
warfare imposed upon them by the contemporary world, that was 
largely because, in the contemporary world, our middle classes, 
from which they were drawn, had been willing to keep their eyes 
lazily shut to the facts. If we turn back on ourselves we shall be 
lost. Salvation can be ours only on condition that we set our 
brains to work with a will, in order that we may <i>know</i> more fully, 
and get our imaginations moving to a quicker tempo.<br><br>
<b>150</b> We must, too, recover that coherence of thought of which, in 
recent years, a strange sickness seems to have deprived all those 
in France who have been active in politics, whether on a large 
or a small scale. No historian is likely to feel much surprise that 
the ‘Right-Wing’ parties should have been so over-prompt to 
acknowledge our national defeat. Throughout the whole course 
of our history that has been their consistent tradition, from 
the days of the Bourbon Restoration to those of the Versailles 
Assembly. Certainly, the confused issues of the Dreyfus affair 
did seem, for a moment, to have complicated matters by 
identifying patriotism with militarism. It is only natural that the deepest 
instincts of these men of the Right should once again have come 
out on top, and, on the whole, it is better that they should. But 
that the same men should, turn and turn about, have manifested 
the most fanatical anti-Germanism and a willingness to enter the 
continental system of Germany in the guise of vassals, that they 
should have defended Poincaré’s diplomacy, yet damned the so- 
called ‘war-mongering’ of their political opponents, does call 
for thought. We can only assume that those of their leaders 
who were impelled by honest motives suffered from an almost 
incredible intellectual instability, and that among their faithful 
followers there was a no less shocking blindness to the 
antinomies of reason. I am perfectly well aware that the Germany 
of Hitler roused sympathies to which the Germany of Ebert 
could never have hoped to appeal, but that does not alter the 
fact that France has, fundamentally, remained the same. Those 
who seek, at any cost, to explain away such mental acrobatics 
could not, probably, do better than point out that the views held 
by those at the other end of the political scale were no less 
illogical. To refuse military credits, and then, twenty-four hours 
later, to call for ‘guns for Spain’; to preach anti-patriotism, and 
then, in twelve months’ time, to demand the formation of a 
‘French Front’; to shirk the obligations of military service, and 
to invite the masses to do the same—these inelegant zigzags mark 
<b>151</b> only too clearly the curve traced before our wondering eyes by 
those who danced upon the tight-rope of Communism. I know 
perfectly well that beyond our frontier a brown-haired Homo 
<i>alpinus</i> of middle height, with a little red-headed cripple as his 
chief spokesman, managed to found a despotism on the myth of 
the Tall, Fair, Aryan Superman. But we French have always 
enjoyed the reputation—in the past, at least—of being solid, 
sensible, and logical. It does really seem that if ever our people 
are to be subjected to what Renan, after an earlier defeat, called 
an ‘intellectual and moral reform’, the first thing they will have 
to learn is that old axiom of classical logic—<i>A</i> is <i>A</i>: <i>B</i> is <i>B</i>: 
<i>A</i> is not <i>B</i>. <br><br>
Naturally, much inquiry is necessary into, and a great deal can 
be said about, the underlying causes of these weaknesses. Our 
middle class, which, in spite of everything, remains the brain of 
the nation, was a great deal more addicted to serious studies when 
most of its members had independent means than it is to-day. 
The business man, the doctor, the lawyer, has to put in a hard 
day’s work at his office. When he leaves it he is in no fit state, 
it would seem, for anything but amusement. Perhaps a better 
organization of the working day might, without diminishing the 
intensity of his labours, assure him a rather greater degree of 
leisure. But how about these amusements of his? Do they take 
an intellectual form? One thing is certain: they rarely have any 
connexion, even indirect, with his active life. For it is an ancient 
tradition among us, that intelligence should be enjoyed, like art, 
for its own sake, and should be kept carefully shut away from all 
possibility of practical application. We are a nation of great 
scientists, yet no technicians are less scientific than ours. We 
read, when we do read, with the object of acquiring culture. I 
have nothing against that. But it never seems to occur to us that 
culture can, and should, be a great help to us in our daily lives. <br><br>
But what the French people really need is to be pupils once 
again in the school of true intellectual freedom. ‘It is good that 
<b>152</b> heretics should exist/ Our military men were not alone in having 
lost sight of this wise maxim. About traditionalist opinion I wijl, 
for the moment, say nothing. It is as it is. But what are wef to 
think of those who like to call themselves ‘advanced’? I have a 
very great admiration for the works of Karl Marx. As a man he 
was, I fear, quite intolerable, and his philosophy is certainly a 
good deal less original than some people like to think. But never 
was there a more powerful analyst of the social problem. If ever 
those among our historians who are initiates of the newest cult 
of Social Science decide to set up a portrait gallery of their 
ancestors, the bearded bust of the old Rhineland prophet will 
take a foremost place in the chapel of their corporation. But is 
that any reason for establishing his teaching as the touchstone of 
all knowledge? There are admirable men of science who, though 
in the laboratory they believe in nothing but experimental 
research, will gaily write treatises on ‘Marxist’ physiology or 
chapters on ‘Marxist’ physics. What right have they, with those 
achievements to their credit, to point the finger of scorn at 
Hitlerian mathematics? Schools that formerly preached the 
doctrine of the mutability of economic forms have been known 
to excommunicate such ill-advised scholars as refuse to swear 
on the Gospel of the Master. As though theories born of the 
observation of European societies as they existed in the sixties of 
last century, and fed on such sociological knowledge as a scholar 
of that time possessed, could or should be regarded as Holy 
Writ in the year 1940! <br><br>
Condorcet, a man impregnated with the powerful rationalism 
of the eighteenth century, showed a greater wisdom when, in his 
famous report on <i>Public Education</i>, he said: ‘No class of our 
citizens should ever be led to regard either the French 
Constitution or even the Declaration of Rights as Tables of the Law sent 
down from Heaven, and to be treated only with adoration and 
unquestioning belief.’<br><br>
I do not need anyone to whisper in my ear that the leaders of 
<b>153</b> these various sects have been secretly far less faithful to their 
different orthodoxies than their acts and their public declarations 
might lead one to expect. I know all about that. But it does not 
alter the fact, does it, that in their horrible conclaves those very 
intellectual vices were much in evidence which have done us so 
much harm? To these was added a taste for certain ambiguities 
of expression, and a quite insufficient awareness of the truth that 
the world is always in a state of flux. In this matter of the men 
of the Left, as of the General Staff—for it often happens in the 
history of a nation that the bitterest adversaries breathe, 
unconsciously, the same intellectual atmosphere—Hitler was right. 
There is no getting away from it. Not the Hitler of the full-dress 
demagogic speeches, but the Hitler who once said to Rauschning 
when discussing this very question of Marxism: ‘We, you and I, 
know that there isn’t any final stability, but only a perpetual state 
of evolution. The future is an inexhaustible river of infinite 
possibilities whose source is a creation which is always being 
renewed.’<br><br>
A university professor will be forgiven if he lays a great part 
of the responsibility for all this on education, and, himself an 
educator, does his best to expose, without undue beating about 
the bush, the defects of our teaching methods. <br><br>
Our system of secondary education has been continuously 
oscillating, for a long time past, between an old-fashioned 
humanism which, aesthetically at least, has strong claims on its 
loyalty, and a taste—often excessive—for the new. But it is 
neither capable of preserving the aesthetic and moral standards of 
classical culture, nor of creating fresh ones to take their place. 
Consequently it has done little to develop the intellectual vitality 
of the nation. It lays upon its pupils the dead weight of 
examinations, and in this respect the universities are no better. It makes 
little room in its curriculum for those sciences which depend 
upon observation and might play so large a part in the training 
of visual concentration and the use of the grey matter of the 
<b>154</b> brain. It pays a great deal of attention to the physiology of 
plants—and quite rightly, but it almost entirely neglects field 
botany, and, in so doing, commits a grievous fault. In English 
schools the authorities make a great point of encouraging 
‘hobbies’ (natural history, fossil-collecting, photography, and 
all sorts of odd pastimes). Our own pastors and masters, on the 
contrary, modestly avert their eyes from every kind of ‘queer 
taste’ or else leave such matters to the tender mercy of the Boy 
Scouts. Indeed, the success of the Scout movement probably 
shows more clearly than does anything else where the most 
yawning gaps are to be found in our national system of 
education. I know more than one boy who was an excellent performer 
in the classroom but never once so much as opened a serious book 
after he had left his secondary school. On the other hand, it is 
no rare thing to find that those who had the reputation with their 
masters of being dunces or near-dunces have since developed a 
real taste for the things of the mind. If such occurrences were 
occasional only, they would not be particularly significant. It 
is when they become multiplied that one begins uncomfortably 
to feel that ‘something is wrong’. <br><br>
Am I moved to say all this by the same sort of perversity that 
urges a lover to hurt the beloved? As an historian I am naturally 
inclined to be especially hard on the teaching of history. It is not 
only the Staff College that equips its pupils inadequately to face 
the test of action. I do not mean that the secondary schools can 
be accused with justice of neglecting the contemporary scene. 
On the contrary, they tend to give it an increasingly dominant 
place in the curriculum. But just because our teachers of history 
are inclined to focus their attention <i>only</i> on the present, or at most 
on the very recent past, they find the present more and more 
difficult to explain. They are like oceanographers who refuse to 
look up at the stars because they are too remote from the sea, and 
consequently are unable to discover the causes of the tides. I 
do not say that the past entirely governs the present, but I do 
<b>155</b> maintain that we shall never satisfactorily understand the present 
unless we take the past into account. But there is still worse to 
come. Because our system of historical teaching deliberately cuts 
itself off from a wide field of vision and comparison, it can no 
longer impart to those whose minds it claims to form anything 
like a true sense of difference and change. Let me give an example 
of what I mean. <br><br>
The policy which we pursued in the Rhineland after 1918 was 
based upon the picture of a Europe which no longer existed. It 
continued to treat as a living issue what was really a dead horse— 
German Separatism. Or again: our diplomats obstinately pinned 
their faith to the Hapsburgs—those faded ghosts fit only to 
adorn the ‘keepsake’ volumes on the tables of right-thinking 
conservatives. They were far more afraid of the Hohenzollerns 
than of Hitler. Any genuine theory of history would long ago 
have permitted those particular dead to bury their dead. 
Furthermore, those who drew up our school curricula had, almost all 
of them, a marked affection for all <i>recent</i> manifestation of national 
life, no matter how superficial, simply because they <i>were</i> recent, 
and easy to grasp. Consequently, they were obsessed by politics. 
They recoiled with a sense of outraged modesty from any 
suggestion of sociological analysis, and therefore failed to develop 
a taste for it in their pupils. No doubt some will say that I am 
expecting too much of boys who had only just reached 
matriculation standard. Against any such criticism I most vehemently 
protest. I do not believe that it is any more difficult to interest 
the young in the complexities of a technical problem or in the 
apparent oddities of a civilization which happens to be remote 
either in time or space, than it is to keep their minds fixed on the 
acts of politicians or the changes of governments. A text-book 
which sets out to explain how the July Monarchy substituted 
‘life peerages’ for ‘hereditary titles’ is not, I suggest, a very useful 
work to put in the hands of junior students. They have more 
important things than that to learn, things more closely concerned 
<b>156</b> with human values, better calculated to mould the malleable 
imagination of youth, and more instructive for the future 
citizens of France and of the world. What we need is that the 
windows should be thrown wide open and the atmosphere of 
our classrooms thoroughly aired. That will be the task of the 
rising generation. If we are to see a sounder intellectual 
training in the country at large, and a more efficient spirit in our 
military commanders, we must rely far more upon the young 
than upon the five academies, the great university authorities, 
and the Staff College. <br><br><br><br>

Every conceivable sin is laid at the door of the political régime 
which governed France in the years before the war. I have only 
to look about me to feel convinced that the parliamentary system 
has too often favoured intrigue at the cost of intelligence and 
true loyalty. The men who govern us to-day were, for the most 
part, brought up in a land of mental bogs. If now they turn 
against the methods which made them what they are, that is only 
because they are sly old foxes who think the trick worth trying. 
The dishonest clerk who cracks the office safe is not likely to 
carry a bunch of skeleton keys about with him for all to see. He 
is far too frightened that someone cleverer than himself will 
pocket them and scoop the loot. <br><br>
When the time for real reform at last comes round, when we 
can once again demand that we be led into the light of day, and 
that the political sects which have lost the nation’s confidence 
be swept from the stage, we shall have to do better than set our 
feet in the tracks of the immediate past. The monstrously swollen 
assemblies which, in recent years, have claimed to rule us were 
one of the more absurd legacies of history. It mattered little that 
the States-General, convened to pronounce a simple ‘Yes’ or 
‘No’, should have a membership of hundreds. But a chamber 
whose function it is to run the country must become chaotic 
once it has allowed itself to degenerate into a mob. It is, indeed, 
<b>157</b> a question whether a chamber which was designed merely to 
sanction and control, <i>can</i> govern. Our party machinery had 
already begun to give off the smell of a dry-rot which it had 
acquired in small cafés and obscure back rooms. It could not 
even offer the excuse that it was strong, because at the first 
breath of despotism it collapsed like a house of cards. Imprisoned 
in doctrines which they knew to be outmoded, of programmes 
which they had long abandoned as signposts to practical politics, 
the great parries served as sham rallying-points for men who, on 
all the major problems of the moment—as was only too obvious 
after Munich—held utterly opposed views. They declared 
themselves to be at odds with others whose members thought, in fact, 
precisely as they did. More often than not they failed even to 
determine who was to wield the power. They served merely as 
spring-boards for clever careerists who spent their time 
knocking one another off the top of the political structure. <br><br>
It was entirely owing to our ministers and our assemblies that 
we were so ill prepared for war. Of that there can be not the 
slightest doubt. Not, it is true, that the High Command did 
much to help them. But nothing shed a cruder light on the 
spinelessness of Government than its capitulation to the 
technicians. In 1915 a succession of Parliamentary Commissions did 
more to provide us with heavy artillery than did all the 
artillerymen put together. Why did not their successors do more, and 
do it quicker, in the matter of aeroplanes and tanks? The history 
of the Ministry of Munitions reads like a lesson in unreason. It 
is incredible that we should have had to wait until the war was 
several months old before it was even set up, and then only as a 
makeshift organization. It should have been ready to start work, 
with a staff already picked and prepared, on the very day that 
mobilization was ordered. Only very exceptionally did 
Parliament ever refuse credits if the specialists demanded them with 
sufficient firmness, but it lacked the power to compel their proper 
use. It could, had it so wished, have put its hand in the elector’s 
<b>158</b> pocket, but it was afraid of irritating him. Its dislike of imposing 
on reservists the necessary period of field-training undermined 
the whole principle of the nation in arms. True, the routine of 
the barrack-square—not the best way of utilizing these periods 
of instruction—did at least set that particular ball rolling, but 
that is not saying much. More than once the leaders of the 
Government found themselves driven to ask for extraordinary 
powers—which was tantamount to admitting that the 
constitutional machinery was getting rusty. It would have been far 
better to redesign the machine while there was yet time. Those 
extraordinary powers were the line of least resistance, though 
nobody seems to have realized that they merely served to 
reinforce the existing practices of government and did nothing 
towards reforming them. Spoiled by a long familiarity with the 
lobbies, our political leaders imagined that they were gleaning 
information when all they were doing was to collect gossip from 
chance acquaintances. All problems, of the world as well as of 
the nation, appeared to them in the light of personal rivalries. <br><br>
That the system suffered from weaknesses there can be no 
denying; but it was not so inherently vicious as has sometimes 
been argued. Many of the crimes of which it has been accused 
were, I should say, purely imaginary. It is often said that party, 
and, in particular, anti-clerical, passions disorganized the armed 
forces. I can bear witness from my own experience that at 
Bohain General Blanchard went to Mass every Sunday. To 
assume that he had waited until war broke out to do so would be 
to level a gratuitous insult at his civic courage. It was right and 
proper that he, as a believer, should publicly perform his religious 
duties. The unbeliever who held such acts against him showed 
himself to be a fool or a boor. But I see no reason to maintain 
that those religious convictions, loyally adhered to, stood in the 
way of his being given an army by a succession of so-called Left- 
Wing governments, or of his leading it to defeat. <br><br>
Did those parliaments of ours, if it comes to that, or the 
<b>159</b> ministries born of them, ever really concentrate the government 
of the country in their own hands? Earlier systems had left a 
legacy of public corporations which the politicians never really 
succeeded in controlling. No doubt party considerations did 
to some extent weigh in the appointment of the heads of these 
bodies, and, as the winds of the moment blew, so did 
personalities change—not always with the happiest results. But, 
fundamentally, these great organizations were self-governing, and the 
men who formed their rank and file always remained, roughly, 
of the same type. The École des Sciences Politiques, for instance, 
was always the spiritual home of scions of rich and powerful 
families. Its graduates filled the embassies, the Treasury, the 
Council of State, and the Public Audit Office. The École 
Polytechnique, with its curious power of leaving an indelible 
and recognizable imprint on the young men who had passed 
through it, did far more than supply recruits for the general staffs 
of industry. It unlocked the door to a career in public 
engineering, where promotion had almost the automatic precision of a 
well-oiled machine. The universities, through the medium of 
a complex arrangement of councils and committees, filled any 
vacancies there might be in their teaching-staffs by a system of 
co-option which was not without its dangers when the need for 
new blood arose, and could offer to their successful students 
guarantees of permanent employment which the system at 
present in force has—provisionally, it is said—abolished. The 
Institute of France, entrenched in its wealth and in that prestige 
which the glitter of a title can always impose even on those who 
pass for being philosophically minded, still retains, for good or 
ill, the full dignity of its intellectual pre-eminence. If the Academy 
might occasionally be influenced in its elections by political 
considerations, it can scarcely be maintained that these have been 
of a Left-Wing kind. ‘I know of only three citadels of 
Conservatism/ said Paul Bourget on one occasion, ‘the House of 
Lords, the German General Staff, and the French Academy.’<br><br>
<b>160</b> Was the régime right or wrong in the consideration it habitually 
showed to these ancient corporations? The subject might be 
discussed endlessly. Some will uphold them in the interests of 
stability and in recognition of an honourable tradition. Others, 
with whom, I confess, my own sympathies lie, will argue against 
them on grounds of bureaucratic tendencies, routine mentality, 
and professional arrogance. But there are certainly two things 
for which a heavy responsibility lay at their door. <br><br>
They raised a clamorous outcry when a Popular Front 
Government, in an effort to break down the monopoly held by 
the École des Sciences Politiques, presumed to establish a School 
of Administration. Not that the project was a particularly good 
one. It would have been very much better to throw open an 
administrative career to all by means of a system of public 
scholarships, and to let candidates be prepared by the universities 
along those cultural lines which have served the English civil 
service so well. But, for all that, the underlying idea was sound. 
Whatever the complexion of its government, a country is bound 
to suffer if the <i>instruments</i> of power are hostile to the spirit which 
obtains in the various branches of its public institutions. A 
monarchy needs a personnel composed of monarchists. A 
democracy becomes hopelessly weak, and the general good suffers 
accordingly, if its higher officials, bred up to despise it, and 
necessarily drawn from those very classes the dominance of which 
it is pledged to destroy, serve it only half-heartedly. <br><br>
The other point which can justly be brought against them is 
this. The system of co-option which, whether officially or 
unofficially, was the rule in almost all the great public corporations, 
tended to give much too prominent a place to age. As in the 
Army, promotion—with very few exceptions—was, generally 
speaking, slow, and the old men at the top, even when they 
did show willingness to help their juniors up the ladder, were 
inclined to pick their men from among those who had shown 
themselves to be model pupils—almost excessively model. We 
<b>161</b> judge revolutions to be admirable or hateful according as their 
principles are or are not our own. All of them, however, have 
one supreme virtue which is inseparable from the vigour out of 
which they grow: they do thrust the young into positions of 
prominence. I detest Nazism, but, like the French Revolution, 
with which one should blush to compare it, it did put at the head, 
both of its armed forces and of its Government, men who, 
because their brains were fresh and had not been formed in 
the routine of the schools, were capable of understanding ‘the 
surprising and the new’. All we had to set against them was a 
set of bald-pates and youngish dotards. <br><br>
But however powerful the resistance offered by a 
Government’s machinery may be, the <i>system</i> is the creation of the society 
which is said to be governed by it. Sometimes the engine may 
run away with the driver, but, as a rule, it will give good service 
if it is properly handled. I find it difficult not to laugh when I 
hear certain business men of my acquaintance inveighing against 
the venality of the Press just after they have managed to get some 
article ‘planted’ (in return for good hard cash) on one of our 
more respectable dailies, or when they have commissioned a 
former minister to write a book which will bolster up their own 
petty interests, fulminating against ‘Parliamentary men of straw’! 
Who most deserves to be hanged, the corrupted or the corrupter? 
Our rich <i>bourgeois</i> like nothing better than to grumble at 
the teaching profession. In the days when they controlled the 
money-bags much more completely than they do to-day, they 
had it in their power to provide in the budget for a reasonable 
scale of pay for schoolmasters. What, in fact, they did was to 
give those who were entrusted with the education of their sons 
far less than they would have dreamed of giving to their servants. 
The reputation for avarice has done the French people an infinity 
of harm: and it is this provincial attitude of mind that has been 
responsible. <br><br>
But what, more than anything else, has injured our machinery 
<b>162</b> of State, and, literally, stopped it from working, is that major lack 
of understanding which lies like a blight over the minds of almost 
all Frenchmen. <br><br><br><br>

It is a good thing, and a sign of health, that those in a free 
country who represent contrasted social theories should freely 
air their differences. Society to-day being what it is, class 
interests are bound to be at odds. Antagonisms there must be, 
and it is well that they should be recognized. It is only when this 
state of social friction ceases to be regarded as normal and 
legitimate that the country as a whole begins to suffer. <br><br>
More than once in the course of this book I have made use of 
the word <i>bourgeoisie</i>—not without a qualm of conscience. The 
sciences which have human beings as their subject are, at best, 
but empirical, and their pursuit is made more than ever difficult 
when they are cluttered up with words which have become so 
debased by long use that their meaning has ceased to be clear. 
The realities which they express are too complex; the language 
which expresses them too fluid. That, however, is beyond our 
power to alter. Until some better means of communication than 
that of language has been evolved, we must resign ourselves to 
using the only vocabulary which the imperfections of our tongue 
have made available. But it can be used successfully only if 
we define our terms. Let me say, then, that, when speaking of 
Frenchmen I employ the term <i>bourgeois</i>, I mean someone who is 
not dependent for his livelihood on the work of his hands; whose 
income, irrespective of its source and of its size (for it may vary 
considerably from individual to individual), permits him to live 
in easy circumstances, and gives him a sense of security such as 
no mere wage-earner can ever know in his own hazardous 
existence; whose education, enjoyed from birth, if his family 
happens to be an old-establi5hed one, or gained in the course of 
an exceptional rise in the social scale, is richer in texture, better 
in quality, and more pretentious in kind than the minimum 
<b>163</b> cultural training enjoyed by the ordinary man in the street. 
Finally, the <i>bourgeois</i> is a man who believes that he belongs to a 
class which is marked out for leadership in the country’s affairs, 
and, by a thousand little details of dress, language, and good 
manners, shows more or less instinctively that he is one of a 
very special group and enjoys a high degree of prestige in the eyes 
of less fortunate mortals. <br><br>
Now, the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, thus defined, was not feeling any too 
happy in pre-war France. The economic changes which it was 
. the fashion to lay at the door of the last world catastrophe, 
though some of them had other causes, were in process of 
sapping the foundations of those solid, unadventurous fortunes 
which had existed in earlier days when an income from 
investments had formed the sole resource of many families, and was the 
goal of many others whose members were just beginning to 
climb the ladder of success. In the world brought into existence 
by the first war, this kind of livelihood was beginning to melt 
away in the hands of its astonished possessors. The workers 
were setting their faces stubbornly against all attempts to reduce 
wages, with the result that after each recurrent crisis, profits and 
dividends alike grew smaller. The spread of industry in new 
countries which showed an increasing tendency to become self- 
sufficient was producing an ever-worsening condition of anaemia 
in the capitalistic system not only of France but of Europe 
generally. The aggressive mood of the new-comers to the social 
scene was already threatening the economic and political power 
of a group which had long been accustomed to command, and 
had conveniently come to terms with the institutions of a 
democracy to which many of its members had even sworn allegiance. 
As usually happens, custom had lagged behind fact. The 
franchise had been widened to include workers on the land and 
in the factories, but the exercise of the vote had not as yet 
seriously shaken the traditional position of superiority enjoyed, 
outside the capital, by the bigwigs of the middle class. Indeed, 
<b>164</b> to some extent it benefited them, because they were able, partially 
at least, to eliminate from the great offices of state their old 
adversaries of the great noble and near-noble families. 
Untouched by aristocratic arrogance, their outlook on life was 
genuinely humanistic, and it drew strength from a democratic 
system so long as that system did not strike at them through their 
pockets or undermine the solid structure of their very real, 
though modest, prestige. But a day soon came when the voters 
of the lowest category, encouraged in their demands by the 
economic tragedy of the times, began to make their voices heard. 
And what those voices now expressed was something that was 
a great deal more dangerous than it had formerly been. Old 
resentments drew fresh vigour from an exacerbated sense of 
inequality. The <i>bourgeois</i> forced to realize that he had got to 
work a good deal harder than he had done in the past, got the 
idea that the ‘masses’, whose labour was, in the last analysis, the 
source of his own profits, were working less—which was true, 
and even less than he was—which was not, perhaps, equally true, 
and certainly did not take into account the difference in degree 
of human fatigue. He grew indignant at the thought that the 
manual worker had now enough free time to enable him to go to 
the cinema like his boss. The workers’ attitude to money, born 
of a long past of insecurity which had firmly fixed in their minds 
the conviction that it was useless to look ahead, and that the 
morrow could be left to take care of itself, offended his inborn 
respect for the virtue of saving. Even the most charitable- 
minded sought in vain among the crowds parading with clenched 
fists raised, and demanding their rights with a violence which, in 
fact, was no more than a rather crude expression of honest 
frankness, the ‘respectable poor’ who had peopled with such deferential 
charm the novels of Madame de Ségur. The value of discipline, 
of docile good-nature, of a ready acceptance of social differences 
by the less fortunate, had formed the basis of their timid and un- 
adventurous education. And now it looked as though all these 
<b>165</b> things were to be swept away for good and all. With them, they 
felt, would go something far more valuable, that sense of the 
common weal which, little though the comfortably off might 
think it, does demand a greater degree of sacrifice from the poor 
than from the rich. <br><br>
Because, for all these reasons, the members of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> 
had grown anxious and discontented, they now began to show 
signs of bitterness. They might, had they looked a little closer, 
have reached a better understanding of the ‘People’ from whom 
they were themselves sprung, and with whom they had more 
than one deep affinity. But because they were unused to making 
the mental effort which social analysis demands, they preferred 
to condemn out of hand. It would be difficult to exaggerate the 
sense of shock felt by the comfortable classes, and even by men 
who had a reputation for liberal-mindedness, at the coming of 
the Popular Front in 1936. All those who had a few pennies to 
bless themselves with smelled the rising wind of disaster, and the 
good housewife was, if anything, more terrified than her husband’ 
It is the fashion to-day to say that the Jews were behind the Left- 
Wing movement. Poor Synagogue—always fated to act as 
scapegoat! I know, from what I saw with my own eyes, that it 
trembled even more violently than the Church. The same held 
true of the non-Catholic congregations. ‘The old Protestant 
employer’s a thing of the past’—I heard a writer say who had 
been brought up in Nonconformist circles. ‘At one time no one 
could have been more whole-heartedly concerned for the well- 
being of his people than he was, but now he is among the most 
rancorous of their critics.’ A deep fissure was opening almost 
before our eyes in the fabric of French social life. The country 
was splitting into two opposed groups. <br><br>
It is no part of my intention to enter the lists as a champion 
of the Popular Front governments. They are dead now, and 
those who for a moment put their faith in them may, perhaps, 
be allowed to cast a handful of dust in pious memory on their 
<b>166</b> graves. More than this they do not deserve. They fell without 
glory, and what makes it worse is that their adversaries had little 
to do with their overthrow. Events outstripped them, but even 
that is not the whole story. The movement failed mainly because 
of the follies of its supporters, or of those who claimed to be its 
supporters. Still, the attitude of the greater part of middle-class 
opinion was inexcusable. It grumbled with stupid mulishness at 
everything that was done, whether good or bad. One decent 
fellow of my acquaintance obstinately refused to set his foot 
inside the Exposition Universelle. He liked looking at beautiful 
things, and it offered for his enjoyment an incomparable display 
of the glories of French art. But that made not the slightest 
difference. It was enough for him that a detested minister had 
officiated at the opening ceremony! It was said that the demands 
of organized labour had, at one moment, raised doubts as to its 
being ready in time, and that was enough to put it outside the 
pale. And what an outcry there was when the authorities began 
to talk about the organization of leisure! The idea was greeted 
with mockery, and attempts were even made to bring it to 
nothing. Yet the very people who took that attitude then are 
now prepared to extol to the skies similar efforts, made more or 
less seriously, though under a different name, by régimes after 
their own hearts. <br><br>
But whatever the faults of which the movement may have 
been guilty, there was in that striving of the masses to make a 
juster world a touching eagerness and sincerity which ought not 
to have been without effect on any man animated by ordinary 
human feelings. But how many employers of my acquaintance 
have I ever found capable of understanding, for instance, what 
nobility may lie behind a ‘sympathetic’ strike, no matter how 
unreasonable? ‘It isn’t’, they say, ‘as though the men were 
striking for their <i>own</i> wages.’ There are two categories of 
Frenchmen who will never really grasp the significance of French 
history: those who refuse to thrill to the Consecration of our 
<b>167</b> Kings at Rheims, and those who can read unmoved the account 
of the Festival of Federation. I do not care what may be the 
colour of their politics to-day: such a lack of response to the 
noblest uprushes of national enthusiasm is enough to condemn 
them. In the Popular Front—the <i>real</i> Popular Front of the 
masses, not the one exploited by the politicians—something 
lived again of the spirit that had moved men’s hearts on the 
Champ-de-Mars under the hot sun of 14 July 1790. Unfortunately, 
the men whose ancestors pledged their faith on the Altar of the 
Nation have lost contact with the profound realities of national 
greatness. It is no accident that our régime, in spite of all its 
democratic trappings, has never been able to create for the people 
of France festivals capable of sounding a note to the ears of all 
the world. We have left it to Hitler to revive the paeans of the 
Ancient World. When I was with the First Army I saw a good 
deal of certain officers who had been given the task of raising the 
morale of the troops. The High Command had chosen for this 
duty a banker who was a Parisian to his finger-tips, and an 
industrialist from the north. They thought that the best way of 
slipping a few ‘home truths’ into the trench newspapers was to 
give them a plentiful coating of rather crude humour. As to the 
field theatres, well, the more they concentrated on smutty farces, 
the better pleased the authorities were. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> lived 
completely separated from the people. Its members made no 
attempt to reach that understanding which might have led to 
sympathy. Turn and turn about, either they refused to take the 
masses seriously, or they trembled before their implied threat. 
What they did not realize was that, by so doing, they were 
separating themselves effectively from France. <br><br>
As a result of attacking the régime, these same <i>bourgeois</i> 
proceeded, naturally, to condemn the nation which had produced it. 
Driven to despair of their own future, they ended by despairing 
of their country. If anyone be tempted to say that I exaggerate, 
let him re-read the newspapers on which, a few years ago, the 
<b>168</b> middle classes lived, and whose outlook they dictated. He will 
find the experience edifying. At the time when Belgium had just 
rejected the offer of an alliance in favour of a neutrality which 
unhappily turned out to be fallacious, a friend of mine in Brussels 
said: ‘You’ve no idea of the amount of damage done to the 
French cause by your great Weeklies. They declare in every 
issue that France, as a nation, is in an advanced stage of 
putrescence. Well, I’m afraid we believe ‘em. How can you expect 
us not to?’ We ourselves believed them only too well. Many 
men of what might still claim to be our ruling classes, since from 
them were drawn our leaders of industry, our senior civil 
servants, the majority of our reserve officers, set off for the war 
haunted by these gloomy prognostications. They were taking 
their orders from a political set-up which they held to be 
hopelessly corrupt. They were defending a country which they did 
not seriously think could offer any genuine resistance. The 
soldiers under their command were the sons of that ‘People’ 
which they were only too glad to regard as degenerate. No 
matter how high their own courage, no matter how resolute their 
own patriotism, it can hardly be maintained that this was the best 
intellectual preparation for men who would be called upon to 
fight ‘to the last quarter of an hour’. <br><br>
Now, those who provided the personnel for the various 
military staffs were only too ready to share these jaundiced 
points of view. I do not mean that they were all to the same 
extent contaminated. It was by no means true that <i>all</i> regular 
officers, even those in the most senior positions, necessarily 
belonged to the world of hereditary wealth. More than one, on 
the contrary, hailed from a social level which was little, if at all, 
removed from that of the great mass of his countrymen. By the 
nature of their calling, and as a point of honour, they were for 
the most part strangers to the petty outlook of the tradesman. 
The future of capitalism—supposing that they ever had time to 
think about such things—would not have caused them any 
<b>168</b> particular concern, and most of them would have been left 
unmoved by the prospect of a redistribution of the national wealth. 
Almost all of them were men with a strong sense of duty, fervent 
patriots, and very conscious that they were soldiers of France. 
The idea that they might be regarded as the mercenaries of 
certain private interests, or of any one class, would have brought 
a blush of shame to their cheeks. But what did they know of 
social realities? Education, the spirit of caste, tradition, had all 
combined to build around them a wall of ignorance and error. 
Their thoughts were simple. The ‘Left’ meant for them ‘anti- 
militarism’, free thought, and a hatred of that authority which, 
as everyone knows, is the main source of an army’s strength. 
About Socialists they had long known all there was to know. 
They equated the word with the ‘bad’ soldier, the man who 
always has a grouse, and, horror of horrors, sometimes 
communicates his grievances to the Press. Anyone who had dealings 
with ‘Socialists’ became automatically suspect. Even Roosevelt 
had something of the ‘Bolshie’ about him (I actually heard that 
said once by a highly placed staff officer). They were not, as a 
whole, intellectually curious, and they had been trained from 
boyhood to flee from heresy as from the plague. This brief and 
simple orthodoxy was admirably suited to their needs. They 
never made the slightest attempt to acquire information. Among 
the newspapers which lay on our anteroom table, <i>Le Temps</i> was, 
by comparison with its neighbours, a ‘red rag’. And so it came 
about that a whole group of young leaders, recruited from among 
the most intelligent representatives of the nation, never opened 
a daily paper which reflected, even in the smallest degree, the 
opinions professed, rightly or wrongly, by the majority of 
Frenchmen.<br><br>
There is no getting away from the fact that we, the teachers, 
were largely to blame for this state of affairs. I have long felt 
it to be deplorable that men whose proud boast it was in 
recent years that they stood for all that was most liberal, most 
<b>170</b> disinterested, and most humanly progressive, in our country, 
should have been guilty of the serious charge of having made no 
effort whatever to touch the understanding of a professional 
body which enshrined such high moral values. Their failure to 
do so dates, I think, from the Dreyfus affair, and the original 
responsibility does not rest on the shoulders of those who, at 
that time, were on our side of the barricades. But that is no 
excuse for what has happened since. Many a time I have said to 
myself, as I saw my companions drinking in like harmless milk 
the poisonous brew compacted of stupidity and hatred which 
certain squalid sheets continued to dispense even during the 
war: ‘What a shame it is that such fine fellows should be so ill 
informed: what a crying scandal that no one has ever really 
tried to enlighten them.’<br><br>
The fact remains that we are now in a position to measure up 
the results. Ill informed about the infinite resources of a people 
that has remained far healthier than they, as the result of poisonous 
teaching, have been inclined to believe; rendered incapable by 
inherited contempt and by the limited routine of their training 
to call in time upon its inexhaustible reserves of strength, our 
leaders not only let themselves be beaten, but too soon decided 
that it was perfectly natural that they should be beaten. By 
laying down their arms before there was any real necessity for them 
to do so, they have assured the triumph of a faction. Some of 
them, to be sure, strove hard, by backing the <i>coup d’état</i>, to 
disguise their fault. But others there were, in the High 
Command and in almost every rank of the Army, who were very far 
from pursuing any such selfish design. They accepted the disaster, 
but with rage in their hearts. However that may be, they did 
accept it, and long before they need have done. They were ready 
to find consolation in the thought that beneath the ruins of 
France a shameful régime might be crushed to death, and that 
if they yielded it was to a punishment meted out by Destiny to a 
guilty nation. <br><br>
<b>171</b> The generation to which I belong has a bad conscience. It is 
true that we emerged from the last war desperately tired, and 
that after four years not only of fighting, but of mental laziness, 
we were only too anxious to get back to our proper employments 
and take up the tools that we had left to rust upon the benches. 
So behindhand were we with our work that we set ourselves 
to bolt it down in indigestible mouthfuls. That is our excuse. 
But I have long ceased to believe that it can wash us clean of 
guilt. <br><br>

Many of us realized at a very early stage the nature of the 
abyss into which the diplomacy of Versailles and the Ruhr was 
threatening to plunge us. We knew perfectly well that it would 
have the double result of embroiling us with our former Allies 
and of keeping open and bleeding our ancient quarrel with an 
enemy whom we had just, but only just, defeated. We were not 
ignorant of the potentialities of power latent in both Germany 
and Britain. The same, or roughly the same, men whom we have 
heard to-day preaching, before the last hour had struck, the 
gloomy wisdom of Louis XVIII, were then urging us on to ape 
the grandiloquent arrogance of Louis XIV. We were not such 
fools as to believe that in a France impoverished, relatively 
undermanned, and capable of realizing only a very small industrial 
potential, a policy of the kind they contemplated was advisable— 
if, indeed, it would have been so at any time. Not being prophets 
we did not foresee the advent of the Nazis. But we did foresee 
that, in some form or other, though its precise nature was 
hidden from us, a German revival <i>would</i> come, that it would be 
embittered by rancorous memories to which our foolish 
ineptitude was daily adding, and that its explosion would be terrible. 
Had anyone asked us how we thought a second war would end 
we should, I doubt not, have answered that we hoped it would 
end in victory. But we should have been perfectly clear in our 
own minds that if the terrible storm broke again there was grave 
danger that the whole of European civilization might well suffer 
<b>172</b> irremediable shipwreck. We did realize that in the Germany of 
that time there were signs, however timid, of a new spirit of 
goodwill, of an attitude that was frankly pacific and honestly 
liberal. The only thing wanting was a gesture of encouragement 
on the part of our political leaders. We knew all that, and yet, 
from laziness, from cowardice, we let things take their course. 
We feared the opposition of the mob, the sarcasm of our friends, 
the ignorant mistrust of our masters. We dared not stand up in 
public and be the voice crying in the wilderness. It might have 
been just that, but at least we should have had the consolation 
of knowing that, whatever the outcome of its message, it had at 
least spoken aloud the faith that was in us. We preferred to lock 
ourselves into the fear-haunted tranquillity of our studies. May 
the young men forgive us the blood that is red upon our hands! <br><br>
All, or almost all, these things had long been whispered 
among intimate friends: the weakness that was slowly 
undermining the robust health of the nation; the intellectual lethargy 
of our ruling classes, and their bitter grievances; the illogical 
propaganda which was providing so adulterate but so heady a 
draught for our workers; the dominance of age, and the unrest 
in the Army. But how many had the courage to speak their 
thoughts aloud? I know well enough that we lacked the partisan 
spirit, and that is something of which we need not be ashamed. 
Those of us—and they were the exceptions—who let themselves 
be caught up in one or other of the political parties almost 
always ended by being its prisoners rather than its guides. It 
was not to work on electoral committees that our duty should 
have urged us. We had tongues and brains in our heads and pens 
in our hands. But we were all of us either specialists in the social 
sciences or workers in scientific laboratories, and maybe the very 
disciplines of those employments kept us, by a sort of fatalism, 
from embarking on individual action. We had grown used to 
seeing great impersonal forces at work in society as in nature. 
In the vast drag of these submarine swells, so cosmic as to seem 
<b>172</b> irresistible, of what avail were the petty struggles of a few 
shipwrecked sailors? To think otherwise would have been to falsify 
history. Among all the characteristics that mark the rise and fall 
of civilizations, I know of none that is more significant than the 
gradual movement of the collective mind towards 
self-consciousness. In that fact lies the key to many of the contrasts that show, 
however crudely, as between the societies of the past and those 
of to-day. Juridical changes, as soon as they grow large enough 
to be noted, look very different from what they would have done 
had the movement remained purely instinctive. <br><br>
The movements of the Stock Exchange vary according as the 
fluctuation of current prices are or are not known to the aggregate 
of shareholders. But of what is the general mind composed if not 
of a multitude of individual minds which continually act and 
react upon one another? For a man to form a clear idea of the 
needs of society and to make an effort to spread his views 
widely is to introduce a grain of leaven into the general mentality. 
By so doing he gives himself a chance to modify it to some small 
extent, and, consequently, to bring some influence to bear upon 
the course of events which, in the last analysis, are dictated by 
human psychology. The real trouble with us professors was that 
we were absorbed in our day-to-day tasks. Most of us can say 
with some justice that we were good workmen. Is it equally 
true to say that we were good citizens? <br><br>
In thus parading my remorse for things left undone, I am 
actuated by no sense of gloomy pleasure. I have never learned 
from experience that a sin is any the less heavy to bear because it 
has been confessed. No, I am thinking of those who will read 
these words, of my sons certainly, of others perhaps, and they 
may be of a younger generation. I ask them to reflect on the 
faults of their elders. It matters little whether they judge them 
with ruthless severity, or pay them the rather contemptuous and 
grudging tribute of that amused indulgence which adolescents 
are prepared to accord to age. The important thing is that they 
<b>174</b> should realize what those faults were, so that they may be in a 
position to avoid them when their turn comes. <br><br>
We find ourselves to-day in this appalling situation—that the 
fate of France no longer depends upon the French. Since that 
moment when the weapons which we held with too 
indeterminate a grasp fell from our hands, the future of our country 
and of our civilization has become the stake in a struggle of which 
we, for the most part, are only the rather humiliated spectators. 
What will become of us if, by some hideous mischance, Great 
Britain is in turn defeated? Our recovery as a nation will, it is 
quite certain, be long retarded. But <i>only</i> retarded, of that I am 
sure. The deep-seated vitality of our people is intact, and, sooner 
or later, will show signs of recovery. That of nazified Germany, 
on the contrary, cannot endure indefinitely the increasing strain 
which its masters see fit to impose upon it. Foreign systems 
brought into France in the ‘baggage wagons of the enemy’ have, 
on more than one occasion, lasted for a limited time. But the 
detestation of a proud nation has always, in the long run, proved 
too strong, and, sooner or later, sentence has been pronounced. 
Already we feel the iron of occupation eating more cruelly into 
our flesh. The seeming good-nature of the early days no longer 
deceives anybody. We have but to see Hitlerism in its 
day-today manifestations to condemn it. But I would so much rather 
look forward to an eventual British victory! I cannot tell when 
the hour will sound when, thanks to our Allies, we can once more 
control our own destiny. But when it does sound, shall we see 
scraps and corners of our territory liberate themselves 
successively from the enemy? Shall we see wave after wave of volunteer 
armies spring into being all agog to answer to the renewed appeal 
of ‘The Country in Danger’? Maybe some tiny autonomous 
government will suddenly appear in some remote district and 
spread like a patch of oil. It may be, on the other hand, that a 
great surge of national feeling will develop swiftly. An elderly 
historian likes to arrange patterns with these pictures of a pos-
<b>175</b>sible future, though imperfect knowledge makes it impossible 
for him to choose between them. My only hope, and I make no 
bones about it, is that when the moment comes we shall have 
enough blood left to shed, even though it be the blood of those 
who are dear to us (I say nothing of my own, to which I attach 
no importance). For there can be no salvation where there is not 
some sacrifice, and no national liberty in the fullest sense unless 
we have ourselves worked to bring it about. <br><br>
The duty of reconstructing our country will not fall on the 
shoulders of my generation. France in defeat will be seen to 
have had a Government of old men. That is but natural. France 
of the new springtime must be the creation of the young. As 
compared with their elders of the last war, they will have one sad 
privilege: they will not have to guard against the lethargy bred 
of victory. Whatever form the final triumph may take, it will 
be many years before the stain of 1940 can be effaced. It may be 
a good thing that these young people will have to work in a 
white heat of rage. It would be impertinent on my part to 
outline a programme for them. They will search for the laws of the 
future in the intimacy of their heads and of their hearts. The 
map of the future will be drawn as a result of the lessons they 
have learned. All I beg of them is that they shall avoid the dry 
inhumanity of systems which, from rancour or from pride, set 
themselves to rule the mass of their countrymen without 
providing them with adequate instruction, without being in true 
communion with them. Our people deserve to be trusted, to be 
taken into the confidence of their leaders. I hope, too, that 
though they may do new things, many new things, they will not 
break the links that bind us to our authentic heritage, which is 
not at all, or, at least, not wholly, what some self-styled apostles 
of tradition have imagined it to be. On one occasion Hitler said 
to Rauschning: ‘It is very much better to bank on the vices of 
men than on their virtues. The French Revolution appealed 
to virtue. We shall be better advised to do the contrary/ A 
<b>176</b> Frenchman, that is to say, a civilized man—for the two are 
identical—will be forgiven if he substitute for this teaching that of the 
Revolution and of Montesquieu: ‘A State founded on the People 
needs a mainspring: and that mainspring is virtue.’ What matter 
if the task is thereby made more difficult—as it will be? A free 
people in pursuit of noble ends runs a double risk. But are 
soldiers on the field of battle to be warned against the spirit of 
adventure? <br><br>
GUÉRET-FOUGÈRES (CREUSE)<br> 
<i>July-September 1940</i> <br><br><br>

<b>176</b><br><br>
<center><b>THE TESTAMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS OF MARC BLOCH[1]</b></center><br><br>
WHEN death comes to me, whether in France or abroad, 
I leave it to my dear wife or, failing her, to my children, 
to arrange for such burial as may seem best to them. 
I wish the ceremony to be a civil one only. The members of my 
family know that I could accept no other kind. But when the 
moment comes I should like some friend to take upon himself 
the task of reading the following words, either in the mortuary 
or at the graveside. <br><br>

I have not asked to have read above my body those Jewish prayers 
to the cadence of which so many of my ancestors, including my father, 
were laid to rest. All my life I have striven to achieve complete 
sincerity in word and thought. I hold that any compromise with 
untruth, no matter what the pretext, is the mark of a human soul’s 
ultimate corruption. Following in this a far greater man than I could 
ever hope to be, I could wish for no better epitaph than these simple 
words:—DILEXIT VERITATEM. That is why I find it impossible, at this 
moment of my last farewell, when, if ever, a man should be true to 
himself, to authorize any use of those formulae of an orthodoxy to 
the beliefs of which I have ever refused to subscribe. <br><br>
But I should hate to think that anyone might read into this 
statement of personal integrity even the remotest approximation to a 
coward’s denial. I am prepared, therefore, if necessary, to affirm here, 
in the face of death, that I was born a Jew: that I have never denied it, 
nor ever been tempted to do so. In a world assailed by the most 
appalling barbarism, is not that generous tradition of the Hebrew 
<b>177</b> Prophets, which Christianity at its highest and noblest took over and 
expanded, one of the best justifications we can have for living, 
believing, and fighting? A stranger to all credal dogmas, as to all pretended 
community of life and spirit based on race, I have, through life, felt 
that I was above all, and quite simply, a Frenchman. A family 
tradition, already of long date, has bound me firmly to my country. I have 
found nourishment in her spiritual heritage and in her history. I can, 
indeed, think of no other land whose air I could have breathed with 
such a sense of ease and freedom. I have loved her greatly, and served 
her with all my strength. I have never found that the fact of being a 
Jew has at all hindered these sentiments. Though I have fought in 
two wars, it has not fallen to my lot to die for France. But I can, at 
least, in all sincerity, declare that I die now, as I have lived, a good 
Frenchman.<br><br>
When these words have been spoken, the same friend shall, 
if the text can be obtained, read the citations which I received for 
service in the field. <br><br>

[1] The award was actually made in Corps Orders dated July 1942. <br><br>


[1] Let me support this statement by quoting a remark made by General Weygand, 
who was at one time Director of the School of Advanced Military Studies, and, 
later, Commander-in-Chief. It was made on 25 May 1940 (Secret Documents of 
the French General Staff, p. 140). ‘. . . France committed the capital error of 
entering this war without the necessary material, and without that basis of military 
theory which alone could have led to success....’ (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] Much intelligent comment on this question of increased speed, and on its 
effects on thought, is to be found in a small book which few would dream of 
consulting—Charlesworth’s <i>Trade-Routes and Commerce of the Roman Empire</i>. 
See, for instance, what the author says on p. 225, and especially this: ‘Men have to 
be flurried and worried to adjust their minds to a celerity of decision at which our 
grandfathers would have gasped.’ (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] I give the story as it was told me at the time. If my memory of Weygand’s 
Report to the Anglo-French War Council on the 22nd (<i>Secret Documents of the 
French General Staff</i>, p. 130) is correct, he never, in fact, succeeded in making 
contact with Lord Gort. (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] I am now in a better position than I was to realize that, though our military 
equipment was undoubtedly insufficient, it was not lacking to the extent that is 
sometimes supposed. It certainly did not appear at the front in sufficient quantities, 
but that does not mean that farther back there were not plenty of tanks immobilized 
in store, and a considerable number of aeroplanes which never took the air. Many 
of these tanks and aeroplanes had never even been assembled. What, for instance, 
happened at Villacoublay when the Germans were advancing on Paris? Is it true, 
as I have heard, that several aeroplanes had to be destroyed on the ground because 
there were not enough pilots capable of taking them up? The story is by no means 
improbable. I know one peace-time pilot who, though mobilized, was never, in 
the whole course of the war, allowed to handle a military machine. (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] The machine is a new-comer. That, I am sure, is why our professional 
strategists disliked it so much. In a book written by a Frenchman, J. de Pierrefeu 
(<i>Plutarch a menti</i>, p. 300), the following passage occurs: ‘Robert de Beauplan, 
who was sent by the <i>Matin</i> to cover the famous <i>Circuit de l’Est</i> which revealed to 
the people of France the marvels of our national aviation, told me of a remarkable 
conversation which he had had with General Foch (then commanding the Xth 
Corps) at the close of that highly successful display. As the spectators on the 
plateau of Malzéville were going back to their cars, Foch took him familiarly by 
the arm and said : “I won’t deny it’s a delightful sport, but the value of the 
aeroplane for army work is practically zero.” ‘ Compare with this the remarkable 
paper written by Marshal Pétain on the dangers of motorization. But between 1914 
and 1918 even the strategists had had time to learn their lesson. (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] My by-passing became pretty extensive. Officially, the Fuel Park was in 
touch with the Army Commander only through the General Commanding Army 
Artillery, who was himself represented at a lower level by a Director of Munitions 
and Fuel. Had we strictly observed the rules of the hierarchy, it would have meant 
that every order from army to park would have had to go through both these 
senior authorities. In the matter of official documents this system had always been 
observed at Bohain, and the consequent delays caused both me and Lachamp many 
a headache when we thought what might happen under more active conditions. 
Luckily, when the time came, we were able to do a bit of short-circuiting, and, 
thanks to the goodwill of the officers concerned, no sparks flew. <br><br>


[1] I have become more and more convinced that it was the only wise decision 
that could have been taken. What would have been the future of the war if the 
whole British Army had been pounded to pieces on the continent of Europe in 
May and June 1940? Still, it was harsh, and it was asking a good deal of the 
French soldier at the time to see things from so lofty a standpoint. <br><br>


[1] In the Minutes of the War Council held on 26 April 1940 (<i>Secret 
Documents of the French General Staff</i>, p. 98) there occurs a phrase which well illustrates the intolerable vanity of our senior officers. It was uttered by General Gamelin, and runs as follows: ‘It is up to the British to find the bulk of the troops (in Norway). . . . But it is <i>for us to give them moral support, to organise the strategy of the campaign, and to supply the necessary planning and inspiration</i>. . . .’ Alas! (July 1942.) <br><br>

[1] In this matter of the breakdown of liaison between our troops and the 
British Expeditionary Force, see what Churchill said at the Franco-British War 
Council of 22 May, and his telegram of the 24th (<i>Secret Documents of the French 
General Staff</i>, pp. 57 and 132). (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] B. de Jouvenel, in his book, <i>La Décomposition de l’Europe libérale</i>, p. 212, 
has some crushing things to say about the bad habits of our Intelligence Service 
in the days before the war. ‘Our General Staff shows a childish vanity in 
announcing through the medium of the League of Nations Year Book (<i>l’Annuaire militaire 
de la S.D.N.</i>) particulars of troops which, in fact, do not exist at all, of Regulars 
whose enlistment papers have never been received, of Reservists who have not 
been called to the colours. By doing this they merely bolster up the German 
argument.’ See also, for 1914, Joffre’s <i>Mémoires</i>, p. 249, where he makes reference 
to the faulty information which was given to him relative to the German Reserve 
Corps. (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] This weakness in the matter of Intelligence has long been a blemish on French 
Staff work. The Duc de Fezensac, in his <i>Mémoires</i>, records that, on one occasion, 
when he had been told by Ney to take certain orders to one of the Marshal’s 
subordinate general officers, he asked where the latter was to be found. ‘... “No 
comments”—was the answer I got from the Marshal: “don’t like ‘em! .. .” ‘— 
and Fezensac goes on to say—’We were never told where the troops were. No 
movement-orders, no situation-reports were ever shown to us. We had to find 
out as best we could, or, it would be truer to say, we had to guess.’ (Quoted 
by M. Leroy in his <i>La Pensée de Sainte-Beuve</i>, p. 56.) You and I, Lachamp, could 
take that remark of Fezensac’s, and apply it unaltered to our own case—could we 
not? (July 1942.) <br><br>

[1] Presumably the reference is to Frederick the Great. (<i>Translator</i>.)<br><br>


[1] The problem is a grave one. It is nowhere more clearly stated than in the 
first volume of Joffre’s <i>Mémoires</i>. Among other disturbing items, the author 
prints the truly shattering list of general officers whom it was necessary to relieve 
of their duties during the early months of the war. (Between the date of 
mobilization and 6 September 1914 at least one-half of the-divisional commanders on the 
active list were retired, and precisely the same proportion of the commanders of 
cavalry divisions.) Joffre’s remark about a certain corps commander, that ‘he was 
utterly incapable of adapting a peace-time mentality to the needs of war’, was 
obviously true of most of the senior officers thus ‘degummed’—in other words, 
of 50 per cent, of the peace-time generals. Of what use, one may ask, is a military 
education which trains men for everything except war? (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] I have sifted a good deal of evidence in the course of the last two years, and 
am inclined to believe that these cases of cowardice in high places were not so rare 
as we should like to think—after, that is, it became obvious that we had been 
beaten. I have left the text of this part of my book as I originally wrote it, but, 
in the interests of strict truth, I ought, I fear, to stress this fact. The admission is 
painful, and I make it very unwillingly. There can be little doubt that morale was 
very shaky in certain call-up groups (and this applies as much to the regular as to 
the reserve officers)—more shaky, indeed, than we once thought. But if that is so, 
it is no less true that the infection was far from being general. In the very circles 
which produced these instances of cowardice there were many acts of true heroism. 
It is such contrasts that make the writing of history so difficult. Similarly, we 
know only too well that the morale of the nation as a whole left much to be desired, 
and have seen how the morbid elements in the body politic reacted to the crisis. 
In this matter ‘collaboration’ has provided a sure touchstone. (July 1942.) <br><br>


[1] Fernand Pelloutier was a militant trade-union leader in the period 1914- 
18, and played an active part in the administration of the C.G.T. <br><br>

[1] Kienthal is the name of the small Swiss town where, during the First World 
War (in 1916), Pierre Laval met a number of Swiss and German representatives 
and discussed with them the possibility of reaching a ‘Peace by Agreement’. 
After 1940 the expression ‘a man of Kienthal’ was used to describe anyone who 
sought peace at any price—even at the price of national dishonour. <br><br>


[1] The text here printed was given by Marc Bloch to his family at the time when 
he was engaged in clandestine activities. There can be few finer examples of 
beauty of mind expressed in such beauty of handwriting.<br><br>
Four years after writing the ‘Statement of the Evidence’ contained in the 
preceding pages, and one year after committing these last wishes, in which he 
sums up all he had to say, with diamond-like precision, Marc Bloch fell to the 
bullets of a Nazi firing-squad.
