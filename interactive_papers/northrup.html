		<p>
		In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1553</a> word of the arrival of English trading ships reached the capital of the kingdom of Benin in the Niger Delta (Map 2.1). Messengers were dispatched to the port town and escorted the English merchants and their Portuguese guide to the capital, also called Benin. In an audience chamber of his large palace the oba (ruler) welcomed them in Portuguese, a language he had learned as a child, and asked what had brought them to his kingdom. After the English explained their interest in purchasing a large quantity of Benin's pungent pepper, which the Portuguese had earlier introduced to Europe, the oba arranged for the visitors to inspect the sacks of peppercorns in a nearby warehouse. He also requested samples of the goods the English had brought so that his commercial agents might assess their value. So pleased was the oba of Benin with the prospect of opening trade with a second European country (the Portuguese having traded there since <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">1486</a>) that he offered to sell pepper on credit to be repaid on the next voyage, should the English lack sufficient trade goods. In short order eighty tons of pepper were loaded aboard the English ships anchored offshore.
		</p>
		

		<p>
		Coastal West Africans in smaller and less centralized states than Benin also welcomed English traders and showed similar enthusiasm for incorporating new Atlantic trade into their commercial networks. Before reaching Benin, the same English ships had called at the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a>, where Africans exchanged 2,400 ounces of gold for cloth, metals, hardware, and other goods that the English had brought. Even though the Atlantic coast of tropical Africa had been more isolated than regions closer to the Sahara or along the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese, West African societies there had developed marketing networks, professional merchants, systems of transport, and currencies through participation in local and regional trade. Before the arrival of the Portuguese, Benin had conducted inter-coastal trade with the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a>, whose inhabitants prized the kingdom's high quality cotton cloths and stone beads. There is also evidence that Benin and other coastal West African societies had a long history of involvement in trade across the Sahara. For example, the copper used in the exquisite bronze and brass castings of lower Niger societies must have come from Saharan mines <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">before 1500</a>. West African rulers were accustomed to treating long-distance trade as a royal monopoly, and, as the first English visitors to Benin discovered, officials in charge of trade had made considerable progress in understanding European culture and languages since Benin sent its first trade delegation to Portugal in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">1486</a>.
		</p>


		<p>
		The early English could also draw on a rich trading history, but it would take them more than a century to put their trade in West Africa on a solid footing. The commercial success of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1553</a> voyage to Benin could not disguise its disastrous shortcomings. Only a month after anchoring in the Benin River, the ships fled in such haste that some of the English merchants were left behind at the capital. The panicked departure was to escape the tropical fevers that had sickened and killed so many of the officers and crew. One of the two English captains died at Benin and a hundred other members of the expedition perished there or on the voyage back to Plymouth. The high mortality at Benin kept English traders away for three decades, but their trade on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> developed more quickly. John Lok of a prominent London merchant family conducted a trading expedition there in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1554</a>. His account described how <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> Africans richly adorned themselves with ivory and gold and noted their skill and care in weighing gold, but Lok felt it necessary to inform his English readers what an elephant looked like and from which part of its anatomy ivory was obtained. In time, an elephant motif would adorn a new English coin, the golden Guinea, but to get to that point the English needed to ground their West African trade on a firmer basis and to improve their competitive advantage over their European rivals.
		</p>


		<p>
		Despite some royal opposition at home to interfering with Portugal's African trading monopoly, English merchant-adventurers persisted with their African adventures. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1555</a> Lok brought five African men to England from the Portuguese outpost of Shama at the western end of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> so that they might learn English and serve future English merchants as interpreters. At least three of the men later returned and became brokers and intermediaries in the trade, roles that Africans would dominate for the next three centuries. During the next decade, John Hawkins's three voyages to Upper Guinea began the English participation in transatlantic slave trading, but his methods were those of a pirate rather than a merchant. On the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1564</a> expedition, the supposedly defenseless village he raided put up such effective resistance that Hawkins ended up with only ten captives at a cost of 'seven of our best men' with twenty-seven others on the casualty list. Four years later two similar raids produced comparable deaths and injuries but no captives. An attack on a third town was more successful, but, Hawkins noted, the African ruler who had joined forces with him in the attack had also cheated him out of most of the prisoners.
		</p>


		<p>
		Hawkins's rough methods and his interest in slaves were not typical of English ventures in that era. More commonly English merchants sought to improve their techniques for peaceful trading. Thus an English merchant prepared a detailed set of instructions for trading in pepper at Benin in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">1582</a> that included information on the healthiest time of the year to go (the dry season at the beginning of the calendar year) and the more doubtful recommendation that one could ward off illness by consuming four or five heads of garlic with a pint of wine each morning. As late as <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1620</a>, Richard Jobson could still reject a Gambian's offer of slaves, affirming that the English '<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">were a people who did not deale in any such commodities, neither did wee buy or sell one another, or any that had our owne shapes</a>'. However, this aversion to dealing slaves eroded thereafter as a market for slaves developed in English colonies in the Americas.
		</p>


		<p>
		Despite these changes, there is no hint before <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1800</a> of the British colonization and conquest of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> that would come in the nineteenth century or of the expedition that would loot the palace at Benin in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1897</a>. Two important differences in West Africa kept relations there from following the pattern of European conquest and colonization in the Americas. First, early Europeans introduced no new diseases, sparing West Africans the demographic collapse suffered by the inhabitants of the Americas, while tropical diseases remained a formidable impediment to European penetration of most of sub-Saharan Africa and a significant cost of doing business there. Only when quinine came into use against malaria in the mid-nineteenth century did West Africa cease to be 'the white man's grave'. Even had Europeans been willing to endure appalling loses of life, there was a second reason why the conquest of tropical Africa would have been extraordinarily difficult. As Hawkins had learned, African societies in these centuries possessed formidable fighting skills and weaponry. These impediments and West Africans' ability and eagerness to engage in Atlantic exchanges made peaceful commerce a sounder policy.
		</p>


		<p>
		The trade was not without friction, as each side sought to drive the best bargain by both fair means and foul. Once stung by European sharp dealing, West African buyers learned to scrutinize linens for flaws, check basins for holes and knives for rust, and, Europeans complained, count every bead. By the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1660s</a> a German reported, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> traders could tell at a glance the difference between good quality Dutch or Indian textiles and the cheaper imitations made in England and Germany. Worse yet, he lamented, they had devised ingenious ways to cheat the European buyers by mixing gold with lesser substances and no longer permitted Europeans to seize such adulterated gold and punish would-be cheaters. In addition, European price-fixing efforts had collapsed as competing European companies and growing numbers of private traders sought to win over African trading partners with 'sweet words and presents'. If some Europeans were inclined to denounce Africans as thieving, deceitful, and unprincipled, many Africans held similar views of European traders-and with equally good reasons. In one case, Africans denounced suppliers of inferior copper rings as white devils; in another, an African accused of dishonesty, retorted indignantly, 'What! Do you think I am a white man?” Despite such cross-cultural tensions and prejudices, the Atlantic trade thrived. Thus by the mid-seventeenth century, there is little reason to see West Africans' commercial relations with the Atlantic as weak or coerced. Recent historians have argued that Africans participated in the Atlantic trade willingly and from a position of strength. They suggest that the trading relations between coastal Africans and Europeans need to be viewed as a partnership. When one takes into consideration that Europeans were unable to colonize tropical Africa in this era and were thus compelled to purchase and transport a labor force from Africa to the Americas, David Eltis argues, 'the slave trade was a symptom of African strength, not weakness'.
		</p>


		<p>
		No one argues that those shipped in chains from Africa can be counted as anything other than victims, though their powerlessness in shaping New World events is no longer assumed. No African or European trader uniformly made a profit, nor did individuals who profited financially use their gains to uniformly beneficial ends in the long or short run. Whether one considers the African rulers and merchants who grew rich from the trade as successful entrepreneurs or as class exploiters depends on one's interpretative perspectives even more than on the details. The horrific and wrenching experience of those who were taken away from their homes and families into slavery are the subject of other chapters in this volume. The task here is to examine the experiences of those Africans who remained at home (and some who went to Europe), as they sought to profit from the Atlantic trade and the cultural contacts that it brought.
		</p>


		<br>
		<h4>Commercial Relations, 1660-1800</h4>
		<br>


		<p>
		As the volume of the trade shot upwards and slaves became the dominant export, commercial relations between West Africans and Europeans showed both strong continuity and adaptive change over time. On the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a>, Europeans of all nations adopted the early Portuguese approach of seeking local African consent to construct a fortified shore facility (called a 'factory'). By <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1700</a>, Portuguese, Dutch, English, Scandinavian, and German trading companies operated some twenty-five major factories and a about as many smaller trading posts along the 250-mile coast. By then English trade in West Africa was on firmer footing than it had been during the century before <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1660</a>. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1660</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">the Royal African Company (RAC)</a> took over the English factories on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> that the underfunded Guinea Company of London had established between <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1632</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1650</a>, along with a successful outpost on James Island in the Gambia River that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a>'s predecessor, the Company of Royal Adventurers, had opened in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1661</a>. Bolstered by monopoly rights over all English trade with Atlantic Africa, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> moved to fortify its six major <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> outposts against attacks by other Europeans and established its headquarters in the 'castle' it erected at Cape Coast.
		</p>


		<p>
		The many wars among the Europeans in the seventeenth century for access to the African trade are in striking contrast to the largely peaceful relations between Europeans and their African hosts. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> forts were not European colonies or bases for penetration of Africa, but sites of joint enterprises. The African ruler who had authorized the Portuguese to erect their first outpost in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">1472</a> had perceptively emphasized the importance of good relations when he warned that, should the Europeans attempt anything underhanded, he could bring them to their knees simply by withdrawing his trade and the local laborers on whom the factory depended. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the small staff of Europeans stationed on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> still relied heavily on local Africans for labourers, soldiers, and brokers, as well as wives and lovers. Aside from fort slaves who supplied some of the menial labour, most were persons freely pursuing their own interests in a symbiotic relationship with the foreign residents.
		</p>


		<p>
		Both sides underwent changes as the volume and value of the Atlantic trade increased six-fold between the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1680s</a> and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1780s</a>, largely as a result of the rapid expansion of the slave trade. On the European side, chartered national companies lost their monopolies and, saddled with high fixed costs and inefficient practices, eventually slid into bankruptcy. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> continued to operate until <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1752</a>, but private traders dominated English maritime commence with Africa after the Company lost its monopoly in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1698</a>. In contrast to the growing competitiveness among Europeans, the most notable changes on the African side involved greater centralization of the trade. The powerful new kingdoms of Asante and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Dahomey</a> consolidated their control over the trade flowing through the hinterlands of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> and the western Slave Coast respectively, while alliances of professional traders consolidated their economic power in the hinterland of the Bight of Biafra and Senegambia.

		Yet there was also notable continuity in the overall structure of the trade. European remained confined to the coastal entrepots. African merchants brought them slaves from local and distant wars, just as they had once brought gold, ivory, and other products. The relatively minor changes in the nature of imports into Africa were far less significant than was the huge increase in the quantity of trade goods that moved through ever expanding inland regions. At the coast, the greater volume of trade greatly increased the importance of maintaining peaceful relations between Africans and Europeans. An <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> agent advised his employers in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1705</a> that trade at the African coast required 'the same good sense, the same usage, the same cautions, the same harmony ... as [trade 1 in Europe' and stressed the need to treat powerful Africans with kindness and gentleness, to pay them the fees and ground rents that had by then become customary.' In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1752</a> the Board of Trade reaffirmed that 'in Africa we were only tenants of the soil which we held at the good will of the natives'.'4 The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> was healthier for European residents than the rain forests of Benin, but death rates of 20-30 per cent a year remained a price of doing business for the English in the mid-<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1680s</a>. As a consequence, high salaries were necessary to tempt competent European men to serve as agents-general, chief merchants, factors, and chaplains. Another problem was that the irregular arrivals of ships from Europe often left the factories short of appropriate trading goods.
		</p>


		<p>
		A major change was that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> declined in relative importance as the trade shifted eastward in the eighteenth century to ports that specialized in the slave trade. The Bight of Benin became known as the Slave Coast because of its prominence in the trade during the first half of the eighteenth century and the Bight of Biafra became dominant in West African coastal trade during the second half of the century. Africans did not allow Europeans to erect substantial shore facilities on these coasts, so the trade was conducted from the ships or in on-shore trading shanties. As a result, Europeans depended even more heavily on their African hosts for security and for the extensive labour forces they needed to load and unload their ships. Some African rulers appointed officials to oversee the commercial relations with Europeans. For example, by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1720s</a> the post of Yevogan, or 'Chief of the White Men' at the important port of Whydah, had evolved into three separate offices, one for the French, one for the English, and one for the Portuguese. In time there would be six such 'Captains of Trade'.
		</p>


		<p>
		Before a ship could begin to trade in any of these ports, European merchants had to pay elaborate customs fees or 'comey' as well as make expensive gifts to the ruler and to his chief commercial agents. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1700</a> Whydah's ruler exacted comey equal in value to ten slaves from each European slaver to open the market and required them to purchase his own slaves at a premium price before he would let them begin general trading with his subjects. Two decades later, when Whydah had become the greatest trading port along the West African coast, visited by forty to fifty ships a year, the comey had been refined to give the king the value of twenty slaves per ship, first refusal on all goods, and the right to sell his own slaves at a premium. The incorporation of Whydah and other ports into the inland kingdom of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">Dahomey</a> ensured Europeans a rising number of slaves from the expanding kingdom's wars during the second half of the century, but they also had to deal with a more powerful state.
		</p>


		<p>
		At the eastern end of the Slave Coast, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin continued to exercise a tight control over the trade and its profits in the eighteenth century. The Dutch West India Company's agent in Benin wrote a long letter in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1724</a> complaining how difficult it was to conduct the trade there, partly because of rising competition from the English, but particularly because of Benin's resoluteness:
		
		<blockquote>
		the natives here so carefully regulated the trade at the time the factory was established, that it is now impossible to move them to pay more for the merchandise. For if I tell them that the merchandise now costs more [in Europe], they answer me that it does not concern them, that they concluded the trade on those terms at the time, and that they will now continue to trade in the same manner. They say too that they would rather do no trade than to be forced to abandon their old rights and customs.
		</blockquote> 
		
		These conditions led the Dutch to withdraw from Benin, but French, English, and other European merchants continued to submit to a system in which Benin officials unilaterally set the value of all imported goods and exports. Although state-management kept the price of slaves from rising as rapidly as elsewhere in West Africa, the cost of' customs' and gifts to the oba and senior palace officials skyrocketed during the eighteenth century.
		</p>


		<p>
		Benin had a modest share of the slave trade compared to the city-states on the eastern side of the Niger Delta. What these coastal societies lacked in size they made up for in entrepreneurial skills and in good inland connections. The merchant-princes who controlled the trade became rich and powerful. At the end of the seventeenth century, the merchant known as Captain Pepple of the city-state of Bonny was described in a French account as 'a sharp blade, and a mighty talking Black'. For his part, Captain Pepple proclaimed his 'great esteem and regard for the Whites, who had much enriched him by trade', but still drove a hard bargain. To open the trade, Europeans had to give Pepple two muskets, eight hats and nine lengths of cloth as well as other 'dashes'. Several other Bonny notables got the same and the king of Bonny and his principal men exacted loans of goods valued at 300 iron bars (about ￡40 in contemporary terms). By the late eighteenth century, when the Bight of Biafra was the center of the West African slave trade and Bonny its premier port, comey at Bonny had risen to ￡150. At the port of Old Calabar to the east the price of opening the trade might be as much as ￡250.
		</p>


		<p>
		Even after all the preliminaries were satisfied, the conduct of the actual trade took careful planning and skill. According to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">John Atkins</a>, a British naval surgeon who visited the African coast in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1721-23</a> period, a successful voyage to West Africa required a refined knowledge of African tastes and practices on each part of the coast and the cordial treatment of African middlemen. The first step was to assemble a cargo that was suited to African needs and tastes at the intended port of call. Cloth and metals were always in demand, but the colours and patterns of the textiles varied as did the preference for copper, brass, or iron. Coastal Africans assigned each trade item a value in terms of their perception of its desirability and Europeans regularly kept trading accounts in the trading currencies used by their African partners. West African valuations made some trade items, such as French brandy or gunpowder, more profitable for the Europeans, while other items, such as textiles, might be less profitable. Because Africans insisted on a mixture of goods, however, it was hard for Europeans to take advantage of such disparities. Some African currencies had been in use before the Atlantic contacts began, such as the gold ounces of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> and the cowry shells in use on the Slave Coast, while other currencies of account, such as the currencies based on iron bars in Bonny and the Gambia, evolved around trade items supplied in quantity from overseas. 
		</p>


		<p>
		Once forced to peddle domestic imitations of Dutch textiles, the British attracted African buyers with a larger variety of desirable textiles from their East Indian partners than were available to other European merchants. In addition, Britain's highly productive domestic smelters and armorers were able to supply Africans with great quantities of low cost iron, guns, and gunpowder, which became a crucial part of the trade in the eighteenth century. African imports of copper and brass from England also rose from an average of 325 tons a year in the period <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1701-10</a> to 2,860 tons a year in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1791</a>-<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1800</a>. Overall, English exports to Africa increased 780 per cent during the eighteenth century. Yet it would be misleading to see this tremendous increase in the volume of the trade as an expansion of European dominance in Africa. As important as Europeans' capital, colonies, and control of ocean shipping were in creating the Atlantic economy, such factors did not give them an upper hand in the tough bargaining that took place along the West African coast. Instead, as economic historians have demonstrated, the terms of trade shifted sharply in the African traders' favour during the eighteenth century, as the prices of slaves and other African exports rose more rapidly than the prices of the goods received in return. By one calculation, this shift in the terms of trade meant that a slave cost the English twice as much at the end of the century as at its beginning.
		</p>


		<p>
		Just as British traders' success in garnering the lion's share of the eighteenth- century slave trade depended on satisfying African commercial demands, the most successful African ports were those best able to sell European traders a large volume of slaves under predictable trading conditions. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">Dahomey's</a>  military expansion was a part of the port of Whydah's success, but other ports along the Bights of Benin and Biafra that were not part of any large state also found ways to deal effectively with the merchants of powerful European states. Despite its reputation for tough bargaining and decentralized political organization, the city-state of Bonny in the eastern Niger Delta became one of the most important trading ports in West Africa because of its close ties to inland trading networks that ensured its steady supply of slaves. Further east, the cluster of Efik lineage groups the Europeans called Old Calabar was also successful in forging ties with a variety of inland trading groups and in transforming a traditional graded secret society known as Ekpe into an organization that was able to settle disputes between trading partners thus minimizing interruptions in the flow of slaves and trade goods. In time, British traders found joining Ekpe was an aid in collecting debts.
		</p>


		<p>
		Such debts were a growing feature of the trade. In contrast to Benin's offer of credit to the first English traders, eighteenth-century African traders often insisted on receiving goods on credit and, as European accounts make clear, frequently defaulted on such loans. To curtail their losses at Old Calabar and other West African ports, European traders increasingly made use of the West African custom of pawning. African merchants receiving goods on credit handed over human pawns to European slavers in pledge of repayment. The pawns might be domestic slaves, other members of their households, or even their own children. If the debt was not repaid before the ship sailed, the pawn became a part of the slave cargo. Last minute efforts to avert such eventualities were not always successful.
		</p>


		<p>
		In this case time worked against the African pawns and pawners, but the time was running out for the European slavers. The sooner a vessel could obtain a cargo, the lower the losses of life among both slaves and crew. Thus, while Europeans bargained hard over prices and inspected slaves carefully for any disease or defect that might reduce their value, as their time on the coast lengthened, they were constrained to make compromises that would hasten their departure. Whereas it was once assumed that the age and sex distribution of slave cargoes was entirely determined by European preferences, modern research on the notable variations among African ports strongly suggests a more complex explanation. As David Eltis puts it: 'Africans, as much as Europeans, shaped who entered the trade, the geographical patterns of the traffic, the conditions under which slaves travelled to the New World, and, indeed, what slaves did when they arrived in the New World.
		</p>


		<br>
		<h4>Effects in Inland Africa</h4>
		<br>
		

		<p>
		The Atlantic trade's operations along coastal West Africa are reasonably well documented, but the absence of observations of its impact makes its effects in inland Africa much harder to assess. Still one can safely assume that the impact of Atlantic imports was much more diluted there than at the coast. Most of luxury goods the coastal big men received as comey and presents went no further than their own households, and the considerable mark-up on the luxury goods that West African traders carried inland would have limited their market to a few notables. However, the composition of the trade goods received from the Atlantic suggests that there was a large inland market for the ordinary textiles, metals, and manufactures. Despite the rapid growth of these imports during the eighteenth century, recent analysis casts considerable doubt on the once common assertions that they damaged local manufactures. Atlantic imports supplemented rather than displaced locally made products in the inland regions. The quantity of the imports was not large on a per capita basis before <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1800</a> and transportation and distribution costs would have reduced their competitiveness as the moved away from the coast. Only as industrialization caused a much sharper drop in prices during the nineteenth century did the per capita consumption of such imports and their geographical reach begin to affect local production. Improved transportation systems under colonial rule in the twentieth century lowered prices and increased sales still more.
		</p>


		<p>
		For those millions who were victims of the slave trade from Africa the consequences of the Atlantic contacts were obviously dire as several later chapters in this volume detail. The impact of their loss within Africa, however, is harder to calculate. It has long been understood that the majority of slaves were captured in wars, but where it was once common to blame most wars in West Africa on the slave trade, modern historians recognize that such an assumption greatly exaggerates the influence of Atlantic trade on West African statecraft. Warfare and enslavement had accompanied the rise and fall of states well before the Atlantic slave trade arose and continued to be prominent after the overseas slave trade declined. While it is reasonable to assume that the Atlantic slave trade had some effect on inland conflicts, objective measurement is impossible. Nor is subjective assessment any clearer. African rulers were as likely as monarchs in Europe to claim their wars were just and not fought for base motives. The Asante ruler Osei Bonsu, for example, insisted to a British visitor in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1820</a> that he and his predecessors went to war for the highest reasons of honour and statecraft and did not 'make war to catch slaves in the bush, like a thief. Still, his statement implies that less honourable men would have succumbed to the temptations brought by the Atlantic economy.
		</p>


		<p>
		Speculation on the Atlantic slave trade's consequences has long assumed that larger states were able to defend their interests much better than the smaller chiefdoms and village groups that contained most of West African's population during these centuries. However, recent research has questioned whether such 'stateless' societies were really unduly vulnerable. Although examples of extreme vulnerability can be found, as a group the inhabitants of small and decentralized polities do not appear to have been more victimized than those who inhabited larger states. Small communities would have been as capable of defending themselves against attacks by their African neighbours as they were against Hawkins's raids. Moreover, some of their members were quite successful in profiting financially from the trade. Martin Klein concludes his recent survey of this issue with the telling observation 'The logic of the state was not as irresistible as the logic of the market. From that perspective, the customary emphasis on the effects of the slaves exported from Africa misses the possibly more important effect of the goods imported. These imports required greater carriage, achieved wider distribution, and involved far more numerous transactions as they moved inland from the coast than did the export of slaves. Combined with the expanding internal trade in African produce and manufactures, the imports were part of a general expansion of markets and trade routes. Thus the trade in slaves deserves to be seen as a piece, rather than the centrepiece, of the economic changes underway in West Africa.
		</p>


		<p>
		Although the political and social impact of the slave trade within Africa are now seen in more complex terms than was once the case, modern research on the volume of the Atlantic slave trade has facilitated the calculation of its probable effects on Africa's population. A sophisticated demographic model developed by Patrick Manning finds that while losses varied considerably over time and place, the regions of the tropical Atlantic Africa most affected would have seen their populations stagnate as the slave trade rose in the first half of the eighteenth century and then would have experienced a steady decline in population during the peak centuries of the slave trade. By <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1850</a> the population of the western coastal region of Africa would have been between a sixth to a quarter lower than it had been in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1700</a>- a severe population loss by any measure, but it would have recovered quickly thereafter. Manning's work has found general acceptance among historians, but because such modeling is based on assumptions about population size and normal birth and death rates rather than hard evidence, its conclusions are only a reasonable hypothesis.
		</p>


		<br>
		<h4>Personal and Cultural connections</h4>
		<br>
		

		<p>
		Commercial interests created the Atlantic exchanges in West Africa, but some Africans and Europeans found more in these exchanges than a pursuit of profit. Some individuals had cross-cultural experiences that were richer than the conduct of the trade itself necessitated. A few Europeans became interested enough to write books about Africa. Some Africans also wrote about their experiences, but it is notable that both their literacy and the fact that they wrote in European languages were products of cultural changes occasioned by Atlantic contacts. Other cross-cultural contacts were more intimate. Some Europeans whose commercial duties kept them in Africa for years on end took African lovers and raised Eurafrican families, just as some Africans who lived in Europe fathered families by European wives.
		</p>


		<p>
		At the most basic level, Africans and Europeans needed to communicate effectively if they were to succeed commercially. As was related earlier, John Lok had followed the early Portuguese practice of taking a few Africans back to Europe and training them as translators, but compulsion soon became unnecessary. Recognizing the advantages to be gained, West Africans soon seized the initiative in learning Europeans' languages and national traits. The precedent set by the oba of Benin in greeting the first English visitors in a European language was followed everywhere. As the trade grew, coastal African rulers and merchants learned to converse with European visitors in their own languages, whereas it was a rare European who learned more than a few words of any African language. The key African employee in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> forts was known as the '<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">linguist</a>', even though his diplomatic skills were as important as his skills in European and African languages. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Linguists</a> conducted delicate negotiation with African rulers and merchants on behalf of the Europeans and were accordingly well compensated. For example, Quacounoe Abracon (as the English spelled his name) functioned as the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a>'s chief broker at their Little Komenda 'factory' from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1681</a> to about <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1683</a> and represented the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> in its dealings with the settlement's political leaders. In addition to profits from his personal trading, he received an annual stipend of 3 ounces in gold and commissions on sales for the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> that may have garnered him 40 ounces a year-enough to make him a wealthy man locally.
		</p>


		<p>
		As the British became dominant in the Atlantic trade in the eighteenth century, a new trading pidgin using English words developed, overlaying and displacing an older pidgin based on Portuguese vocabulary. Along with standard European languages, pidgin English was widely used in communication between Africans and Europeans and in some parts of West Africa it became a lingua franca among Africans as well. Some of the most successful Africans acquired a good command of standard European languages and customs through formal education in Africa or in Europe. The first English medium school in sub-Saharan Africa was opened by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1694</a> to educate the African and Eurafrican children living around its headquarters at Cape Coast Castle. Britain's first missionary to West Africa established a new school at Cape Coast Castle in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1752</a> at the request of the official <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">linguist</a>, Cudjo. Among its first pupils was Cudjo's relative Philip Quaque, who continued his studies in England, where he was eventually ordained an Anglican priest. Upon his return to Cape Coast in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1765</a>, Quaque became the official chaplain to the English traders stationed there and also served as catechist and schoolmaster to the African population. John Currantee, the chief caboceer (headman) at the English fort of Anomabu, sent his son William Ansah to Britain to study in the late <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1740s</a>. During the decade Ansah spent there, the English lavishly entertained and lionized him. King George II sent him back in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1750</a> in the British warship, HMS Surprise, richly clothed as an English gentleman. William Ansah readapted to coastal life and worked as a clerk and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">linguist</a> at the Anomabu fort. Ansah was not the first West African to be received at court. In the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1730s</a> a Gambian Muslim named Ayuba Suleiman had been similarly treated by English notables, received by King George, and despatched back to his home with rich presents in an <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> ship. Along the Bight of Biafra, some Old Calabar traders also sent their sons to be educated in England and when they returned some of these scholars tutored children of elite families in spoken and written English. A leading African merchant of Old Calabar in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1780s</a> even kept a diary in a rough form of English.
		</p>


		<p>
		Some late eighteenth-century rulers in Sierra Leone also pursued trading advantages through formal education. One sent a son to study with the English Christians and another inland to study with African Muslims. In the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1790s</a> a prominent Sierra Leone chief named Naimbana went one better by educating one son locally as a Muslim, sending a second abroad to France, and a third, John Frederic, to London. There John Frederic mastered the intricacies of reading English in eighteen months and progressed rapidly in a range of studies. Although he became a sincere Christian, John Frederic was quick to take offence at anyone impugning his homeland. On one occasion, he became enraged when a Member of Parliament, in defending slavery, made disparaging remarks about Africans. John Frederic declared that while he could forgive someone who robbed him, shot at him, or even sold him into slavery, but not someone who made racist and disparaging remarks about Africans, for 'if anyone takes away the character of black people, that man injures black people all over the world'. Nothing justified enslaving and abusing people because of the colour of their skin.
		</p>


		<p>
		By the late eighteenth century, other West Africans in Britain were taking the defense of their homeland into a spirited campaign against the slave trade. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1787</a> Ottobah Cugoano, son of a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> chief, published Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evils of Slavery, in which he called for a naval patrol to suppress the slave trade from Africa and for the emancipation of all slaves in the Americas. The book denounced the inhuman and unchristian enslavement of Africans as 'an injury and robbery contrary to all law, civilization, reason, justice, equity, and charity'. His prediction that slaves might well rise up and overthrow the institution was remarkably prescient of the events that would unfold in Saint Domingue (Haiti) in the next decade. Cugoano's friend and fellow Afro-Briton Gustavus Vassa added to the campaign in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1789</a> with the publication of his remarkable and highly literate autobiography The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano. In this more subtle attack on the slave trade, Vassa (as he almost always identified himself outside the autobiography) described his early life in the hinterland of the Niger Delta, his kidnapping, and transportation in the Middle Passage.
		</p>


		<p>
		Although this early part of the book may have been fictionalized, the verifiable details of his subsequent life in slavery, his emancipation and resettlement in Britain, and his mastery of English and embrace of Christianity, and his other personal achievements were a moving indictment of the false image of Africans as inferior and destined for slavery. Both works found a wide and sympathetic audience, Vassa's going through eight more editions in Britain before his death in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1797</a>. Although a few eighteenth-century West Africans used their education and talents to pursue clerical and literary careers in the Anglophone world, most Africans were motivated by the commercial advantages they hoped to gain in bridging cultural barriers. Brandy, Dutch gin, and other distilled spirits introduced from Europe lubricated the trade negotiations and continued commercial success required resolving the details amicably. Three different English agents were discharged by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> for failing to stay on good terms with John Kabes, a prosperous African middleman known for his success in playing off the English and Dutch on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">1688</a> to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1722</a>. In some cases European and African traders became genuine friends. For example, a leading trader in eighteenth-century Bonny known as John Africa was highly regarded by English traders for his honesty and generosity. On one occasion, he bestowed a rich gift of ivory tusks on one of his English partners 'in so delicate a manner, as would have done honour to an European of refined sentiment'.33 The need to stay on good terms was mutual.
		</p>


		<p>
		Some commercial relations in West Africa were also sexual. In contrast to the coerced favours and rapes that took place on some slaving ships, sexual contacts on African territory had to be consensual or there would be big trouble with local authorities. Some encounters were casual, but many European men who took up residence in Africa developed long-term relationships with African women. Under European law some of these 'country marriages' were bigamous, for the men might have another wife in Europe, but polygyny was permitted under African law. It is impossible to say if Englishmen entered into these relationships with the same frequency as the French and Portuguese, but prominent examples are not hard to find. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> officials and ship captains in Sierra Leone built houses next to the official buildings for their country wives, whom they clothed in silk gowns. Circumstances were similar on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a>, where the Director-General of Cape Coast Castle in the early eighteenth century had four children by a local wife. He was a kind father and so devoted to his wife that at her urging he openly wore protective charms and amulets to safeguard his health. She, however, steadfastly refused to leave her homeland (lest she be seen as a slave) but did yield to his entreaties to allow their children to be educated in England. The head of the English factory at Tantumkweri in about <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1770</a>, John Cockburn, had several children by his African wife Ambah.
		</p>


		<p>
		Like the business friendships, 'country marriages' often had commercial benefits for both partners. Prominent African men sometimes promoted ties between female family members and resident European traders as a way of gaining better access to Atlantic goods. Similarly, European men sought not just a sexual partner but someone who could interpret local African speech and customs and had connections to African trading families and networks. There is only limited information about how the African women felt about such relationships, but they and their relatives seemed to have been pleased with the presents and other benefits they received. There were often long term financial advantages for the woman as well, since she might inherit considerable sums in the likely event that tropical diseases made her a widow. Ambah Cockburn lived simply after her husband's death, but some other widows and daughters inherited sufficient wealth to become important in their own right. For example, Betsy Heard, the daughter of an African woman and an English merchant, who had sent her to England for her education, used her considerable talent and inherited wealth to become a major trader in Upper Guinea in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1790s</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1800s</a>. In the same region, another upwardly mobile woman, Elizabeth Frazer, was the daughter of an African-American settler and one of his African wives. After her marriage, in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">1826</a>, to William Skelton, Jr., the son of an African mother and an English father, she became wealthy in slave trading in the Rio Nufiez. Yet another prominent entrepreneuse was Mary Faber, the daughter of African-American settlers and wife of an Anglo-American ship captain.
		</p>


		<p>
		Children born to these unions tended to be comfortable in the cultures of both parents and often played important roles as culture brokers. Some mixed marriages founded important dynasties. The prominent Corker- Caulker family of Sierra Leone traces its origins to the union of an <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">RAC</a> official and Seniora Doll, Duchess of Sherbro. The locally influential Brews of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Gold Coast</a> are descended from Richard Brew, an Irish trader and official in the mid-eighteenth century, and Effua Ansah, the daughter of the African caboceer John Currantee and sister of William Ansah. Their two daughters were baptized in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1767</a> by the Revd Philip Quaque and a son later married a member of Quaque's family.
		</p>


		<p>
		These country marriages in Africa have an interesting parallel in the unions African men in Europe formed with European women. Most African students and visitors may have remained celibate or had casual affairs, but those who stayed on regularly chose brides from among local women. Perhaps the most famous was Gustavus Vassa, who after thirty-five years of residence in Britain married Susanna Cuilen in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">1792</a>. Four years earlier the successful author and abolitionist had published his views on mixed marriages:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		If the mind of a black man conceives the passion of love for a fair female, [it should not be that] he is to pine, languish, and even die, sooner than an intermarriage be allowed, merely because ... [of] foolish prejudice ... God looks with equal goodwill on all his creatures, whether black or white-let neither, therefore, arrogantly condemn the other.
		</blockquote>


		<p>
		In a thoughtful essay, historian Seymour Drescher argues that British people in this era exhibited 'tolerance of many black people ... as socially acceptable marriage partners' despite some vocal opposition. Intermarriage was at least equally acceptable in West Africa, where it would be difficult to find any voice raised against the practice. Such toleration, of course, did not extend to British colonies in the Americas.
		</p>


		<br>
		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<br>


		<p>
		While promoting European colonies in the Americas, Atlantic contacts created cultural and economic opportunities for some coastal Africans. Although those in a position to benefit were fewer in number than those shipped into slavery from these shores and made up only a very small percentage of West Africa's population, their lives illuminate two important themes that deserve to be understood apart from the miseries of the slave trade and slavery detailed in the chapters that follow. In the first place, their lives show that coastal West Africans were eager to participate in the Atlantic economy and succeeded in doing so effectively before, during, and after the transatlantic slave trade. The early part of the Atlantic connection was not dominated by the slave trade and whatever destruction that trade brought during its peak centuries; historians largely agree that its long-term effects in Africa were limited. The consumer goods Africans received did not produce an economic transformation in Africa comparable to those taking place in the Atlantic world as a whole. Neither were the imports of sufficient quantity to undermine indigenous industries. Manning's model also suggests that the population loss occasioned by the export of so many millions of people would have been reversed a few decades after the Atlantic slave trade's peak.
