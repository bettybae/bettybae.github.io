“CHAPTER TWO – Copper Thieves” from Chad B. Denton, <i>Requistions and Resentment: Mobilizing Metal for Total War</i> (unpublished book manuscript, revised October 2016)
<br>

<br><br><br>
— “Le vol des cuivres” —
<br><br><br>

In late May or early June 1917, Alfred Dujardin stopped in the street to read a freshly posted declaration signed by the German military commander of occupied Lille. Hopeful that the green poster might announce some good news and unable to read the fine print, Dujardin ran up to it only to find, in dismay, that it ordered the seizure of more than 30 categories of raw materials including furs, hay, straw, sheep, cows, leather, rubber, paper, shoes, underwear, oil, glycerin, thread, vases, varnishes, and metals. For metals, the poster specified all objects made “entirely or principally of aluminum, copper, nickel, tin, lead, zinc or alloys of these metals, notably brass, [and] bronze . . . with the exception of jewelry or medical tools.” Dujardin, a medical doctor, had at his home several pewter syringes he used in his practice—these were exempt. But he also had a set of copper and brass pots and pans, a nickel coffee maker, and a collection of small bronze statues that he was quite fond of. Reading through his bifocals, Dujardin saw that he had to declare these objects to the economic office of the local military administration, the <i>Wirtschafts-Ausschuss, </i>or face criminal penalties: either fines or imprisonment.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> 
<br><br>
When Dujardin returned home, however, he did not immediately fill out a declaration form. Instead, he wrote a poem. Titled <i>“A la Wirtschaftsausschluss</i>” (either a slight misreading of the German or a clever play on words), the poem opened with Dujardin’s encounter with the green poster, “a very tender green, the color of hope,” and his disappointed discovery that the “odious order” written in the “language of a bailiff” demanded nothing less than “the complete confiscation of captive Lille’s sad possessions.” In short, rhyming lines, he described the various objects, insulted the military commander (calling him a <i>filou </i>or “crook”), and imagined the immediate reaction of his neighbors, who might fearfully see this poster as evidence of German strength. Objecting to such defeatism, Dujardin predicted that a ragtag army of British, French, American, and colonial troops would soon defeat the Germans, who he saw as nothing more than common “purse snatchers” and “pick pockets.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
<br><br>
Within weeks, those “purse snatchers” visited Dujardin’s home. Either because of a declaration form or an unannounced search (Dujardin was not clear on this point) German requisition agents confiscated his three bronze statues. Once again, Dujardin documented the event in verse, in a eulogy titled simply “Good-bye my bronzes.” Dujardin began with his most treasured bronze, a Barbedienne reproduction of Paul Dubois’ <i>The</i> <i>Florentine Singer. </i>A wedding present from his grandmother, it reminded him of “happy days, the nuptial bond and his loves” and offered comfort “for his sad widowhood.” He concluded his poem by describing how he stoically handed over his treasures: “And giving up my statues / to the clawed hands of the Germanic thieves / without shedding tears . . . I saw them leave / looters without repentance.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> 
<br><br>
From the arrival of German forces on October 13, 1914, to their departure on October 17, 1918, Dujardin wrote 139 poems, which he hid from the prying eyes of the German military police in the pages of dusty books and bundles of old clothes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> He shared them as well. During the war, with the shutters closed, he gave underground poetry readings to his family members and friends by the hearth “stripped of its copper treasures.” In 1919, after “a long and legitimate hesitation,” he decided to publish them as a testimony to the difficulties of everyday life in occupied Lille.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> 
<br><br>
Dujardin’s five metal requisition poems illustrate, in microcosm, one example of the brutal policies the German military inflicted on both its domestic and occupied populations from 1914 to 1918.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> Like Mary Ethel McAuley’s observations about requisitions in wartime Berlin, these poems accurately capture Germany’s increasingly radicalized process of economic exploitation, described by Isabel Hull as a “spiral of extremity.” What Dujardin experienced in occupied Lille—the metal requisitioning policies and procedures, the objects targeted, and the quantities seized—was the norm in Germany, Austria-Hungary, and all of occupied Europe.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> 
<br><br>
Yet the poems provide more than just an illustration of requisition policy; they offer a window into the human impact of those requisitions: the loss of family heirlooms and artistic treasures, the experience of searches and seizures, and the inability to effectively retaliate. And Dujardin’s personal experience—though presented in a unique fashion—was not exceptional. Numerous diaries (written and preserved under the threat of criminal prosecution), detailed registers of German requisitions kept by local mayors, and journalistic accounts from 1914 to 1918 amply documented the German pillage and provided fodder for memoirs, French governmental reports, and studies of daily life under the occupation published in the immediate postwar period.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>  The particularly extensive testimony from individuals like Dujardin who lived in Lille, the largest city in occupied northern France, reveals how people responded to these requisitions (whether by declaring metal, hiding it, denouncing their neighbors or aiding German metal inspectors) and how they drew the line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> 
<br><br>
In France, the personal, everyday experience of requisitions shaped not only the behavior toward the occupying force—from willing cooperation to armed resistance—but also the postwar memory of occupation. Though the occupied areas were relatively small (just 3.7% of French territory), the published diaries, memoirs, document collections and novels with titles like “The Martyrdom of Lille,” “Slaves of the Huns,” “Under the Iron Fist,” “Four Years with the Barbarians,” “50 Months Under the German Yoke,” and “Invasion ‘14” popularized the experience of civilians living in cities such as Lille, Lens, Laon, Cambrai, and Sedan for a broader French-speaking audience.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> Their experience of German requisitions, in turn, influenced perceptions of both French economic collaboration and passive resistance during the Second World War when the “copper thieves” returned.

<br><br><br>
— A Tidily Organized Theft —
<br><br><br>

In 1920, Fritz Herms, a German lawyer and political scientist published an apologetic account of the German occupation in Lille titled <i>Lille Raped? </i>[<i>Lille vergewaltigt?</i>]. Reacting to the flood of publications describing atrocities in the occupied city, Herms promised to tell the German people “the pure truth.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> With the support of the German Foreign Ministry and the <i>Reichswehr</i>—the small military force permitted by the Versailles treaty—Herms gained access to the administrative files of the German authorities in occupied Lille. In an appendix, he printed transcriptions of 87 of these official documents, written in both French and German, from official decrees to private correspondence between Lille’s military commander and various French political and religious authorities. Through his selective reading of these documents, Herms responded point by point to French accusations—”from the murder of innocent children” to “the continuous looting [<i>Plünderung</i>] of the elegant houses of French families.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> In each of these cases, Herms argued that the German actions followed international law, that they relied on the active “cooperation” [<i>Zusammenarbeit</i>] of French authorities, and that they followed strict procedures in order to minimize the harm caused. For the metal requisitions experienced by people like Dujardin, Herms claimed, first, that the requisitions had been forced on the Germans because of the British “blockade measures completely contrary to international law,” and second, that the Germans agreed to offer compensation at the armistice for all seized objects following the Hague Convention. For this final measure, Herms pointed to the extensive record-keeping carried about by the German requisition teams, namely, that “a detailed register was kept logging the ascribed objects.” “Somebody who only wants to steal,” Herms concluded, “does not need to keep a register.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> 
<br><br>
Herms’s defense of German behavior was part of what Isabel Hull has described as an extensive postwar “innocence campaign” waged by the German Foreign Ministry through paid journalists, newly-founded research institutes, and the selective publications of diplomatic documents.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Though she does not cite Herms, Hull discounts works like his as willfully mendacious propaganda. To be sure, keeping a register has very little to do with whether or not theft is being committed, it could just as easily mean that one wants to know exactly how much, and what, has been stolen. Yet Herms’s arguments, though largely unconvincing, do offer a window into how the Germans justified their actions. Furthermore, in many cases Herms’s documentary evidence corroborates French memoirs, diaries, and municipal administrative records, even when his interpretations of that evidence may have differed. A close chronological reading of these German and French sources shows that when it came to the metal requisitions in occupied Lille, it was, in the words of newspaper editor Martin-Mamy, “a tidily organized theft.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> 
<br><br>
Though briefly occupied from September 2 to 3, the continuous occupation of Lille did not begin until the capitulation of French forces on October 13, 1914.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> For the next four years the city remained under the control of the <i>Kriegs-Etappen </i>of the Bavarian 6th Army. As in the rest of occupied northern France, German troops requisitioned goods from the population and provided written documentation for the seizures. In the case of Lille, the occupation authorities initially attempted to appease local opinion by assuring that everything taken would be reimbursed. On September 2, when the Germans first arrived, Rear Echelon Inspector General Lieutenant von Bertrab posted proclamations guaranteeing that private property would be respected and that “no requisition would be made, no seizure would be undertaken, and nothing would be sold without paying cash.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a>  Similarly, on October 13, Lille’s first military governor, Major General Franz Wahnschaffe issued a decree promising that “everything the German authority receives and everything the soldiers request for their own use will be paid for, [and] if needed, a tax will be established by a special commission.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a>  His successors von Heinrich and von Gravenitz, as well as the echelon commander Schmidhuber, all reaffirmed that promise.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> 
<br><br>
Lille’s inhabitants old enough to have experienced the Franco-Prussian war knew not to trust these promises. On August 11, 1870, Kaiser Wilhelm I had made a similar declaration when he proclaimed to the people of northern France, “I am waging war on French soldiers and not on the inhabitants, whose people and property will be assured.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>  During that war, Prussian troops in places like Sedan emptied private homes of all their valuables, piling them on old wooden carts and dividing up the spoils by rank.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a>  Especially as food supplies dwindled in the winter of 1870, Prussian troops seized whatever they could get their hands on from French villages. The enlisted men described these seizures as “requisitions,” but soon adopted the new slang, “<i>rollen</i>” commonly using the phrase “<i>hast du etwas gerollt?</i>” or “have you swiped anything today?”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a>  Lille was spared occupation from 1870 to 1871, but when the Germans arrived in the fall of 1914, their behavior must have rekindled memories of those earlier Prussian invaders.
<br><br>
Required by their superiors to document their requisitions, German soldiers— “often arrogant and sometimes drunk”—falsified and forged requisition papers to acquire the wine, food, and other goods they desired. In one case, a soldier made off with an automobile after presenting a fake requisition order that he had made by rubbing carbon paper over the face of a German coin.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>  Unable to control this unrestrained looting, von Graevenitz—the second commandant who managed relations between the civilian population and the German soldiers—called a conference at the <i>Kommandantur</i> at the end of November.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>  He created a special office at Lille’s city hall and required that all requisition orders receive the mayor’s signature and seal. The commandant von Heinrich met with municipal officials two days later to explain the procedure.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a>  As part of this attempt at ostensibly controlling these requisitions, they established a process whereby individuals could petition the authorities if they had goods requisitioned “irregularly,” either “obtained by fraud or by violence.” If the petitioner could give exact details of the soldiers—including regiment, names, and numbers—they could go directly to the German military police; if they did not have that information, they could appeal to the Financial Services office of city hall and request that French authorities open an investigation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a>  Not surprisingly, the mayor’s office was soon inundated with paper.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> 
<br><br>
As Thomas Weber has shown, the attitude of the German troops towards the suffering they had inflicted on Lille varied in degrees of empathy. The commander of the Bavarian troops Crown Prince Rupprecht noted in his diary on October 13 his “compassion for the hard-hit city.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>  The Catholic chaplain of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment or List Regiment was struck by “the smoking piles of rubble everywhere, along with crying and begging women and children, and withdrawn, sullen men.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a>  Another soldier in that unit, a twenty-five-year old dispatch runner, had less charitable thoughts. In early December, young Adolf Hitler wrote that though “parts” of Lille had been “shot up or burnt down by us . . . the town has suffered little.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a>  At the same time, a German Jewish soldier commented that compared to “the mud of battle” the city felt “almost like peacetime,” though he could not “avoid seeing how wretched and impoverished many French civilians look and how grieved they must be feeling.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a>  Two months later, Major Albrecht von Thaer, the recently named chief of the general staff of the IX Reserve Corps, acknowledged in a diary entry the suffering caused by requisitions under his command:

<blockquote>We behave decently as enemies, when possible. But selfishness for our troops is simply an obligation. . . . Even in such large cities like Lille, for the most part, the people (rich and poor) have already had their beds and blankets taken away for our soldiers, even the small iron stoves, which are always in front of the fireplace, have already moved into the trenches.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a></blockquote>

As elsewhere in occupied northern France, the immediate needs of the front-line troops preceded any requisitions directed toward supplying German industry.
<br><br>
Industrial requisitions began in Lille on December 4, 1914, with a posted announcement that “all factories and wholesalers of raw materials, and mass produced or manufactured goods have to present . . . an exact list of their provisions.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a>  These owners had just eight days to deliver their lists to the Fortification-Administration [<i>Festungs-Intendantur</i>] in Lille. These lists suggest that the procedure applied to Lyon’s industrialists closely resembled the “sequestrations” Rathenau simultaneously enacted in Germany. Similarly, just as the KRA had passed export bans on “war raw materials,” the same poster in Lille required that any sales to foreigners (non-French) and people residing outside of Lille be approved by the local military authority.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a>  Metal requisitions began sporadically in Lille in the spring of 1915 as part of a larger effort to gain raw materials from local businesses. When a requisition team confiscated cartloads of canvas from the Delesalle textile factory, they also removed copper.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a>  In May, the military governor of Lille posted a decree requiring that undeclared industrial metal stocks “hidden by the population,” if found, would be seized and the person who hid it—and possibly his or her landlord—would be imprisoned, fined, or both.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a>  Denunciations and searches soon followed.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> 
<br><br>
Private household requisitions began in Germany after the establishment of the Metal Mobilization Office in April 1915 and they were a feature of Josef Koeth’s “militarization” of the KRA. The first reference to these requisitions in Lille, however, occurred in early February, during Rathenau’s tenure, and they came not from the KRA or as a military order, but from industry. On February 10, 1915, the <i>Liller Kriegszeitung</i>—a German language paper for the troops of the 6th Army— reprinted sections of an article by Ernst Noah, the co-owner of a foundry that specialized in the processing of scrap metal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a>  Noah’s article had first appeared a month earlier in <i>Die Metallbörse</i> [The Metal Exchange] and had already attracted the attention of the allied and neutral press.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>  Titled “Our Copper Supply,” Noah recapitulated Norbert Levy’s argument that Germany could defy the British blockade by relying on its “scrap metal reserve” of finished goods made of copper—estimated to contain 1.5 million tons. Noah claimed that this reserve consisted of five streams, from the most to least accessible: (1) state depots, including railways and the naval and army administrations (2) spent munitions (3) industrial reserves in occupied territory (4) household copper objects (5) cables from out-of-commission tramway and telephone lines. For the requisitions from occupied territory, Noah acknowledged that “naturally” the owners of these materials wanted to evade these measures—if not for political reasons than for pure economic self-interest, payment would only come at the end of the war and for a price well-below the wartime (black market) value. For household goods, Noah claimed that decorative cookware “in the better households,” as well as wash kettles and the cooking vats used by butchers, represented “significant amounts of copper.” He claimed that in recently occupied Poland the more wealthy homes had such objects “which could be obtained without great effort.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> 
<br><br>
The publication of these arguments in the widely-read <i>Liller Kriegszeitung </i>meant that German soldiers participating in industrial requisitions or household searches may have understood Germany’s need for such material and might confiscate metal objects, regardless of whether they had received direct orders from the KRA to do so.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a>  Even if they had not read the article, the soldiers had already begun to incorporate metal salvage into their routines of trench life—from recovering spent artillery shells to more mundane fare. In early February 1915, the soldiers of the 6th Army had been asked to collect and return all of the food tins and the tin foil chocolate wrappers they received in their parcels from home, in order to counter the effects of the British blockade on tin.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a>  After the summer of 1915, when all German households faced household metal requisitions, German soldiers in occupied France assumed that the same measures would be applied in the occupied territories.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, systematic requisitions of metal objects from households—though they had begun in other districts in the summer and fall of 1915—did not begin in Lille until the late spring and summer of 1916. Requisition teams first targeted the finished goods in public institutions, such as schools or government offices, as well as abandoned homes, particularly those of Lille’s <i>haute bourgeoisie. </i>For example, at the end of May, the Germans removed from one school, “the kitchen utensils, the copper rods securing the rug in the stairway, the ceiling lights, the copper decorative trimming on the umbrella stands, furniture, scales, and weights.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a>  Two weeks later, two German noncommissioned officers accompanied by two conscripted laborers took from an abandoned home “6 copper chandeliers, 1 copper oil lamp, 1 hall lamp, 2 copper kettles, 2 pots, 1 slotted spoon, 1 copper gas heater, 1 tin pot, 1 tin one-liter measuring cup, 1 zinc bathtub, 1 role of iron wire.” The caretaker of the home vainly tried to get a receipt for the objects. When that failed, he sent a list to the mayor to guarantee “for the future” that he had done his utmost to prevent the confiscations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>  In both of these cases, the seized objects contained a mixture of those already confiscated in Germany—like kitchen utensils—with those that had not yet been targeted, such as decorative trimmings and the copper stairwell rods.
<br><br>
Not surprisingly, given their metal needs in the summer of 1916, the Germans primarily sought out tin, and its alloy pewter, in cans, measuring cups, pitchers, vases, faucets, and counter tops from bars, restaurants, hotels, shops, and <i>estaminets</i> (the small café-bars of Belgium and Northern France).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a>  One of the registers used by the German authorities to indicate the name, address, and quantity of each requisitioned business or household, has survived in Lille’s municipal archives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>  Its 63 pages of ordered, handwritten German reveals that starting on May 11, 1916, the soldiers of the First Bavarian Etappen Collection Company proceeded methodically, street by street, business by business, confiscating all the tin objects they could get their hands on. At the end of each day, their supervisor—a German by the name of Merkel—added up the daily tallies, wrote the date, and affixed his official stamp. By July 5, 1916, the collection team had seized 43.64 tons of tin objects from 3189 businesses or households. The seizures ranged in size from a set of measuring spoons weighing 100 grams to 265-kilograms of counter tops taken from the Hotel Royal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> 
<br><br>
Whereas the requisitions in industry and commercial enterprises went relatively smoothly, the intrusion of the German military police into private households met determined resistance. In <i>Lille vergewaltigt?</i>, Herms explained that the required declaration period for household metal objects began in the summer of 1916 but their actual collection did not begin until March 1917—at that time, the German military commander issued a new decree to declare objects, the poster seen by Dujardin in late May 1917. The reason for the delay between declaration and actual collection, Herms claimed, was that the inhabitants of Lille provided the required declaration forms “only in a few cases.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a>  Instead, again according to Herms, they avoided the confiscation degree by hiding their objects “in every conceivable manner.” To understand when, how, and why the population of Lille chose to disobey this decree we need to look more closely at what one memoirist has dubbed the “copper affair.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> 

<br><br><br>
— To Betray or Not to Betray —
<br><br><br>

In his account of life in occupied Lille written in 1919, the Protestant pastor Pierre Bosc devoted an entire chapter to describing how the population of Lille collectively resisted the 1916 decree to declare household metal objects. At the beginning of the chapter, he specifically requested “the historians of the Great War” to “register this as a stunning victory . . . the victory of copper.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a>  By pairing Bosc’s long, but useful, narrative with other contemporary printed and archival sources, Lille’s “copper victory” offers a case study in passive resistance and its opposite—behavior that during the Second World War would be labeled economic collaboration. The variegated ways that the people of Lille responded to these requisitions can stand in for the decisions made by hundreds of thousands of communities throughout occupied Europe.
<br><br>
On July 16, the German occupation authorities in Lille put up white posters requiring—in both German and French—all households to declare and deliver all “objects entirely or principally made of copper, nickel, tin, or alloys of these metals” with exceptions made for objects of religious, artistic, or historical value.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a>  Individuals needed to pick up declaration forms from the Police Commissioner and complete them by mid-August. A supplement to the decree posted on August 15 required that they bring the declaration forms to the <i>Palais Rameau</i>—an exposition hall in the center of the city—between August 25 and 30. At a later (undetermined) date their objects would be confiscated and they would be reimbursed in vouchers worth, per kilogram, 1 to 1.5 francs for brass, 1.2 to 1.75 francs for bronze, 1.5 to 2.5 francs for copper, 3.5 to 5.5 francs for tin, and 4 to 6 francs for nickel. After the mandatory declaration period, the German authorities threatened to carry out household searches and seizures, confiscating all undeclared objects and punishing individuals with prison terms of up to five years or fines of up to 10,000 Marks.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> 
<br><br>
Bosc thought that these metal requisitions were categorically different from the countless requisitions that had preceded them. He illustrated this difference by describing the reaction of the population to the July 1916 decree requiring the declaration of copper objects:

<blockquote>It is easy to understand the profound emotion that this poster produced in the population of our city. The confiscation of wines, liquor, spirits, etc. ordered on March 30, 1916 . . . troubled only the rich owners of well-stocked cellars; the decree concerning the imposition of a tax on dogs, a decree leading to a terrible massacre of pets . . . touched only a small part of the population, the ordinance concerning copper reached everybody. What household, no matter how impoverished, did not count among their possessions some bronze chimney decoration, or some copper vase, chandelier or kettle?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a></blockquote>

Rare indeed was the household without a metal object covered in the decree: curtain rods, hat racks, fireplace pokers, bed frames, lamps, frying pans. The ubiquity of metal objects in everyday life meant that these requisitions affected everybody. According to Bosc, there was a gradual collective awareness that with these requisitions the Germans had drawn a line in the sand, and that each individual had to choose which side they would stand on. In the hushed conversations of men and women gathered in front of the “long white posters” or around their dinner tables, the question was simple: declare or not declare?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> 
<br><br>
A practical response, said some, would be to declare only a portion of the objects and be in compliance, in order to more easily avoid invasive searches that would reveal more. Others, who advocated resistance, saw the decree—in blatant contradiction to the Hague Convention—as a call to “provide ourselves the material for the bullets and shells destined to kill our husbands and our sons.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>  An anonymous pamphlet distributed in Lille sometime after the posting of the decree forcefully advocated the latter position:

<blockquote>This copper, this nickel, this tin that they ask of you, will be used against your own . . . it is as if they gave you the order to take up arms against the soldiers who have struggled and have fallen, for the past two years, for the defense of your property and your liberty. . . . No equivocating discussions! No hypocritical reticence! We are at an hour where we must . . . take a position. . . . To betray or not to betray! that is the question. All patriotism that does not manifest itself in actions is a false patriotism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a></blockquote>

At first, local authorities refused to take a public position. This initial silence created a moral void; Bosc cited one unnamed “eminent man” who gave the “sibylline” advice to “be both prudent and patriotic.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> 
<br><br>
The first to publicly break the silence was Jean-Baptiste Leclercq, the senior member of the Saint-Christopher church in Tourcoing, an industrial city just north of Lille with a particularly devout population. The requisition order was posted in the city on August 11. In his sermon during the high mass the following Sunday, August 13, Leclercq took a firm stand:

<blockquote>Several of my parishioners have come and asked me what should be done on the subject of the latest poster pasted on the walls concerning the requisition of copper, tin, and nickel. If our enemies come by force, in your homes, to take these objects, you cannot oppose them. They have the strength! But if, according to the poster, you declare and go yourselves to carry the utensils destined—nobody denies it—to become the shells and bullets used against your husbands, sons, parents or friends, this, you must not and cannot do; and, no matter what any other local authority might have said, I have believed it is my duty to tell you that what is asked of you in this poster is against natural law, human rights, and the Hague Convention.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a></blockquote>

Two days later Leclercq distributed the text of his sermon to all the clergy of the city. Leclercq paid for his fortitude. By August 18, he was arrested and imprisoned, tried, sentenced by a military tribunal to 10 years in prison, and sent to Germany to serve his time.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a>  According to a document in the German Foreign Ministry, the Germans did not put him to death because, surprisingly, they recognized that Leclerq had acted for “patriotic reasons and out of considerations of conscience” and they may also have feared that harsh treatment of a priest could feed “enemy propaganda.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> 
<br><br>
In the following days, Lille’s highest municipal, departmental, and religious authorities each petitioned the military commander of Lille. The letters of Lille’s mayor and prefect both described the controversy provoked by the poster and cited Articles 46 and 52 of the Hague Convention that prohibited, respectively, the occupier from appropriating private possessions and from forcing civilians to participate in “acts of war against their own country.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a>  The mayor also objected to the requirement that the declarations be picked up at the neighborhood police stations, rather than the German police, because “in the eyes of the population, it implicated the participation of the municipal administration.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a>  The letter of Lille’s bishop, Alexis-Amand Charost, appealed to honor, salvation, and the suffering of mothers and fathers forced to “deliver the engines of war” destined to decimate their children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a>  For each of these protesters, the primary offense was that the requirement of individual declaration, unlike a blanket requisition or forced seizure, compelled civilians—in the words of Lille’s mayor—to “indirectly cooperate” with the enemy’s war effort. Twenty-five years later under the Vichy regime this same behavior would be called economic collaboration.
<br><br>
Bosc and others remembered Leclercq’s call to action, and the protests it provoked, as an explosive event that galvanized society, brought people together, and offered a sense of renewed hope. His description evoked the enthusiastic “sacred union” that accompanied the French declaration of war: “Almost without exception, and with enthusiasm, the partisans of a sensible opportunism rallied to those who refused to compromise . . . Men and women, bourgeois and workers, repeated one after the other: We will not declare. Come what may!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a> 
<br><br>
The reality was more complex. Not all of Lille’s citizens agreed with Leclercq. On the same day as the mayor’s principled protest, a man writing in the name of all “independent and honest inhabitants of Lille” complained about the lack of precision in the German announcement, and requested that the mayor issue a detailed explanation of what exactly should be declared—as he underlined in his letter—in order to “avoid the severe fines.” For example, he asked, “should one declare scales in wrought iron with copper plates and weights? . . . bronze or copper chimney andirons? door knobs?”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a>  The writer particularly worried that “an involuntary omission” might mean that he could face the stiff penalties. Many like him feared the consequences of noncompliance.
<br><br>
Nor did all of those who agreed with Leclercq respond with enthusiasm. The day after the sermon, the school teacher Maria Degrutère described the recent events in her diary: “Poster concerning the seizure of copper, bronze, tin . . . New worry because it will serve for the direct attack on our armies.” She mentioned the opposition of the prefect and mayor, Leclercq’s sermon and sentence, and the decision by the inhabitants of Roubaix, Tourcoing, and Lille not to declare. She concluded with a note of resignation, “We always have new difficulties. A little bit at a time, they strip us of everything we possess. It really wasn’t worth staying in occupied territory to arrive at the same point as those who abandoned everything.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> 
<br><br>
How many acquiesced to German demands and how many actively opposed them? The statistical picture is inconclusive. According to Lille’s police commissioner, between August 23 and August 25, 3170 people (each representing a household) requested declaration forms, with the number varying by district, for example only 6% came from the sixth and seventh districts, while 16% came from the fourth and fifth.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a>  Lille’s population had been 500,000 in 1914 before the war, but dropped to 129,000 by February 1918.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a>  No accurate numbers exist for 1916, and without knowing the average household size, or accounting for the destruction of some of those districts, it is difficult to interpret this figure, especially considering that it only included the number of blank declaration forms picked up, not the amount turned in.
<br><br>
Bosc described the scene that he witnessed on August 25, the day that those with the last names beginning with the letters A through C were required to turn in their forms:

<blockquote> Friday, August 25, around 10:00 in the morning, I passed in front of the <i>Palais Rameau</i> where the German authorities had decided to collect the declaration forms. . . . In front of the monumental gate of this edifice were stationed several German military police. At the entry gate, one or two French municipal police officers . . . Facing the entrance, sitting on a bench on the Boulevard Vauban, some undecided individuals, declaration forms in pocket . . . From time to time one of them would cross the threshold of the <i>Palais Rameau</i>; he would come out several minutes later, slightly uncomfortable and curiously frowned upon by the passersby. In five days there were only 150 to 200 declarations for the entire city.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a></blockquote>

Though his numbers cannot be confirmed, diaries and other postwar accounts suggest that many refused to declare and actively hid objects.
<br><br>
The citizens of Lille stashed objects below floorboards and within their walls, they buried them in the garden or threw them in nearby rivers or streams, and they transported them to churches and neighboring houses in suspiciously heavy sacks or in piles of laundry.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a>  Bosc recalled one memorable example from a September 1916 evening:
<blockquote>
An entire family, grouped around the gaping opening of a well, was getting ready to hide their larger objects there. One of them, with an agile hand, spread Vaseline on the surfaces to preserve them as much as possible from oxidation. Another attached a solid hook to the end of a long, solid hemp rope. A third, armed with a shuttered lantern, lit this tragi-comic scene. Two or three ladies, with worried expressions, prudently held the coattails of one man who was leaning over the large opening to judge the depth.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a></blockquote>

Some of these activities took place in broad daylight. One particularly clever disabled man discovered that the safest way to transport his bags of copper in the tramway cars was to sit next to a German soldier, point out both the heavy bag and his disability, and then place the bag on the obliging soldier’s lap, where it remained safe from any police inspection.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> 
<br><br>
Not everybody who refused to declare could hide their metal. Bosc pointed out that wealthy individuals—such as Dujardin—often had an abundance of these objects, making them difficult to effectively hide. They also frequently billeted German soldiers already familiar with the contents of their homes. In this case, they had to sacrifice their objects, whether they filled out a declaration or not.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a>  This happened to 70-year-old Oscar Fanyau, the former mayor of Helemmes, a suburb of Lille. After he refused to fill out a declaration, his home, which had housed German officers since the beginning of the war, was searched and he was arrested. Because of his position, the Germans decided to make an example of him. They first asked him to publicly declare his bronze and copper objects, which he refused. On October 23, Fanyau explained his position in a respectful letter to the military commander of Hellemmes:
<blockquote>
Very sincerely, I will tell you that, if I did not declare the metals . . . It’s because of my conscience has prevented it. Do not see my abstention as a refusal to obey nor a lack of respect for the German [Military] Authority, but do not ask me, a Frenchman, who has honorably served his country as an officer, to declare and deliver metal to produce the projectiles destined to kill my brothers; this would be contrary to my honor and to my patriotism. Take these metals, the German [Military] Authority knows the copper and bronze [objects] that have been in my house, for two years, in sight of the numerous officers and soldiers who have lodged in my home. They have, in addition, already been consigned twice, in October 1915 by a noncommissioned officer and lastly, August 31, by two gendarmes who visited my home.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a></blockquote>
They then sentenced him to three months of imprisonment in the Citadelle of Lille. An hour after his arrival on October 30 Fanyau suffered a heart attack and died.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> 
<br><br>
This somber note is a fitting end to Bosc’s story of “copper victory.” It would be, at most, a Pyrrhic victory. At the end of September, a new poster appeared in Lille “concerning the declaration of objects for the needs of war” that gave a grace period until mid-November for individuals who had not yet declared their vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, rubber, cooking oil, lard, cotton, linen, wool, hemp, thread, leather, saddles, used copper wiring and copper, nickel, tin, led, bronze, and brass objects.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a>  On seeing this, Maria Degrutère noted that “in this way, the country will soon be sucked dry.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> 

<br><br><br>
— The Spiral of Extremity —
<br><br><br>

On March 11, 1917, the newspaper editor Eugène Martin-Mamy described his encounter with the latest posted decree: 
<blockquote>
Each morning, when we leave our houses, we’ve gotten into the habit of looking at the walls first. It’s a reflex. Every day the wall announces a new theft by the occupier. The population not having obeyed the injunction that had been made recently to deliver the copper, nickel, and other metals, the governor made it known to us that they are going to come take them from our homes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a></blockquote>

That decree—issued on March 8—indicated that the military police would collect all the objects that had been declared in Lille, and, further, suggested that individuals put all the objects in one place, identify large items or those that needed to be removed, and open all cupboards, to avoid unnecessary (and potentially destructive) searches. The decree also eliminated the protections for historic, artistic or religious objects, instead offering the option of labeling the object with a cardboard sign indicating its value.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> 
<br><br>
In <i>Lille vergewaltigt?</i>, Herms marked this moment as the real beginning of the copper metal collection in Lille. He began his account by citing a postwar radio interview given by the French member of the Chamber of Deputies who claimed that “Everything was looted, everything was stolen, brass, bronze, furniture, the household searches laid waste to everything. Furnished with permission slips, the armed bandits invaded the houses, smashed the furniture and closets [and] broke up the floors and the ceilings in order to find what they sought.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>  Objecting to this characterization, Herms argued that the violence—which he did not deny—had been caused by French unwillingness to cooperate and that the household searches had been carried out with the complicity and active support of French authorities and workers. Furthermore, Herms pointed out that German military commanders gave monetary incentives to German troops for any collected metal. He believed that troops who saw this “collecting activity as profitable employment” were responsible for the destruction of objects “whose value was not in proportion to the damage caused.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a>  Both French and German sources agree that in the spring of 1917 the relatively organized, systematic pillage of occupied Lille became increasingly violent and destructive.
<br><br>
Household searches, though announced in March 1917, had actually begun the previous fall, often following denunciations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a>  The copper thieves were thorough. Degrutère described how a French gendarme and a German soldier searched a neighbor’s house, “top to bottom” and found a lead pipe in the attic, two electric light fixtures, a belt buckle, and some buttons on a soldier’s uniform.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a>  The next day, two Germans ransacked her own house, “attic, cellar, laundry room, on top and underneath the furniture . . . even in the coal pile and water tank” and took a small copper kettle and a broken heat fixture.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a>  Degrutère’s mother received a 5 mark fine for the undeclared objects, but was luckier than most of her neighbors, who had fines ranging from 20 to 150 marks for hiding copper.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a>  Requisitions like these continued throughout the winter and spring. David Hirsch, a Jewish business owner in Roubaix, described how in late December, groups of Germans, often early in the morning, scoured every “nook and cranny” of the houses and businesses with flashlights, removing electric lamps, small bronze statues, kitchen utensils, chandeliers, and even musical instruments.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> 
<br><br>
Despite strategies like using architectural floor plans to discover secret rooms, sounding gardens with long metal rods, or draining ponds and rivers, the Germans had more and more difficulty gaining significant amounts of metal from each search over the winter and spring of 1917.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a>  Either households had already had most of their possessions requisitioned or they had successfully hidden them. A renewed series of systematic tin requisitions from late February through April brought in only five tons, with the average confiscation per household at just under five kilograms, much less than the earlier effort in the summer of 1916.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> 
<br><br>
The posting of the March 8, 1917, decree announcing household searches, spurred more of Lille’s inhabitants to hide their metal objects. “So there’s a feverish activity in each house,” wrote Martin-Mamy in his diary on March 11, “[u]nder the boards, in the walls, between the bedsprings, we hide all kinds of objects.” Martin-Mamy then described an encounter in the street that he had with “a nice man” who had just hidden his copper in a cemetery: “Armed with a small shovel that he holds tightly under his overcoat, he dug a hole between two graves and buried his pots there. ‘No way,’ he told me, ‘am I going to give them what they need to make shells to kill my son who’s at the front.’”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a>  People may have hidden metal for less noble motives than resistance to the Germans—such as holding on to material to resell it on the black market—but, as this conversation suggests, most justified such activity in terms similar to those raised in August 1916 by Leclercq, Charost, Delesalle, and Fanyau.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a>

The specifications in the March 8 decree designed to facilitate the removals also suggest that the Germans did not have enough manpower to do the job.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a>  Indeed, immediately after posting the decree, the German military commander required the city government to provide French police and workers to assist in the household seizures. On March 9, the German chief of military police told his French counterpart that the Germans needed twenty-seven French employees: three clerks from city hall to receive the objects and process the requisition slips; eight locksmiths to open and close locked properties, apartments, cupboards and wardrobes; and sixteen municipal police officers to maintain order while the German teams requisitioned the objects. He also gave the mayor the option of providing an expert who could evaluate the historical or artistic value of objects, and record it, though it would not prevent the object from being seized. Not surprisingly, the mayor had some difficulty finding somebody to fill this post.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a>  The General Secretary of Museums denied the mayor’s request, blaming the “detrimental state” of his vision.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a>  French participation did not go unnoticed; observers like Maria Degrutère and David Hirsch frequently noted the participation of French police in the seizures.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a>  Herms, too, corroborated some of these details, saying that each of the requisition teams had one French police officer as well as one French locksmith.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> 
<br><br>
In May 1917, the military commander of Lille issued a decree on the “exploitation of raw materials and other objects serving the war effort” listing 31 categories of raw materials.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a>  This was the poster that Dujardin saw in late May or early June and that inspired his poem, “A la Wirtschaftsausschluss.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a>  The copper theft that followed, however, resulted from a separate ordinance on June 14, 1917, that covered nearly all conceivable metallic objects in a household. Under its first clause it provided a list of hundreds of things that could be seized; besides the usual pots, pans, and coffee grinders, the list including door knobs, locks, and knockers; coat hooks from closets; and the metal letters and numbers that indicated apartment numbers or addresses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a>  The objects targeted in this measure matched those in a decree issued a week later in Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a>  As evidence of the additional powers of the War Office, created in the fall of 1916, this measure was the first to be applied uniformly in both occupied Belgium and France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">[100]</a>  The requisition of aluminum objects followed just two weeks later, again enacting policy in place in Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">[101]</a>  Degrutère took heart in the fact that the Germans were reduced to such trivial objects like “coat racks, decorations on pianos, door handles”; Hirsch saw the long list of objects from the June 1917 decrees as proof that “they must really have a metal shortage in Germany.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[102]</a> 
<br><br>
The June 14 decree also introduced collective, rather than individual responsibility. It required mayors to collect the declarations of these objects by July 1 and give them to the local military authority by July 5. Unlike previous ordinances, the penalty for disobeying included collective punishments. The last line of the ordinance stated: “The authorities reserve the right, in addition, to impose large fines on municipalities in which the confiscation will have encountered difficulties for any reason.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[103]</a>  Not surprisingly, local mayors complied. In Flers, a small town just east of Lille, a register kept in city hall revealed 97 declarations of objects that ranged in weight from a few grams to several kilograms including lamps, cooking pots, a car headlight, and a hearth fire-guard.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[104]</a> 
<br><br>
In June the “copper thieves” took Dujardin’s bronze statues and Martin-Mamy’s curtain rods.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">[105]</a>  By the end of the summer, they began tearing out copper telephone and telegraph wires, light fixtures, water heaters, and copper roofs.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">[106]</a>  In September, they visited Maria Degrutère’s home a second time, where the search “happened normally,” but they ransacked David Hirsch’s shop. Hirsch described how at “8:00am, a team searching for copper took the chandeliers, the feet of the piano, 4 gas heaters” and two hours later “3 Germans and 2 Belgians or French . . . civilians” came to remove the rest of his store’s inventory.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">[107]</a> 
<br><br>
French officials protested one more time. The prefect cited abuses against Article 52 of the Hague Convention, and the mayor of Lille protested the removal of light fixtures and artistic works whose value was “8 or 10 times, if not more, the value of their weight in metal.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-108">[108]</a>  In his response, the military commander of Lille, von Graevenitz, cited the Hague Convention’s stipulation that permitted “the confiscation of objects necessary for war” and, as proof of this necessity, stated that because of the ban on German trade with neutral countries, “even in Germany, objects made of copper, etc., have been seized in broad scope.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-109">[109]</a>  That the language used by Von Graevenitz was nearly identical to the postwar defense of Herms suggests that most Germans involved in requisitions justified their activities as a “military necessity” provoked by an illegal British blockade.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-110">[110]</a> 
<br><br>
Despite his protests, the mayor of Lille acquiesced to German demands. He hired laborers from Gaz de Wazemmes to process the metal. Instead of resisting the offer, the company provided more men than asked for and worked longer hours than required.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-111">[111]</a>  The owner of the company that would melt it down—Louis Haas in Magdeburg, Germany—also ordered the mayor to send “a man to note the property owners and weight of the metal for each household” as they loaded it to be shipped to his company. Haas told the mayor that this directive came from the “surveillance officer” of the regional KRA section.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-112">[112]</a> 
<br><br>
Alongside these administrative protests, church leaders spoke out against the metal requisitions from churches that had begun to be applied more rigorously.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-113">[113]</a>  After the Germans removed bells and organ pipes from churches in Wavrin, Tressin, Ascq, Lomme, and Flers in late February 1917, they ordered the priests of Tourcoing and Lille to compile an inventory of their metal objects. When Lille’s bishop, Charost, learned of this order, he told his priests to disobey and then wrote to the military commander to register his “solemn and energetic protest.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-114">[114]</a>  He outlined the reasons for his refusal. At his consecration, Charost had sworn publicly to protect the church’s property, and a church’s bells were among its most sacred possessions: they received the sacrament of baptism, which included a name and godparents; they received sacred unction; and they had undeniable artistic and historical value, as many had survived the depredations of the Wars of Religion and the French Revolution.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-115">[115]</a>  Finally, church bells unambiguously fell under the protection of Article 56 of the Hague Convention.
<br><br>
The priests of Tourcoing followed Charost’s injunction and refused the order.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-116">[116]</a>  The Germans arrested them and gave them a choice between paying a 200 mark fine or 20 days in prison; the priests chose imprisonment—which happened to fall during the week of Easter.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-117">[117]</a>  At the beginning of April, the Germans removed the bells from two churches in Marcq, a suburb of Lille.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-118">[118]</a>  When the occupation authorities asked Charost to deconsecrate the bells so that “religious Germans could remove the bells without committing a sacrilege,” naturally, he “vehemently and patriotically” refused.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-119">[119]</a> 
<br><br>
Another form of sacrilege was the violent searches of churches, chapels, and convents in order to find hidden goods.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-120">[120]</a>  “Searches all day long in all the churches of the occupied territory,” wrote Maria Degrutère on November 17, 1917, “not even the smallest corner is left unexplored by the shovels, picks, mattocks, [and] lanterns.” Alluding to the destruction of Church property during the French Revolution, Degrutère described it as a “regime of terror.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-121">[121]</a> 
<br><br>
From February through May, 1918, the “copper thieves” went after copper and brass bed frames (the mattresses had been seized earlier).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-122">[122]</a>  From Lille’s factories, they systematically tore out the copper, lead, tin, and nickel parts from electric machinery, including machine tools and spinning mills.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-123">[123]</a>  They requisitioned all the bronze helmets of the Fire Brigade and replaced them with bullet-riddled ones scavenged from the corpses of French soldiers; in some cases, these helmets still contained grisly remnants of their former owners.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-124">[124]</a>  In March they emptied the streets, first by “decapitating the bronze street lamps”—as they were doing simultaneously in Belgium—then by tearing down any remaining copper telegraph and telephone wires, and finally by removing the public statuary.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-125">[125]</a> 
<br><br>
On April 7, Dujardin memorialized in verse Lille’s statues still standing in April 1918: Napoleon, Joan of Arc, the composer Desrousseaux, the Generals Négrier and Faidherbe, and the prefects Pierre Legrand and Armand-Achille Testelin. He offered a prayer on their behalf: “Preserve them, Lord . . . / let all of our copper heroes survive! Take pity on their fate. / Save them from the foundry, / spare them the shame / of a second death…”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-126">[126]</a>  His prayer went unanswered. Three days later German soldiers tore down the Testelin bronze and cut it up with a blowtorch, leaving its dismembered limbs in the Place de Strasbourg.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-127">[127]</a>  Joan of Arc followed, which provoked the wry observation, “after half a millennium, and with the help of the Germans, the Virgin will once again run down the English, but this time in the form of shrapnel.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-128">[128]</a>  By May 1918 the Germans had removed nearly all of Lille’s statues.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-129">[129]</a> 

<br><br><br>
— Conclusion —
<br><br><br>

Lille’s experience of metal requisitions was not exceptional for occupied northern France. Diarists in Laon, Cambrai, and Charleville described nearly the same pattern of requisitions—though the actual timing would vary widely—and similar responses: the haphazard military pillaging, the organized industrial requisitions, the private household requisitions, the declarations, the decision to declare or not, the fear of those who did, the furtive activities of those who did not, the methodical violence of searches and seizures, the desecration of sacred and public space.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-130">[130]</a> 
<br><br>
In each of these cases, the turning point—the line drawn in the sand—was the moment of private, household requisitions and the decision whether to participate or not. Those who participated did so out of fear, financial gain, or both. Those who refused did so out of patriotism, unwillingness to part with possessions, or both. The Hague Convention and the Catholic Church provided guidelines for behavior, but in both cases, they were unable to prevent the seizures. Systematic requisitions were seen as evidence of both German barbarism and German weakness. The same requisitions, decisions, and observations occurred in hundreds of thousands of communities in occupied Europe during the First World War and left powerful memories.
<br><br>
Alfred Dujardin’s bronze statues and treasured basins and coffee maker joined the 500,000 tons of scrap copper processed by Belgian foundries during the First World War.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-131">[131]</a>  Though Dujardin would not live to see it, from 1940 to 1944 his descendants in Lille again participated in scrap metal and mobilization drives. They would be asked once again “to declare or not to declare” in the fall of 1941, but it would be in a very different context: though the metal would once again go to Germany, the “copper thieves” would be French.

Notes
<br><br>
1  Dujardin, <i>Lille Captive</i>, 139-140, 175-76; Archives Municipales de Lille (AM-Lille), 4H 143, Poster, Otto Von Below, “Ordonnance sur l’exploitation des matières premières et autres objets servant à la guerre dans la région française occupée par la 6ème armée,” May 9, 1917. For the date of this encounter, Dujardin simply wrote “June 1917.” He accurately described the text of a poster contained in Lille’s municipal archives which was posted in Lille on May 9, 1917, and announced in the <i>Bulletin de Lille</i> (no. 267) on June 3, 1917. Yet this poster was pink, not green. Dujardin included details suggesting that the newly-applied poster he saw was the green supplement added to the bottom of the original poster after May 29, 1917. For this detail see the handwritten register of the First World War poster collection: AM-Lille 4H, “Affiches posées à Lille pendant l’Occupation Allemande,” page 22.<br><br>
2 Dujardin, “A la Wirtschaftsausschluss, June 1917,” <i>Lille Captive</i>, 139-140. The name of the economic office was <i>Wirtschaftsausschuss</i> (“economic commission”), the word “<i>Wirtschaftsauschluss</i>” could be translated as “economic elimination or expulsion,” perhaps a more fitting title. <br><br>
3 Dujardin, “Adieu mes bronzes, June 1917,” <i>Lille Captive</i>, 142, 144. The other two statues, reproductions of the<i> Diana of Gabies </i>and Jean de Bologne’s <i>Mercury</i>, had less sentimental value, but he treasured their artistic worth. Dujardin was not exaggerating about his sad widowhood. Born in 1849, Dujardin married in 1876, and his wife died in 1896, leaving him to care for their three young children. He never remarried. See the family tree created by Marie Therese Tharinat http://gw.geneanet.org/mtharin?lang=fr&p=alfred+ auguste&n=dujardin.

9 I draw here on the work of James Connolly, who has proposed new categories for understanding behavior in occupied France during the First World War. Rather than the term “collaboration,” he proposes a phrase used by contemporaries: “la mauvaise conduite,” or “bad behavior.” See in particular, James Edward Connolly, “<i>Mauvaise conduite: </i>complicity and respectability in the occupied Nord, 1914-1918,” <i>First World War Studies </i>4, no. 1 (2013). <br><br>

52 AM-Lille, 4H 161, “Ordonnance concernant la consignation d’articles de ménage et d’installation fabriqués de cuivre, de nickel et d’étain” 16 July 1916 and “Supplement Explicatif pour la Ville de Lille” August 15, 1916, both were reprinted as “Actes de l’autorité allemande,” <i>Bulletin de Lille</i>, no. 186, August 24, 1916, available on the Project Gutenberg EBook of the Bulletin de Lille, http://eremita.di.uminho.pt/gutenberg/2/6/7/1/26712/26712-h/26712-h.htm, last updated September 27, 2008. The maximum fine was identical to the punishment in Germany, though the prison term was much harsher, five years instead of 6 months. Though not exactly proportional, the prices offered for the metals also roughly corresponded to the range in prices given in Germany, with the copper always being the least valuable and nickel the most valuable.<br><br>

Connolly uses this letter to illustrate what he describes as the “respectable resistance” of many French authorities. Fanyau’s action has a performative dimension, he is more interested in the refusal and its grounds, than whether or not the metal goes to the Germans.
