	case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<p><b> William Russell Bascom </b> (1912-1981) was an American anthropologist who received considerable recognition for his study in African folklore, art, and ethnography [1]. His <i> Ifa Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa </i> (1969) is considered to be his best work and Bunche won the Pitre International Folklore Prize [2]. During his first field work in Nigeria (1937-38), he started to collect Yoruba proverbs and continued to study them with his wife, Berta Bascom, a Cuban-born folklorist. [3] In Nigeria, she worked with English speaking Yoruba informants to translate the proverbs, find out the social contexts and their meanings [4]. Around the time he obtained his PhD under Melville J. Herksovits in 1939 at Northwestern University [5] , WWII broke out and Bascom was sent to West Africa for government service (1943-46). [6] He joined the OSS and later worked with the Board of Economic Warfare as Chief of the French West African Section [7] , which is when he co-authored <i> A Pocket Guide to West Africa </i> with Ralph Bunche. </p> <p> <b> Ralph Johnson Bunche </b> (1903-1971), an African American scholar, civil rights activist, political scientist and diplomat became the first African-American to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. [8] Bunche was very interested in racial relations- in his book <i> A World View of Race </i> (1936) he primarily focused on the “status of Negroes” in the US and how discrimination was not an issue of ethnicity but social class [9]. In the advent of WWII (1941), Bunche joined the COI as a senior analyst specializing in African affairs and in 1943, moved to the OSS Research and Analysis Branch as an analyst and chief of the Africa division. He was often confronted by policymakers about Africa’s stability and the Axis. [10] </p><p><b>References</b><sup>1</sup> 1“William R.

	IN West Africa you will be playing an important role in the world-wide strategy to smash Hitler and the Axis. On Africa’s West Coast you will be guarding vital supply lines to North Africa, Egypt, India, Russia, and even China. From this region must come much needed strategic materials for our own war machine and for all of the United Nations. The Nazis have been waiting for the chance to execute their elaborate plans for the exploitation of Africa’s vast resources and labor supply. Your presence in West Africa means that these plans have been put on ice. Thus you are striking a hard blow at Hitler, and Hirohito, too. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Before the war not many Americans visited West Africa. But America was well-known there for American goods are popular. Educated West Africans have long stressed the liberality of American ideals and policies. Ordinarily, all white persons in Africa are described as “Europeans”. But the term “American” has a special meaning there, and in your uniforms you will be quickly identified as “Americans,” or, as some native peoples will pronounce it, “ ’mericans.” Many West Africans know the story of the independent Negro Republic of Liberia and America’s role in creating it. In their minds Americans symbolize friendliness and a square deal.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Except for men in uniform you will see few white faces in West Africa. There are practically no white settlers and most of the white men are government officials, traders, or missionaries; there are few white women. The whites are concentrated mainly in the few coastal towns, such as Dakar, Accra, Takoradi, and Lagos. The population is almost completely African and varies in color from jet black to golden brown. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	West Africa may seem strange to you at first, but you will soon find it easy to feel at home. Both the Europeans (these will be mainly English and French) and the Africans like and respect America and Americans. They will be very friendly to you and will expect in return only that you respect them and their way of doing things. Good will toward America is a valuable asset and you will want to protect it. You will understand that not only you as an individual but also your nation will be judged by how <i>you</i> act and what <i>you</i> say. Even this brief introduction to West Africa, its people, and customs may aid you in avoiding anything that might stir up suspicion or even hatred of Americans- and thus serve Hitler’s cause. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	YOU probably haven’t had a chance to learn very much about West Africa except as Hollywood pictures it. There are no men like Tarzan there and no Tarzan mates in leopard skins. You probably won’t see any steaming jungles, or herd of wild animals either; and certainly no naked cannibals. You may hear some African drums at night- beaten at some African ceremony or at an African dance. You will find the rhythm, especially the off-beat, rather familiar – that is if you’re a jitterbug. In towns you may even find Africans fox-trotting and waltzing to phonograph music or to African jazz bands. Towns like Lagos have African dance halls and Dakar has night clubs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But, on the whole, West Africa is really a very quiet, peaceful farming country, with great stretches of uncultivated land. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	West Africans are not savages, nor are they naked – though outside of the towns many of them don’t wear much. You will have nothing to fear from the people during either day or night. They will be pleasant and cooperative, though a bit shy outside the towns, unless you give them cause to be otherwise. In West Africa, as in the United States, a tip (or “dash” as the Africans call it) will help when you want something done.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The point is, of course, that though darker than most peoples you know, and differing considerably in the way they eat, dress, and live, the West Africans are pretty much like people all over the world. In town, there are officials, clerks, artisans, laborers, and hired help; in the countryside, peasant farmers. They marry, raise families, drink the native brews, enjoy their ceremonies and parties, react to hardships as you do. Like white folks the West Africans have upper and lower classes and it would be a serious mistake to assume that all Africans are alike or that they all think and act alike. You will notice a marked difference, for instance, between the Africans of the towns who have adopted many customs of the white man and the relatively primitive Africans of the country. The former are usually described as “detribalized” meaning that they have broken away from the ties and customs that bound them to their tribal society. They no longer serve their tribal chiefs, and are less devoted to their tribal religion than their ancestors were. Many of them are well-educated. Some hold college and professional degrees from universities in Europe and the United States. Many have been converted to Christianity and live in their bungalows and have gardens just as you do at home. They have their own newspapers, churches, forums, political organizations, labor unions, social and athletic clubs.
	</p
	
	<p>
	On the other hand, the African of the country is a farmer whose main interest is to get enough out of the land for his family to live on. He usually follows the customs and religions of his tribe. He is uneducated <i>but not unwise</i>His women and children work hard in the field, and it is usually his wife who brings the spare produce to the markets on regular days.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	Africans are no lazier than other people in tropical climates. They can and will work hard when necessary. Their codes of right and wrong and their religions differ from our own, but they are neither loose nor irreligious. They take their religions seriously. Don’t belittle their gods; don’t call them heathens. Their gods are as real to them as ours is to us.
	</p<
	
	
	
	<p>
	All along the West Coast of Africa, and especially in the British territories, there are groups of educated young Africans who are very proud of their race and their country. They are somewhat more sensitive to slurs and insults than others; it’s best not to discuss political issues with them. They look with hope on the future and expect a new deal after the war. The educated West Africans are fully aware of the Hitler’s designs on Africa and the Nazi scorn for the black people. They know of the false Nazi theory of “master” and “slave” races. they are vigorously anti-Hitler. While many of them also hold grievances and suspicions, some just and some unjust, against their present white rules, you – don’t forget-you– are <i>not</i> going to West Africa to settle internal problems. When such subjects arise, listen – and say nothing. You won’t be well-enough informed to discuss these problems anyway, and you are bound to offend someone if you do. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You will serve our cause best by doing everything possible to get and hold the friendship of both Africans and Europeans in West Africa. All of you will have to be good diplomats as well as good soldiers. Remember that the educated African of the town is even more sensitive about racial issues than the American Negro, and admires dignity and reserve.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Though apparently plain, simple, and trusting, the uneducated African is nobody’s fool. You will find him shrewd in sizing up character and personality, and resourceful in dealing with people. As many of the West Africans are <i>Moslems</i>, they follow the religion known as <i>Islan</i>. This was found by the Arab prophet Mohammed 1,300 years ago was brought to Africa by the Arabs. The Moslems, who can usually be identified in white gowns, believe in one God as we do. But Moslems scorn Christians and Jews because they do not accept the prophet Mohammed. They look down even more scornfully on those West Africans who cling to their tribal religions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The two most numerous Moslem groups in West Africa are the Hausa and Mandingo. The populations of the large trading towns of Northern Nigeria and the French Soudan are almost entirely Moslem. The teachings of Islam, modified by African beliefs, have greatly influenced the social and political life of these communities. Islam emphasized the equality of all races and men and this appeals to the African. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Moslems in their fezzes and gowns are usually better clothed than any but the educated Africans of the towns, although their women do not veil their faces. Moslems of the Mandingo and Hausa tribes travel all over West Africa as traders, missionaries and magicians. The traders are shrewd and always ask a price several times higher than they expect to get. When they have reached their bottom price, however, they can't be budged. They make and sell those small leather packets which you see hanging from the necks of many West Africans. These packets contain written verses from the Koran — the sacred book of Islam — and are believed to protect the wearer from harm. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Hundreds of West Africans are converted to Islam each year. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	West African Moslems, as a rule, are prouder and more independent than other West Africans. They are also particular. In dealing with them you should observe certain rules. Never offer them pork or any products of the pig, for their religion teaches that the pig is an un- clean animal. They must not be interrupted when they are praying to Allah. For one month each year — the month of the Moslem fast of neither Ramadan— many Moslems will neither eat nor drink between dawn and sunset. Do not try to get them to break this fast. They may be tired and irritable during this period and it will be wise to go 
	easy. (In 1943, the fast will begin September 1; in 1944 on August 20.) Where there are enough Moslems in a community there you will find a mosque. This is their church and they are very touchy about it. Never enter a mosque unless a Moslem asks you to go in with him, and, when you do, be sure to take off your shoes. Don't loiter about a mosque; don't try to peek inside. You may run across groups of Moslems reading the Koran and glorifying Allah with chanting and drumming. Don't get too near; don't laugh; don't try to take pictures, or you may have to defend yourself against an angry mob. 
	They take their religion very seriously. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Europeans in West Africa are like the Englishmen and Frenchmen you might meet anywhere. Some of their customs are different from ours but not radically so. You will find, perhaps, that the English don't go about their work with our usual hustle and bustle. But they have a habit of getting their work done. They are cool and have a tough job on their hands in West Africa. The French, as you know, have had particularly hard sledding, and the Frenchmen in West Africa have suffered greatly. They are on our side and if treated with consideration, they will be of great service to our common cause. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	AFRICA isn't much good to anyone without the Africans. They load and unload the ships; they are building airfields and roads, and improving harbors; they drive trucks (or "lorries" as they are called in British West Africa); row surfboats across dangerous sand bars; work in fields, railroads, and in office and kitchen. Africans produce food, for themselves and for you. They will probably build the barracks you live in out of the lumber or the bricks they have made. They gather rubber, produce vegetable oils, and mine the tin, manganese, and chrome we need so badly for the war. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The African has also given his blood and life as a fighter in the common struggle. British West African troops fought valiantly in the Ethiopian campaign. The French Senegalese have had a long and distinguished record as fearless combat troops and are now fighting with us in North Africa. The West Africans are our allies and will help us on to victory. 
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
	The educated African knows that Hitler despises him. He has heard of the Atlantic Charter and the Four Freedoms and knows that the United States considers men as equal. The African is valuable to us as a friend; useless or even dangerous as an enemy. Race prejudice against the African or against American Negro troops in Africa would be a good way to turn the African against us. Everyone is entitled to his own prejudices but it would be only sensible for those who have them to keep them under cover when such high stakes as the war and men's lives are on the table. None of us wants to aid Hitler. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	THIS guide cannot tell you the special taboos (Don't Do's) and customs of the area where you will be stationed. It won't be hard to learn these yourself at first hand if you keep an open mind and a sympathetic attitude. An intelligent and respectful interest in local customs will help you a lot in making friends with the Africans. You will find them interested in how we live in America, and ready to respect our customs even though these may seem curious to them. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When you deal with Africans, it is important to understand two facts about the way their life is organized. First, family ties and obligations involve much larger groups of relatives than what we mean by a "family." These ties may cause a man to turn down a good job out-of-town, even when he could take his own wives and children with him. Second, the eldest man and woman usually act as head of their group. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It is important to work through these customary and accepted channels. This means dealing with the chiefs, elders and family heads, and gaining the friendship of the priests, medicine men, and other influential people. All payments and "dashes" or tips to influential Africans should be made through your interpreter or guide. They are not customarily handed to such persons directly. But make certain that the money gets in the right pocket. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Social position is very important. The order in which people are seated and food is served depends on rank. The more accurately you observe these customs, the better you will get along. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Africans are highly critical of individual behavior. In their own society, chiefs and elders are expected to behave with the dignity befitting their position; if they degrade themselves in any way, they lose the respect of their followers. Africans do not respect anyone who does not respect himself. The same severe standards of judgment will be applied to you. If you are loud or excessively hearty, if you get drunk in public or behave badly, if you associate with loose women or other people who are looked down upon, you will forfeit the esteem that would normally be accorded to you as a foreigner. Treat an African with some formality. Many Africans dislike horseplay and backslapping. They like to shake hands. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Africans have a keen sense of justice. They will accept criticism if they have done wrong, but be absolutely sure that <i>you</i> are not the one who is making the mistake. Never act simply on suspicion. Never discipline an African in front of others. Public shame is one thing he will not forgive. 
	
	<p>
	Africans are polite and put great emphasis on proper forms of etiquette. Their languages contain different forms of greetings for different situations. For example, you use different forms to a person who is working, walking, or at home. In some tribes it takes a good 5 minutes to say "hello" politely. Our traditional American abruptness may shock them at first. If you learn to use even one or two of these greetings and responses correctly, the people will like it. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The main thing, however, is the <i>spirit</i> of courtesy and politeness. If you show this, the Africans will understand and forgive mistakes you may make through not knowing their customs. If you show that you really want to be friendly, you'll get along.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	AVOID all political arguments in West Africa, whether with English, French, or Africans. Don't discuss confidential information if you have any. Remember, there are always ears listening. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Be friendly and polite to the local inhabitants. This will pay you dividends. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember that the African, though his skin is black and his ways strange to you, is a sensitive and intelligent individual and will bitterly resent slurs against his race, tribe, or country. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember that the African is in his own country, on his own land, and that you are a guest and must conduct yourself accordingly. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Do not be overimpatient about the slow tempo of work in West Africa. Neither Europeans nor Africans there have been accustomed to American speed and will have to adjust themselves to it gradually. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember that there are many educated Africans who will resent being treated without respect. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Don't brag about American accomplishments in the war. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Show a decent respect for African customs, religious beliefs, and practices and never wisecrack about them. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Stay away from Moslem mosques and Moslem meetings. In fact, it will be wise to avoid all sacred places and meetings unless you are specially invited. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Never hit an African, never swear at him, never punish him. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Avoid any expressions of race prejudice, 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Africans wish to be called "Africans" or by their tribal names. They do not like the term "native" and are unfamiliar with "Negro."
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	While many Africans do not like to be pointed at or greeted with the left hand (which they use for calls of nature), they will overlook such acts on your part if you are friendly and tolerant.

	You may cause trouble for yourself if you try to be too familiar with West Africans before you know them well. They are not accustomed to back-slapping, but they do like to shake hands. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Keep it in mind that when an African calls you "Massa" (master) he usually hopes to get something from you.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Africans are a generous people and will appreciate generosity on your part, especially with regard to cigarettes and candy. Razor blades are coveted and mirrors are a luxury. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Tipping is an established custom in West Africa and small tips ("dashes") will pay dividends when you want favors done. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember that the African women and girls who are not bashful are certain to be unclean. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	African women, like women everywhere, should be treated with respect; they have husbands and sweethearts who will resent your meddling with them. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you can pick up a few words in the local African tongue, it will help you to get on well with the people. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Don't make the error of thinking of the African as a savage or a child. He thinks and reacts to things just as you do. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Remember that on foreign soil you are the representative of your country.
