CHAPTER 1<br>
<br>
<i>Hills, Valleys, and States: An Introduction to Zomia</i><br>
<br>
I open with three diagnostic expressions of frustration. The first two are
from would-be conquering administrators, determined to subdue a recalcitrant
landscape and its fugitive, resistant inhabitants. The third,
from a different continent, is, from a would-be conqueror of souls, in
some despair at the irreligion and heterodoxy that the landscape appears to
encourage:

<blockquote>Making maps is hard, but mapping Guizhou province especially so. . . . The
land in southern Guizhou has fragmented and confused boundaries. . . . A department
or a county may be split into several subsections, in many instances
separated by other departments or counties. . . . There are also regions of no
man’s land where the Miao live intermixed with the Chinese. . . .
Southern Guizhou has a multitude of mountain peaks. They are jumbled
together, without any plains or marshes to space them out, or rivers or water
courses to put limits to them. They are vexingly numerous and ill-disciplined. . . . 
Very few people dwell among them, and generally the peaks do not have
names. Their configurations are difficult to discern clearly, ridges and summits
seeming to be the same. Those who give an account of the arterial pattern of
the mountains are thus obliged to speak at length. In some cases, to describe a
few kilometers of ramifications needs a pile of documentation, and dealing with
the main line of a day’s march takes a sequence of chapters.
As to the confusion of the local patois, in the space of fifty kilometers a
river may have fifty names and an encampment covering a kilometer and a half
may have three designations. Such is the unreliability of the nomenclature.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a><br>
<br><b>(p.2)</b> 
The hilly and jungly tracts were those in which the dacoits held out longest.
Such were [<i>sic</i>] the country between Minbu and Thayetrnyo and the terai
[swampy lowland belt] at the foot of the Shan Hills and the Arakan and Chin
Hills. Here pursuit was impossible. The tracts are narrow and tortuous and admirably
suited for ambuscades. Except by the regular paths there were hardly
any means of approach; the jungle malaria was fatal to our troops; a column
could only penetrate the jungle and move on. The villages are small and far
between; they are generally compact and surrounded by dense, impenetrable
jungle. The paths were either just broad enough for a cart, or very narrow, and,
where they led through the jungle were overhung with brambles and thorny
creepers. A good deal of the dry grass is burned in March, but as soon as the
rains recommence the whole once more becomes impassible.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
<br>
<br>
The surface has been minutely trenched by winding streams. So numerous are
the creeks that the topographical map of a single representative county of 373
square miles indicated 339 named streams, that is, nine streams for each ten
square miles. The valleys are for the most part “V”-shaped, with rarely more
level space along the banks of a stream for a cabin and perhaps a garden patch. . . . 
The isolation occasioned by methods of travel so slow and difficult is intensified
by several circumstances. For one thing, the routes are round-about.
Travel is either down one branch along a creek and up another branch, or up
a stream to a divide and down another stream on the further side of the ridge.
This being the case, married women living within ten miles of their parents
have passed a dozen years without going back to see them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a>
</blockquote>

Behind each lament lies a particular project of rule: Han rule under
the Qing, British rule within the Empire, and finally, the rule of orthodox
Protestant Christianity in Appalachia. All would style themselves, unselfconsciously,
as bearers of order, progress, enlightenment, and civilization. All
wished to extend the advantages of administrative discipline, associated with
the state or organized religion, to areas previously ungoverned.<br>
<br>
How might we best understand the fraught dialectical relations between
such projects of rule and their agents, on the one hand, and zones of relative
autonomy and their inhabitants, on the other? This relationship is particularly
salient in mainland Southeast Asia, where it demarcates the greatest
social cleavage that shapes much of the region’s history: that between hill
peoples and valley peoples or between upstream (<i>hulu</i> in the Malay world)
and downstream (<i>hilir</i>) peoples.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>
 In tracing this dialectic with some care, I
believe it also traces a path to a novel historical understanding of the global
process of state formation in the valleys and the peopling of the hills. 
<br><br>
<b>(p.3)</b> 
The encounter between expansionary states and self-governing peoples
is hardly confined to Southeast Asia. It is echoed in the cultural and administrative
process of “internal colonialism” that characterizes the formation of
most modern Western nation-states; in the imperial projects of the Romans,
the Hapsburgs, the Ottomans, the Han, and the British; in the subjugation
of indigenous peoples in “white-settler” colonies such as the United States,
Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Algeria; in the dialectic between sedentary,
town-dwelling Arabs and nomadic pastoralists that have characterized
much of Middle Eastern history.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
 The precise shape of the encounters is,
to be sure, unique to each case. Nevertheless, the ubiquity of the encounter
between self-governing and state-governed peoples-variously styled as the
raw and the cooked, the wild and the tamed, the hill/forest people and
the valley/cleared-land people, upstream and downstream, the barbarian and
the civilized, the backward and the modern, the free and the bound, the
people without history and the people with history-provides us with many
possibilities for comparative triangulation. We shall take advantage of these
opportunities where we can.<br>
<br>
A World of Peripheries<br>
<br>
In the written record-that is to say, from the beginning of grain-based,
agrarian civilizations-the encounter we are examining can fairly be said to
preoccupy rulers. But if we stand back and widen the historical lens still
further, seeing the encounter in human rather than state-civilization terms,
it is astonishing how recent and rapid the encounter has been. <i>Homo sapiens
sapiens</i> has been around for something like two hundred thousand years, and
only about sixty thousand, at the outside, in Southeast Asia. There the region’s
first small concentrations of sedentary populations appear not earlier
than the first millennium before the common era (CE) and represent a mere
smudge in the historical landscape-localized, tenuous, and evanescent.
Until shortly before the common era, the very last 1 percent of human history,
the social landscape consisted of elementary, self-governing, kinship
units that might, occasionally, cooperate in hunting, feasting, skirmishing,
trading, and peacemaking. It did not contain anything one could call a state.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a>

In other words, living in the absence of state structures has been the standard
human condition.<br>
<br>
The founding of agrarian states, then, was the contingent event that
created a distinction, hence a dialectic, between a settled, state-governed <b>(p.4)</b> 
population and a frontier penumbra of less governed or virtually autonomous
peoples. Until at least the early nineteenth century, the difficulties of
transportation, the state of military technology, and, above all, demographic
realities placed sharp limits on the reach of even the most ambitious states.
Operating in a population density of only 5.5 persons per square kilometer
in 1600 (compared with roughly 35 for India and China), a ruler’s subjects in
Southeast Asia had relatively easy access to a vast, land-rich frontier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a>
 That
frontier operated as a rough and ready homeostatic device; the more a state
pressed its subjects, the fewer subjects it had. The frontier underwrote popular
freedom. Richard O’Connor captures this dialectic nicely: “Once states
appeared, adaptive conditions changed yet again-at least for farmers. At
that moment, mobility allowed farmers to escape the impositions of states
and their wars. I call this tertiary dispersion. The other two revolutions-agriculture
and complex society-were secure but the state’s domination of
its peasantry was not, and so we find a strategy of ‘collecting people ... and
establishing villages.’”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>
<br>
<br>
The Last Enclosure<br>
<br>
Only the modern state, in both its colonial and its independent guises, has
had the resources to realize a project of rule that was a mere glint in the eye
of its precolonial ancestor: namely to bring nonstate spaces and people to
heel. This project in its broadest sense represents the last great enclosure
movement in Southeast Asia. It has been pursued-albeit clumsily and with
setbacks-consistently for at least the past century. Governments, whether
colonial or independent, communist or neoliberal, populist or authoritarian,
have embraced it fully. The headlong pursuit of this end by regimes otherwise
starkly different suggests that such projects of administrative, economic, and
cultural standardization are hard-wired into the architecture of the modern
state itself.<br>
<br>
Seen from the state center, this enclosure movement is, in part, an effort
to integrate and monetize the people, lands, and resources of the periphery so
that they become, to use the French term, <i>rentable</i>-auditable contributors
to the gross national product and to foreign exchange. In truth, peripheral
peoples had always been firmly linked economically to the lowlands and to
world trade. In some cases, they appear to have provided most of the products
valued in international commerce. Nevertheless, the attempt to fully incorporate
them has been culturally styled as development, economic progress, <b>(p.5)</b>
literacy, and social integration. In practice, it has meant something else. The
objective has been less to make them productive than to ensure that their
economic activity was legible, taxable, assessable, and confiscatable or, failing
that, to replace it with forms of production that were. Everywhere they
could, states have obliged mobile, swidden cultivators to settle in permanent
villages. They have tried to replace open common-property land tenure with
closed common property: collective farms or, more especially, the individual
freehold property of liberal economies. They have seized timber and mineral
resources for the national patrimony. They have encouraged, whenever possible,
cash, monocropping, plantation-style agriculture in place of the more
biodiverse forms of cultivation that prevailed earlier. The term <i>enclosure</i> 
seems entirely appropriate for this process, mimicking as it does the English
enclosures that, in the century after 1761, swallowed half of England’s common
arable land in favor of large-scale, private, commercial production.<br>
<br>
The novel and revolutionary aspect of this great enclosure movement
is apparent if we open our historical lens to its widest aperture. The very
earliest states in China and Egypt-and later, Chandra-Gupta India, classical
Greece, and republican Rome-were, in demographic terms, insignificant.
They occupied a minuscule portion of the world’s landscape, and their subjects
were no more than a rounding error in the world’s population figures.
In mainland Southeast Asia, where the first states appear only around the
middle of the first millennium of the common era, their mark on the landscape
and its peoples is relatively trivial when compared with their oversized
place in the history books. Small, moated, and walled centers together
with their tributary villages, these little nodes of hierarchy and power were
both unstable and geographically confined. To an eye not yet hypnotized by
archaeological remains and state-centric histories, the landscape would have
seemed virtually all periphery and no centers. Nearly all the population and
territory were outside their ambit.<br>
<br>
Diminutive though these state centers were, they possessed a singular
strategic and military advantage in their capacity to concentrate manpower
and foodstuffs in one place. Irrigated rice agriculture on permanent fields
was the key.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a>
 As a new political form, the padi state was an ingathering of
previously stateless peoples. Some subjects were no doubt attracted to the
possibilities for trade, wealth, and status available at the court centers, while
others, almost certainly the majority, were captives and slaves seized in warfare
or purchased from slave-raiders. The vast “barbarian” periphery of these
small states was a vital resource in at least two respects. First, it was the <b>(p.6)</b> 
source of hundreds of important trade goods and forest products necessary
to the prosperity of the padi state. And second, it was the source of the most
important trade good in circulation: the human captives who formed the
working capital of any successful state. What we know of the classical states
such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as the early Khmer, Thai, and Burmese
states, suggests that most of their subjects were formally unfree: slaves,
captives, and their descendants.<br>
<br>
The enormous ungoverned periphery surrounding these minute states
also represented a challenge and a threat. It was home to fugitive, mobile
populations whose modes of subsistence-foraging, hunting, shifting cultivation,
fishing, and pastoralism-were fundamentally intractable to state
appropriation. The very diversity, fluidity, and mobility of their livelihoods
meant that for an agrarian state adapted to sedentary agriculture, this ungoverned
landscape and its people were fiscally sterile. Unless they wished to
trade, their production was inaccessible for yet another reason. Whereas the
early states were nearly everywhere the creature of arable plains and plateaus,
much of the more numerous ungoverned population lived, from a state perspective,
in geographically difficult terrain: mountains, marshland, swamps,
arid steppes, and deserts. Even if, as was rarely the case, their products were
in principle appropriable, they were effectively out of range owing to dispersal
and the difficulties of transportation. The two zones were ecologically
complementary and therefore natural trading partners, but such trade could
rarely be coerced; it took the form of voluntary exchange.<br>
<br>
For early state elites, the periphery-seen frequently as the realm of
“barbarian tribes”-was also a potential threat. Rarely-but memorably, in
the case of the Mongols and the Huns and Osman and his conquering band-a 
militarized pastoral people might overrun the state and destroy it or rule in
its place. More commonly, nonstate peoples found it convenient to raid the
settlements of sedentary farming communities subject to the state, sometimes
exacting systematic tribute from them in the manner of states. Just as
states encouraged sedentary agriculture for its “easy pickings,” so, too, did
raiders find it attractive as a site of appropriation.<br>
<br>
The main, long-run threat of the ungoverned periphery, however, was
that it represented a constant temptation, a constant alternative to life within
the state. Founders of a new state often seized arable land from its previous
occupants, who might then either be incorporated or choose to move away.
Those who fled became, one might say, the first refugees from state power,
joining others outside the state’s reach. When and if the state’s reach expanded,
still others faced the same dilemma.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.7)</b><br>
<br>
At a time when the state seems pervasive and inescapable, it is easy to
forget that for much of history, living within or outside the state-or in an
intermediate zone-was a choice, one that might be revised as the circumstances
warranted. A wealthy and peaceful state center might attract a growing
population that found its advantages rewarding. This, of course, fits the
standard civilizational narrative of rude barbarians mesmerized by the prosperity
made possible by the king’s peace and justice-a narrative shared by
most of the world’s salvational religions, not to mention Thomas Hobbes.<br>
<br>
This narrative ignores two capital facts. First, as we have noted, it appears
that much, if not most, of the population of the early states was unfree;
they were subjects under duress. The second fact, most inconvenient for the
standard narrative of civilization, is that it was very common for state subjects
to run away. Living within the state meant, virtually by definition, taxes,
conscription, corvée labor, and, for most, a condition of servitude; these conditions
were at the core of the state’s strategic and military advantages. When
these burdens became overwhelming, subjects moved with alacrity to the
periphery or to another state. Under premodern conditions, the crowding of
population, domesticated animals, and the heavy reliance on a single grain
had consequences for both human and crop health that made famines and
epidemics more likely. And finally, the early states were warmaking machines
as well, producing hemorrhages of subjects fleeing conscription, invasion,
and plunder. Thus the early state extruded populations as readily as it absorbed
them, and when, as was often the case, it collapsed altogether as the
result of war, drought, epidemic, or civil strife over succession, its populations
were disgorged. States were, by no means, a once-and-for-all creation.
Innumerable archaeological finds of state centers that briefly flourished and
were then eclipsed by warfare, epidemics, famine, or ecological collapse depict
a long history of state formation and collapse rather than permanence.
For long periods people moved in and out of states, and “stateness” was,
itself, often cyclical and reversible.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a>
<br>
<br>
This pattern of state-making and state-unmaking produced, over time,
a periphery that was composed as much of refugees as of peoples who had
never been state subjects. Much of the periphery of states became a zone of
refuge or “shatter zone,” where the human shards of state formation and
rivalry accumulated willy nilly, creating regions of bewildering ethnic and
linguistic complexity. State expansion and collapse often had a ratchet effect
as well, with fleeing subjects driving other peoples ahead of them seeking
safety and new territory. Much of the Southeast Asian massif is, in effect, a
shatter zone. The reputation of the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan <b>(p.8)</b> 
as a “museum of human races” reflects this history of migration. Shatter
zones are found wherever the expansion of states, empires, slave-trading, and
wars, as well as natural disasters, have driven large numbers of people to seek
refuge in out-of-the-way places: in Amazonia, in highland Latin America
(with the notable exception of the Andes, with their arable highland plateaus
and states), in that corridor of highland Africa safe from slave-raiding, in the
Balkans and the Caucasus. The diagnostic characteristics of shatter zones
are their relative geographical inaccessibility and the enormous diversity of
tongues and cultures.<br>
<br>
Note that this account of the periphery is sharply at odds with the official
story most civilizations tell about themselves. According to that tale, a
backward, naive, and perhaps barbaric people are gradually incorporated into
an advanced, superior, and more prosperous society and culture. If, instead,
many of these ungoverned barbarians had, at one time or another, elected,
as a political choice, to take their distance from the state, a new element of
political agency enters the picture. Many, perhaps most, inhabitants of the
ungoverned margins are not remnants of an earlier social formation, left behind,
or, as some lowland folk accounts in Southeast Asia have it, “our living
ancestors.” The situation of populations that have deliberately placed themselves
at the state’s periphery has occasionally been termed, infelicitously,
secondary primitivism. Their subsistence routines, their social organization,
their physical dispersal, and many elements of their culture, far from being
the archaic traits of a people left behind, are purposefully crafted both to
thwart incorporation into nearby states and to minimize the likelihood that
statelike concentrations of power will arise among them. State evasion and
state prevention permeate their practices and, often, their ideology as well.
They are, in other words, a “state effect.” They are “barbarians by design.”
They continue to conduct a brisk and mutually advantageous trade with lowland
centers while steering clear of being politically captured.<br>
<br>
Once we entertain the possibility that the “barbarians” are not just
“there” as a residue but may well have chosen their location, their subsistence
practices, and their social structure to maintain their autonomy, the standard
civilizational story of social evolution collapses utterly. The temporal, civilizational
series-from foraging to swiddening (or to pastoralism), to sedentary
grain cultivation, to irrigated wet-rice farming-and its near-twin, the series
from roving forest bands to small clearings, to hamlets, to villages, to towns,
to court centers: these are the underpinning of the valley state’s sense of superiority.
What if the presumptive “stages” of these series were, in fact, an array
of social options, each of which represented a distinctive positioning <b>(p.9)</b> 
vis-à-vis the state? And what if, over considerable periods of time, many groups
have moved strategically among these options toward more presumptively
“primitive” forms in order to keep the state at arm’s length? On this view, the
civilizational discourse of the valley states-and not a few earlier theorists of
social evolution-is not much more than a self-inflating way of confounding
the status of state-subject with civilization and that of self-governing peoples
with primitivism.<br>
<br>
The logic of the argument made throughout this book would essentially
reverse this logic. Most, if not all, the characteristics that appear to stigmatize
hill peoples-their location at the margins, their physical mobility, their
swidden agriculture, their flexible social structure, their religious heterodoxy,
their egalitarianism, and even the nonliterate, oral cultures-far from being
the mark of primitives left behind by civilization, are better seen on a long
view as adaptations designed to evade both state capture and state formation.
They are, in other words, political adaptations of nonstate peoples to a world
of states that are, at once, attractive and threatening.<br>
<br>
Creating Subjects<br>
<br>
Avoiding the state was, until the past few centuries, a real option. A thousand
years ago most people lived outside state structures, under loose-knit empires
or in situations of fragmented sovereignty.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a>
 Today it is an option that is fast
vanishing. To appreciate how the room for maneuver has been drastically
curtailed in the past millennium, a radically schematic and simplified fast-forward
history of the balance of power between stateless peoples and states
may be helpful.<br>
<br>
The permanent association of the state and sedentary agriculture is at
the center of this story.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
 Fixed-field grain agriculture has been promoted
by the state and has been, historically, the foundation of its power. In turn,
sedentary agriculture leads to property rights in land, the patriarchal family
enterprise, and an emphasis, also encouraged by the state, on large families.
Grain farming is, in this respect, inherently expansionary, generating, when
not checked by disease or famine, a surplus population, which is obliged to
move and colonize new lands. By any long-run perspective, then, it is grain
agriculture that is “nomadic” and aggressive, constantly reproducing copies
of itself, while, as Hugh Brody aptly notes, foragers and hunters, relying on
a single area and demographically far more stable, seem by comparison “profoundly
settled.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>
<br>
<br>
The massive expansion of European power, via colonialism and white <b>(p.10)</b> 
settler colonies, represented a vast expansion of sedentary agriculture. In the
“neo-Europes” such as North America, Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand,
Europeans reproduced, as far as possible, the agriculture with which
they were familiar. In colonies with preexisting states based on sedentary
agriculture, the Europeans replaced the indigenous overlords as sovereigns,
collecting taxes and encouraging agriculture as had their predecessors, but
more effectively. All other subsistence patterns, except when they provided
valuable trade goods (for example, furs), were, fiscally speaking, considered
sterile. Thus foragers, hunters, shifting-cultivators, and pastoralists were bypassed
and ignored or driven from potentially arable farmland into territories
considered wastelands. Nevertheless, as late as the end of the eighteenth
century, though they were no longer a majority of the world’s population,
nonstate peoples still occupied the greater part of the world’s landmass-forest
lands, rugged mountains, steppes, deserts, polar regions, marshes, and
inaccessibly remote zones. Such regions were still a potential refuge for those
who had reason to flee the state.<br>
<br>
These stateless peoples were not, by and large, easily drawn into the
fiscally legible economy of wage labor and sedentary agriculture. On this definition,
“civilization” held little attraction for them when they could have all
the advantages of trade without the drudgery, subordination, and immobility
of state subjects. The widespread resistance of stateless peoples led directly to
what might be called the golden age of slavery along the littoral of the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans and in Southeast Asia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a>
 From the perspective adopted
here, populations were forcibly removed en masse from settings where their
production and labor were illegible and inappropriable and were relocated in
colonies and plantations where they could be made to grow cash crops (tea,
cotton, sugar, indigo, coffee) which might contribute to the profits of landowners
and the fiscal power of the state.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>
 This first step of enclosure required
forms of capture and bondage designed to relocate them from nonstate spaces
where they were generally more autonomous (and healthy!) to places where
their labor could be appropriated.<br>
<br>
The final two stages of this massive enclosure movement belong, in the
case of Europe, to the nineteenth century and, in the case of Southeast Asia,
largely to the late twentieth century. They mark such a radical shift in the
relationship between states and their peripheries that they fall largely outside
the story I tell here. In this last period, “enclosure” has meant not so much
shifting people from stateless zones to areas of state control but rather colonizing
the periphery itself and transforming it into a fully governed, fiscally
fertile zone. Its immanent logic, unlikely ever to be fully realized, is the <b>(p.11)</b> 
complete elimination of nonstate spaces. This truly imperial project, made possible
only by distance-demolishing technologies (all-weather roads, bridges,
railroads, airplanes, modern weapons, telegraph, telephone, and now modern
information technologies including global positioning systems), is so novel
and its dynamics so different that my analysis here makes no further sense in
Southeast Asia for the period after, say, 1950. Modern conceptions of national
sovereignty and the resource needs of mature capitalism have brought that
final enclosure into view.<br>
<br>
The hegemony, in this past century, of the nation-state as the standard
and nearly exclusive unit of sovereignty has proven profoundly inimical to
nonstate peoples. State power, in this conception, is the state’s monopoly of
coercive force that must, in principle, be fully projected to the very edge of its
territory, where it meets, again in principle, another sovereign power projecting 
its command to its own adjacent frontier. Gone, in principle, are the large
areas of no sovereignty or mutually canceling weak sovereignties. Gone too,
of course, are peoples under no particular sovereignty. As a practical matter,
most nation-states have tried, insofar as they had the means, to give substance
to this vision, establishing armed border posts, moving loyal populations to
the frontier and relocating or driving away “disloyal” populations, clearing
frontier lands for sedentary agriculture, building roads to the borders, and
registering hitherto fugitive peoples.<br>
<br>
On the heels of this notion of sovereignty came the realization that
these neglected and seemingly useless territories to which stateless peoples
had been relegated were suddenly of great value to the economies of mature
capitalism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a>
 They contained valuable resources-oil, iron ore, copper, lead,
timber, uranium, bauxite, the rare metals essential to the aerospace and
electronics industries, hydroelectric sites, bioprospecting and conservation
areas-that might in many cases be the linchpin of state revenue. Places that
long ago might have been desirable for their deposits of silver, gold, and gems,
not to mention slaves, became the object of a new gold rush. All the more
reason to project state power to the nethermost reaches of these ungoverned
regions and bring their inhabitants under firm control.<br>
<br>
Occupying and controlling the margins of the state implied a cultural
policy as well. Much of the periphery along national borders of mainland
Southeast Asia is inhabited by peoples linguistically and culturally distinct
from the populations that dominate the state cores. Alarmingly, they spill
promiscuously across national frontiers, generating multiple identities and
possible foci of irredentism or secession. Weak valley states have permitted,
or rather tolerated, a certain degree of autonomy when they had little choice. <b>(p.12)</b>
Where they could, however, all states in the region have tried to bring such
peoples under their routine administration, to encourage and, more rarely,
to insist upon linguistic, cultural, and religious alignment with the majority
population at the state core. This meant, in Thailand, encouraging, say, the
Lahu to become Thai-speaking, literate, Buddhist subjects of the monarchy.
In Burma it meant encouraging, say, the Karen to become Burmese-speaking
Buddhists loyal to the military junta.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a>
<br>
<br>
Parallel to policies of economic, administrative, and cultural absorption
has been the policy, driven by both demographic pressure and self-conscious
design, of engulfment. Huge numbers of land-hungry majorities from the
plains have moved, or been moved, to the hills. There, they replicate valley
settlement patterns and sedentary agriculture, and, over time, they demographically
dominate the dispersed, less numerous hill peoples. The combination
of forced settlement and engulfment is nicely illustrated by a series
of Vietnamese mobilization campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s: “Campaign
to Sedentarize the Nomads,” “Campaign for Fixed Cultivation and Fixed
Residence,” “Storm the Hills Campaign,” and “Clear the Hills by Torchlight
Campaign.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a>
<br>
<br>
Culturally, this reduction and standardization of relatively autonomous,
self-governing communities is a process of long historical lineage. It is an
integral theme of the historical consciousness of each of the large mainland
Southeast Asian states. In the Vietnamese official national narrative the
“march to the south”-to the Mekong and the trans-Bassac Deltas-inaccurate
though it is as a description of the historical process, vies with the wars of
national liberation for pride of place.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a>
 Burmese and Thai history are no less
marked by the movement of population from their more northern historical
cores of Mandalay, Ayutthaya, and what is now Hanoi into the Irrawaddy,
Chao Praya, and Mekong river deltas, respectively. The great cosmopolitan,
maritime cities of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), Rangoon, and Bangkok ,
that grew to serve this onetime frontier, delta, hinterland have come, demographically,
to dominate the earlier inland capitals.<br>
<br>
Internal colonialism, broadly understood, aptly describes this process.
It involved the absorption, displacement, and/or extermination of the previous
inhabitants. It involved a botanical colonization in which the landscape
was transformed-by deforestation, drainage, irrigation, and levees-to accommodate
crops, settlement patterns, and systems of administration familiar
to the state and to the colonists. One way of appreciating the effect of this
colonization is to view it as a massive reduction of vernaculars of all kinds: of
vernacular languages, minority peoples, vernacular cultivation techniques,
<b>(p.13)</b> vernacular land tenure systems, vernacular hunting, gathering, and forestry
techniques, vernacular religion, and so on. The attempt to bring the periphery
into line is read by representatives of the sponsoring state as providing
civilization and progress-where progress is, in turn, read as the intrusive
propagation of the linguistic, agricultural, and religious practices of the
dominant ethnic group: the Han, the Kinh, the Burman, the Thai.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>
<br>
<br>
The remaining self-governing peoples and spaces of mainland Southeast
Asia are much diminished. We shall, for the most part, concentrate on
the so-called hill peoples (often mistakenly called tribes) of mainland Southeast
Asia, particularly Burma. While I will clarify what I mean by the awkward
term <i>nonstate spaces</i>, it is not simply a synonym for hills or for higher
altitudes. States, being associated with concentrated grain production, typically
arise where there is a substantial expanse of arable land. In mainland
Southeast Asia, this agro-ecology is generally at low elevations, allowing us
to speak of “valley states” and “hill peoples.” Where, as in the Andes, most
easily cultivable land under traditional conditions is located at high elevations,
it is the other way around. The states were in the hills and nonstate
spaces were downhill in the humid lowlands. Thus the key variable is not
so much elevation per se as the possibility for concentrated grain production.
<i>Nonstate space</i>, by contrast, points to locations where, owing largely to
geographical obstacles, the state has particular difficulty in establishing and
maintaining its authority. A Ming emperor had something like this in mind
when he described the southwest provinces of his kingdom: “The roads are
long and dangerous, the mountains and rivers present great obstacles, and
the customs and practices differ.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a>
 But swamps, marshes, mangrove coasts,
deserts, volcanic margins, and even the open sea, like the ever growing and
changing deltas of Southeast Asia’s great rivers, all function in much the
same way. Thus it is difficult or inaccessible terrain, regardless of elevation,
that presents great obstacles to state control. As we shall see at great length,
such places have often served as havens of refuge for peoples resisting or fleeing
the state.<br>
<br>
The Great Mountain Kingdom; or, “Zomia”; or, The Marches of Mainland Southeast Asia<br>
<br>
One of the largest remaining nonstate spaces in the world, if not <i>the</i> largest,
is the vast expanse of uplands, variously termed the Southeast Asian <i>massif</i> 
and, more recently, Zomia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a>
 This great mountain realm on the marches <b>(p.14)</b> 
of mainland Southeast Asia, China, India, and Bangladesh sprawls across
roughly 2.5 million square kilometers-an area roughly the size of Europe.
As one of the first scholars to identify the massif and its peoples as a single
object of study, Jean Michaud has traced its extent: “From north to south, it
includes southern and western Sichuan, all of Guizhou and Yunnan, western
and northern Guangxi, western Guangdong, most of northern Burma with
an adjacent segment of extreme [north]eastern India, the north and west of
Thailand, practically all of Laos above the Mekong Valley, northern and central
Vietnam along the Annam Cordillera, and the north and eastern fringes
of Cambodia.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>
<br>
<br>
Rough calculations would put Zomia minority populations alone at
around eighty million to one hundred million.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>
 Its peoples are fragmented
into hundreds of ethnic identities and at least five language families that defy
any simple classification.<br>
<br>
Lying at altitudes from two hundred or three hundred meters above
sea level to more than four thousand meters, Zomia could be thought of as
a Southeast Asian Appalachia, were it not for the fact that it sprawls across
eight nation-states. A better analogy would be Switzerland, a mountain
kingdom at the periphery of Germany, France, and Italy that itself became
a nation-state. Borrowing Ernest Gellner’s felicitous phrase referring to the
Berbers of the High Atlas Mountains, this huge hilly zone might be seen as a
“pervasive Switzerland without cuckoo clocks.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a>
 Far from being a hilly nation,
however, this upland belt lies on the marches, far from the main population
centers of the nations it traverses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a>
 Zomia is marginal in almost every
respect. It lies at a great distance from the main centers of economic activity;
it bestrides a contact zone between eight nation-states and several religious
traditions and cosmologies.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>
<br>
<br>
Scholarship organized historically around the classical states and their
cultural cores and, more recently, around the nation-state is singularly ill-equipped
to examine this upland belt as a whole. Willem van Schendel is
one of a handful of pioneers who have argued that these cumulative nation-state
“shards” merit consideration as a distinctive region. He has gone so far
as to give it the dignity of a name of its own: Zomia, a term for highlander
common to several related Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the India-Bangladesh-
Burma border area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>
 More precisely, <i>Zo</i> is a relational term
meaning “remote” and hence carries the connotation of living in the hills;
<i>Map I.</i>Mainland Southeast Asia. <b>(p.16)</b>
<i>Mi</i> means “people.” As is the case elsewhere in Southeast Asia <i>Mi-zo</i> or
<i>Zo-mi</i> designated a remote hill people, while at the same time the ethnic label
applies to a geographical niche.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a>
 Although van Schendel proposes a bold
expansion of Zomia’s boundanes to Afghamstan and beyond, I will confine
my use of the term to the hilly areas eastward, beginning with the Naga and
Mizo hills in northern India and Bangladesh’s Chittagong Hill Tracts.
Zomia, at first glance, would seem an unlikely candidate for consideration
as a distinctive region. The premise for calling a geographical area a
region is typically that it shares important cultural features that mark it off
from adjacent areas. In this fashion, Fernand Braudel was able to show that
the coastal societies around the Mediterranean Sea constituted a region,
owing to their long and intense commercial and cultural connections.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a>
 Despite
political and religious chasms between, say, Venice and Istanbul, they
were integral parts of a recognizable world of exchange and mutual influence.
Anthony Reid has made a similar, and in many respects, more powerful claim
for the Sunda Shelf littoral in maritime Southeast Asia, where trade and migration
were, if anything, easier than in the Mediterranean.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a>
 The principle
behind region-making in each case is that, for the premodern world, water,
especially if it is calm, joins people, whereas mountains, especially if they are
high and rugged, divide people. As late as 1740 it took no more time to sail
from Southampton to the Cape of Good Hope than to travel by stagecoach
from London to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
On these grounds, hilly Zomia would seem to be a “negative” region.
Variety, more than uniformity, is its trademark. In the space of a hundred
kilometers in the hills one can find more cultural variation-in language,
dress, settlement pattern, ethnic identification, economic activity, and religious
practices-than one would ever find in the lowland river valleys. Zomia
may not quite attain the prodigious cultural variety of deeply fissured New
Guinea, but its complex ethnic and linguistic mosaic has presented a bewildering
puzzle for ethnographers and historians, not to mention would-be
rulers. Scholarly work on the area has been as fragmented and isolated as the
terrain itself seemed to be.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a>
<br>
<br>
I will argue not only that Zomia qualifies as a region in the strong sense
of the term, but also that it is impossible to provide a satisfactory account of
the valley states without understanding the central role played by Zomia in
their formation and collapse. The dialectic or coevolution of hill and valley,
[<i>Map 2</i> “Zomia,” on the mainland Southeast Asian massif] <b>(p.18)</b>
as antagonistic but deeply connected spaces, is, I believe, the essential point
of departure for making sense of historical change in Southeast Asia.<br>
<br>
Most of what the hills share as physical and social spaces marks them off
fairly sharply from the more populous lowland centers. The population of the
hills is far more dispersed and culturally diverse than that of the valleys. It is
as if the difficulties of terrain and relative isolation have, over many centuries,
encouraged a kind of “speciation” of languages, dialects, dress, and cultural
practices. The relative availability of forest resources and open, if steep, land
has also allowed far more diverse subsistence practices than in the valleys,
where wet-rice monocropping often prevails. Swiddening (or slash-and-burn
agriculture), which requires more land and requires clearing new fields and
occasionally shifting settlement sites, is far more common in the hills.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, social structure in the hills is both more flexible and
more egalitarian than in the hierarchical, codified valley societies. Hybrid
identities, movement, and the social fluidity that characterizes many frontier
societies are common. Early colonial officials, taking an inventory of their
new possessions in the hills, were confused to encounter hamlets with several
“peoples” living side by side: hill people who spoke three or four languages
and both individuals and groups whose ethnic identity had shifted, sometimes
within a single generation. Aspiring to Linnaean specificity in the classification
of peoples as well as flora, territorial administrators were constantly
frustrated by the bewildering flux of peoples who refused to stay put. There
was, however, one principle of location that brought some order to this apparent
anarchy of identity, and that was its relation to altitude.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a>
 As Edmund
Leach originally suggested, once one looks at Zomia not from a high-altitude
balloon but, rather, horizontally, in terms of lateral slices through the topography,
a certain order emerges.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a>
 In any given landscape, particular groups
often settled within a narrow range of altitudes to exploit the agro-economic
possibilities of that particular niche. Thus, for example, the Hmong have
tended to settle at very high altitudes (between one thousand and eighteen
hundred meters) and to plant maize, opium, and millet that will thrive at
that elevation. If from a high-altitude balloon or on a map they appear to
be a random scattering of small blotches, this is because they have occupied
the mountaintops and left the midslopes and intervening valleys to other
groups.<br>
<br>
Specialization by altitude and niche within the hills leads to scattering.
And yet long-distance travel, marriage alliances, similar subsistence patterns,
and cultural continuity help foster coherent identities across considerable <b>(p.19)</b> 
distances. The “Akha” along the Yunnan-Thai border and the “Hani” in the
upper reaches of the Red River in northern Vietnam are recognizably the
same culture, though separated by more than a thousand kilometers. They
typically have more in common with each another than either group has with
valley people a mere thirty or forty miles away. Zomia is thus knitted together
as a region not by a political unity, which it utterly lacks, but by comparable
patterns of diverse hill agriculture, dispersal and mobility, and rough
egalitarianism, which, not incidentally, includes a relatively higher status for
women than in the valleys.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a>
<br>
<br>
The signal, distinguishing trait of Zomia, vis-à-vis the lowland regions
it borders, is that it is relatively stateless. Historically, of course, there have
been states in the hills where a substantial fertile plateau and or a key node
in the overland trade routes made it possible. Nan Chao, Kengtung, Nan, and
Lan-na were among the best known.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a>
 They are the exceptions that prove the
rule. While state-making projects have abounded in the hills, it is fair to say
that few have come to fruition. Those would-be kingdoms that did manage
to defy the odds did so only for a relatively brief, crisis-strewn period.
Such episodes aside, the hills, unlike the valleys, have paid neither taxes
to monarchs nor regular tithes to a permanent religious establishment. They
have constituted a relatively free, stateless population of foragers and hill
farmers. Zomia’s situation at the frontiers of lowland state centers has contributed
to its relative isolation and the autonomy that such isolation favors.
Lying athwart state borders where multiple competing sovereignties abut
one another has itself afforded its peoples certain advantages for smuggling,
contraband, opium production, and the “small border powers” that negotiate
a tenuous, high-wire act of quasi-independence.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a>
<br>
<br>
A stronger and, I believe, more accurate political description is that the
hill populations of Zomia have actively resisted incorporation into the framework
of the classical state, the colonial state, and the independent nation-state.
Beyond merely taking advantage of their geographical isolation from centers
of state power, much of Zomia has “resisted the projects of nation-building
and state-making of the states to which it belonged.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a>
 This resistance came
especially to light after the creation of independent states after World War II,
when Zomia became the site of secessionist movements, indigenous rights
struggles, millennial rebellions, regionalist agitation, and armed opposition
to lowland states. But it is a resistance with deeper roots. In the precolonial
period, the resistance can be seen in a cultural refusal of lowland patterns and
in the flight of low landers seeking refuge in the hills.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.20)</b><br>
<br>
During the colonial era, the autonomy of the hills, politically and culturally,
was underwritten by the Europeans for whom a separately administered
hill zone was a makeweight against the lowland majorities resentful of
colonial rule. One effect of this classic divide-and-rule policy is that, with a
few exceptions, hill peoples typically played little or no role-or an antagonistic
one-in the anticolonial movements. They remained, at best, marginal
to the nationalist narrative or, at worst, were seen as a fifth column threatening
that independence. It is partly for such reasons that the postcolonial
lowland states have sought fully to exercise authority in the hills: by military
occupation, by campaigns against shifting cultivation, by forced settlements,
by promoting the migration of lowlanders to the hills, by efforts at religious
conversion, by space-conquering roads, bridges, and telephone lines, and by
development schemes that project government administration and lowland
cultural styles into the hills.<br>
<br>
The hills, however, are not simply a space of political resistance but
also a zone of cultural refusal. If it were merely a matter of political authority,
one might expect the hill society to resemble valley society culturally except
for their altitude and the dispersed settlement that the terrain favors. But
the hill populations do not generally resemble the valley centers culturally,
religiously, or linguistically. This cultural chasm between the mountains and
the plains has been claimed as something of a historical constant in Europe
as well, until quite recently. Fernand Braudel acknowledged the political autonomy
of the hills when he approvingly quoted Baron de Tott to the effect
that “the steepest places have always been the asylum of liberty.” But he
carried the argument much further, asserting the existence of an unbridgeable
cultural gap between plains and mountains. He wrote: “The mountains
are as a rule a world apart from civilizations which are an urban and lowland
achievement. Their history is to have none, to remain always on the fringes
of the great waves of civilization, even the longest and most persistent, which
may spread over great distances in the horizontal plane but are powerless to
move vertically when faced with an obstacle of several hundred meters.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>

Braudel was, in turn, only echoing a much older view captured by the great
fourteenth-century Arab philosopher Ibn Khaldun, who noted that “Arabs
can gain control only over flat territory” and do not pursue tribes that hide
in the mountains.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a>
 Compare Braudel’s bold assertion that civilizations can’t
climb hills to a nearly identical assertion made by Oliver Wolters, quoting
Paul Wheatley, about precolonial Southeast Asia: “Many people lived in the
distant highlands and were beyond the reach of the centers where records <b>(p.21)</b> 
survive. The <i>mandalas</i> [court centers of civilization and power] were a phenomenon
of the lowlands and even there, geographical conditions encouraged
under-government. Paul Wheatley puts it well when he notes that “the
Sanskritic tongue was stilled to silence at 500 meters.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a>
<br>
<br>
Scholars of Southeast Asia have been struck again and again by the
sharp limits the terrain, particularly altitude, has placed on cultural or political
influence. Paul Mus, writing of Vietnam and echoing Wheatley, noted
of the spread of the Vietnamese and their culture that “this ethnic adventure
stopped at the foot of the high country’s buttresses.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a>
 Owen Lattimore,
best known for his studies of China’s northern frontier, also remarked
that Indian and Chinese civilizations, like those cited by Braudel, traveled
well across the plains but ran out of breath when they encountered rugged
hills: “This kind of stratification extends far beyond China itself into the
Indochinese peninsula, Thailand and Burma with the influence of the ancient
high civilizations reaching far out over the lower levels where concentrated
agriculture and big cities are to be found, but not up into the higher
altitudes.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a>
<br>
<br>
Though Zomia is exceptionally diverse linguistically, the languages spoken
in the hills are, as a rule, distinct from those spoken in the plains. Kinship
structures, at least formally, also distinguish the hills from the lowlands. This
is in part what Edmund Leach had in mind when he characterized hill society
as following a “Chinese model” while lowland society followed an “Indian”
or Sanskritic model.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>
<br>
<br>
Hill societies are, as a rule, systematically different from valley societies.
Hill people tend to be animists, or, in the twentieth century, Christians,
who do not follow the “great tradition” salvation religions of lowland peoples
(Buddhism and Islam in particular). Where, as occasionally happens, they do
come to embrace the “world religion” of their valley neighbors, they are likely
to do so with a degree of heterodoxy and millenarian fervor that valley elites
find more threatening than reassuring. Hill societies do produce a surplus,
but they do not use that surplus to support kings and monks. The absence
of large, permanent, surplus-absorbing religious and political establishments
makes for a sociological pyramid in the hills that is rather flat and local when
compared with that of valley societies. Distinctions of status and wealth
abound in the hills, as in the valleys. The difference is that in the valleys they
tend to be supralocal and enduring, while in the hills they are both unstable
and geographically confined.<br>
<br>
This characterization obscures a great deal of variation in the political <b>(p.22)</b> 
structure of hill societies. The variation is not by any means simply a function
of “ethnicity,” although some hill peoples, such as the Lahu, Khmu,
and Akha, seem strongly egalitarian and decentralized. It is just as common,
however, to encounter groups that defy such generalizations. Among Karen,
Kachin, Chin, Hmong, Yao/Mien, and Wa, for example, there seem to be
both relatively hierarchical subgroups and relatively decentralized, egalitarian
subgroups. What is most striking and important is that the degree of
hierarchy and centralization is not constant over time. The variation, so far
as I can make out, depends largely on a kind of imitative state-making. That
is, it is either a kind of short-term war alliance or a sort of “booty-capitalism”
for slave-raiding and extracting tribute from lowland communities. Where
hill groups are in a tributary relationship with a valley kingdom- which does
not imply political incorporation or, necessarily, inferiority-it may be an
expedient to control a lucrative trade route or to safeguard privileged access
to valuable markets. Their political structures are, with extremely rare exceptions,
imitative in the sense that while they may have the trappings and rhetoric
of monarchy, they lack the substance: a taxpaying subject population or
direct control over their constituent units, let alone a standing army. Hill polities
are, almost invariably, redistributive, competitive feasting systems held
together by the benefits they are able to disburse. When they occasionally
appear to be relatively centralized, they resemble what Barfield has called the
“shadow-empires” of nomadic pastoralists, a predatory periphery designed
to monopolize trading and raiding advantages at the edge of an empire. They
are also typically parasitic in the sense that when their host-empires collapse,
so do they.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a>
<br>
<br>
Zones of Refuge<br>
<br>
There is strong evidence that Zomia is not simply a region of resistance to
valley states, but a region of refuge as well.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>
 By “refuge,” I mean to imply
that much of the population in the hills has, for more than a millennium and
a half, come there to evade the manifold afflictions of state-making projects
in the valleys. Far from being “left behind” by the progress of civilization in
the valleys, they have, over long periods of time, chosen to place themselves
out of the reach of the state. Jean Michaud notes, in this connection, that
what he calls nomadism in the hills can be “an escape or survival strategy”
and sees the unprecedented series of massive rebellions in the latter half of
the nineteenth century in central and southwest China as having pushed the <b>(p.23)</b> 
millions of refugees streaming south into the more remote highlands. He is
sympathetic to the view adopted here that Zomia is best seen historically as
a region of refuge from states, most especially the Han state. “It is probably
fair to say,” he concludes, “that the highland populations who migrated from
China to the ... highlands over the past five centuries were, at least in part,
pushed from their homelands by aggression from more powerful neighbors,
including especially Han expansion.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a>
<br>
<br>
Detailed and unambiguous documentary evidence of the conflicts generated
by Han expansion and the migratory flights it provoked is abundant
from the early Ming Dynasty (1368) onward, becoming even more abundant
under the Qing. Earlier documentation is harder to come by and more ambiguous,
owing to the great fluidity of ethnic and political labels. The general
pattern, however, seems to be as follows: as the reach of the Chinese state
grew, peoples at the point of expansion were either absorbed (becoming, in
time, Han) or moved away, often after a failed revolt. Those who left became,
at least for a time, distinct societies that could be said to have “self-marginalized”
by migration.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a>
 As the process was repeated again and again,
culturally complex zones of refuge sprang up in the hinterlands of the state.
“The history of the various non-state peoples of this region” can, Fiskesjö
believes, be written as the bifurcation between those who had long been in
the hills (for example, the Wa people) and those who sought refuge there:
“Among those who left [the zone of Chinese state power], we find many
Tibeto-Burman ethnolinguistic formations (Lahu, Hani, Akha, etc.) as well
as Miao or Hmong speakers, and other peoples ... described as ‘hill tribes
out of China’ with a ‘heritage of defeat’ that has led many of them during
the past few centuries, into the northern parts of the modern states of Thailand,
Burma, Laos, and Vietnam where many of them are still regarded as
newcomers.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a>
<br>
<br>
There, in regions beyond the states’ immediate writ and, thus, at some
remove from taxes, corvée labor, conscription, and the more than occasional
epidemics and crop failures associated with population concentration and
monocropping, such groups found relative freedom and safety. There, they
practiced what I will call escape agriculture: forms of cultivation designed to
thwart state appropriation. Even their social structure could fairly be called
escape social structure inasmuch as it was designed to aid dispersal and autonomy
and to ward off political subordination.<br>
<br>
The tremendous linguistic and ethnic fluidity in the hills is itself a crucial
social resource for adapting to changing constellations of power, <b>(p.24)</b> 
inasmuch as it facilitates remarkable feats of identity shape-shifting. Zomians
are not as a rule only linguistically and ethnically amphibious; they are, in
their strong inclination to follow charismatic figures who arise among them,
capable of nearly instantaneous social change, abandoning their fields and
houses to join or form a new community at the behest of a trusted prophet.
Their capacity to “turn on a dime” represents the ultimate in escape social
structure. Illiteracy in the hills can, more speculatively, be interpreted in the
same fashion. Virtually all hill peoples have legends claiming that they once
had writing and either lost it or that it was stolen from them. Given the considerable
advantages in plasticity of oral over written histories and genealogies,
it is at least conceivable to see the loss of literacy and of written texts as
a more or less deliberate adaptation to statelessness.<br>
<br>
The argument, in short, is that the history of hill peoples is best understood
as a history not of archaic remnants but of “runaways” from state-making
processes in the lowlands: a largely “maroon” society, providing
that we take a very long historical view. Many of the agricultural and social
practices of hill peoples can be best understood as techniques to make
good this evasion, while maintaining the economic advantages of the lowland
connection.<br>
<br>
The concentration of people and production at a single location required
some form of unfree labor when population was sparse, as it was in
Southeast Asia. All Southeast Asian states were slaving states, without exception,
some of them until well into the twentieth century. Wars in precolonial
Southeast Asia were less about territory than about the seizure of as many
captives as possible who were then resettled at the core of the winner’s territory.
They were not distinctive in this respect. After all, in Periclean Athens,
the population of slaves outnumbered full citizens by five to one.<br>
<br>
The effect of all state-making projects of this kind was to create a shatter
zone or flight zone to which those wishing to evade or to escape bondage
fled. These regions of refuge constituted a direct “state effect.” Zomia simply
happens to be, owing largely to the precocious early expansion of the Chinese
state, one of the most extensive and oldest zones of refuge. Such regions are,
however, inevitable by-products of coercive state-making and are found on
every continent. A few of them will figure as comparative cases in what follows,
but here I want to enumerate several examples to suggest how common
they are.<br>
<br>
The forced-labor characteristic of Spanish colonization in the New
World provoked the widespread flight of native peoples out of range, often <b>(p.25)</b> 
to hilly or arid places where they could live unmolested.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a>
 Such areas were
marked by great linguistic and ethnic diversity and occasionally by a simplification
of social structure and subsistence routines- foraging, shifting cultivation-
to increase mobility. The process was repeated in the Spanish Philippines,
where, it is claimed, the cordillera of northern Luzon was populated
almost entirely by lowland Filipinos fleeing Malay slave raids and the Spanish
<i>reducciones</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a>
 As peoples adapted to hill ecology, a process of ethnogenesis
followed, after which highland Filipinos were later misrepresented as the
descendants of separate, prehistoric migrations to the island.<br>
<br>
The Cossacks on Russia’s many frontiers represent another striking
example of the process. They were, at the outset, nothing more and nothing
less than runaway serfs from all over European Russia who accumulated at
the frontier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a>
 They became, depending on their location, different Cossack
“hosts”: the Don (for the Don River basin) Cossacks, the Azov (Sea) Cossacks,
and so on. There at the frontier, copying the horseback habits of their
Tatar neighbors and sharing a common open-land pasture, they became “a
people,” later used by the tsars, the Ottomans, and the Poles as cavalry. The
history of the Roma and Sinti (Gypsies) in late-seventeenth-century Europe
provides a further striking example.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a>
 Along with other stigmatized itinerant
peoples, they were subject to two forms of penal labor: galley slavery in the
Mediterranean basin and, in the northeast, forced conscription as soldiers or
military porters in Prussia-Brandenburg. As a result they accumulated in a
narrow band of territory that came to be known as the “outlaw corridor,” the
one location between the catchment areas of these twin, mortal dangers.<br>
<br>
Inasmuch as the captivity and bondage associated with early state-making
generate, in their wake, flight and zones of refuge, slavery as a labor
system produced many “Zomias” large and small. It is possible, in this context,
to delineate an upland, remote zone of West Africa that was relatively
safe from the five hundred-year-long worldwide slave-raiding and trade that
caught tens of millions of in its toils.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a>
 This zone of refuge grew in population
despite the difficulties of the terrain and the necessity for new subsistence
routines. Many of those who failed to evade the slave raids in Africa,
once transplanted to the New World, promptly escaped and created fugitive
slave (maroon) settlements wherever slavery was practiced: the famous highland
“cockpit” of Jamaica; Palmares in Brazil, a maroon community of some
twenty thousand inhabitants; and Surinam, the largest maroon population in
the hemisphere, are only three illustrations. Were we to include smaller scale
“refugia” such as marshes, swamps, and deltas, the list would multiply many <b>(p.26)</b> 
fold. To mention only a few, the great marsh on the lower Euphrates {drained
under Saddam Hussein’s rule) was for two thousand years a refuge from state
control. So, on a smaller scale, were the storied Great Dismal Swamp on the
North Carolina-Virginia border, the Pripet Marshes in Poland, now on the
Belarus-Ukraine border, and the Pontian Marshes near Rome (drained finally
by Mussolini) known as zones of refuge from the state. The list of such refugia
is at least as long as the list of coercive labor schemes that inevitably spawn
them.<br>
<br>
Hill societies in mainland Southeast Asia, then, for all their riotous
heterogeneity, have certain characteristics in common, and most of these
characteristics distinguish them sharply from their valley neighbors. They
encode a pattern of historic flight and hence a position of opposition if not
resistance. If it is this historical, structural relation that we hope to illuminate,
then it makes no sense whatever to confine ourselves to a nation-state framework. F
or much of the period we wish to examine there was no nation-state
and, when it did come into being late in the game, many hill people continued
to conduct their cross-border lives as if the state didn’t exist. The concept
of “Zomia” marks an attempt to explore a new genre of “area” studies, in
which the justification for designating the area has nothing to do with national
boundaries (for example, Laos) or strategic conceptions (for example, Southeast
Asia) but is rather based on certain ecological regularities and structural
relationships that do not hesitate to cross national frontiers. If we have our
way, the example of “Zomia studies” will inspire others to follow this experiment
elsewhere and improve on it.<br>
<br>
The Symbiotic History of Hills and Valleys<br>
<br>
Histories of the classical lowland court-states, taken in isolation, risk being
unintelligible or vastly misleading. Lowland states (mandala or modern) have
always existed in symbiosis with hill society.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>
 By <i>symbiosis</i>, I mean to invoke
the biological metaphor of two organisms living together in more or less intimate
association-in this case, social organisms. The term does not specify,
nor do I wish to do so here, whether this mutual dependence is antagonistic,
or even parasitic, or whether it is mutually beneficial, “synergistic.”<br>
<br>
It is not possible to write a coherent history of the hills that is not in
constant dialogue with lowland centers; nor is it possible to write a coherent
history of lowland centers that ignores its hilly periphery. By and large,
most students of hill societies have been sensitive to this dialectic, stressing <b>(p.27)</b> 
the deep history of symbolic, economic, and human traffic between the two
societies. The same typically cannot be said of work-even the most distinguished-
on lowland centers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a>
 The pattern is hardly surprising. Treatment
of lowland cultures and societies as self-contained entities (for example,
“Thai civilization,” “Chinese culture”) replicates the unreflective structure
of scholarship and, in doing so, adopts the hermetic view of culture that lowland
elites themselves wish to project. The fact is that hill and valley societies
have to be read against each other to make any sense. I attempt just such a
reading here.<br>
<br>
Writing an account of valley population centers without including the
hills would be like writing a history of colonial New England and the Middle
Atlantic States without considering the American frontier. It would be like
writing a history of antebellum slavery in the United States while leaving out
the freedmen and the lure of freedom in Canada. In each case; an external
frontier conditioned, bounded, and in many respects constituted what was
possible at the center. Accounts of lowland states that miss this dimension do
not merely “leave out” the hills; they ignore a set of boundary conditions and
exchanges that make the center what it is.<br>
<br>
The constant movement back and forth between the valleys and the
hills-its causes, its patterns, its consequences-will preoccupy us. Many
valley people are, as it were, “ex-hill people,” and many hill people are “ex-valley
people.” Nor did movement in one direction or the other preclude
subsequent moves. Depending on the circumstances, groups have disengaged
themselves from a state and then, later, sought to affiliate themselves (or been
seized by!) the same or another state. A century or two later, they might again
be found outside that state’s grasp, perhaps because they had moved away or
perhaps because the state in question had itself collapsed. Such shifts were
often accompanied by a shift in ethnic identity, broadly understood. I will argue
for a radically “constructionist” understanding of the so-called hill tribes
of mainland Southeast Asia. They are best understood, at least as a first approximation,
as a fugitive population that has come to the hills over the past
two millennia. This flight was not only from the Burman, Tai, and Siamese
states but also, and most especially, from the Han Empire during the expansionary
phases of the Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, when its forces
and settlers pressed into southwest China. In the hills they might have moved
several times subsequently, pressed by other, stronger fugitives or threatened
by a new state expansion, or in search of new land and autonomy. Their location
and many of their economic and cultural practices could again fairly be <b>(p.28)</b> 
termed a state effect. This picture is radically at odds with older prevailing
assumptions of a primeval population in the hills abandoned by those who
moved downhill and developed civilizations.<br>
<br>
By the same token, the valley centers of wet-rice cultivation may profitably
be seen as constituting a hill effect in the following ways. The valley
states are, of course, new structures historically speaking, dating back to
roughly the middle of the first millennium CE. They were formed from an
earlier ingathering of diverse peoples, some of whom may have adopted fixed-field
agriculture, but who were, by definition, not previously part of an established
state.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a>
 The very earliest mandala states were less engines of military
conquest than cultural spaces available to all those who wished to conform
to their religious, linguistic, and cultural formats, whatever their origin.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a>

Perhaps because such identities were newly confected from many cultural
shards, the resulting valley self-representations were at pains to distinguish
their culture from populations outside the state. Thus if hill society could be
termed a state effect, valley culture could be seen as a hill effect.
Most of the terms that we would translate as <i>crude</i>, <i>unrefined</i>, <i>barbaric</i>, 
and, in the Chinese case, <i>raw</i> refer directly to those who live in the hills
and forests. “Forest dweller” or “hill person” is shorthand for “uncivilized.”
Thus, despite a centuries-old, brisk traffic in people, goods, and culture across
the very permeable membrane between the hills and valleys, it is striking how
stark and durable the cultural divide remains in lived experience. Valley and
hill peoples generally have an essentialist understanding of the differences
between them that appears to be at odds with the historical evidence over the
long run.<br>
<br>
How can we make sense of this paradox? Perhaps the first step is to emphasize 
that the relationship between valley states and hill society is not just
symbiotic but also both contemporaneous and quasi-oppositional. In older
understandings of hill “tribes,” not to mention popular folklore today, they
are considered to be the historical remnants of an earlier stage of human history:
what we were like before we discovered wet-rice agriculture, learned to
write, developed the arts of civilization, and adopted Buddhism. While this
“just-so” story treats valley cultures as later, and higher, achievements of
civilization, raised from the muck of tribalism, as it were, it grossly distorts
the historical record. Valley states and hill peoples are, instead, constituted
in each other’s shadow, both reciprocal and contemporaneous. Hill societies
have always been in touch with imperial states in the valleys directly or via
maritime trade routes. Valley states, by the same token, have always been in <b>(p.29)</b> 
touch with the nonstate periphery-what Deleuze and Guattari call “the
local mechanisms of bands, margins, minorities, which continue to affirm the
rights of segmentary societies in opposition to the organs of state power.”
Such states are, in fact, “inconceivable independent of that relationship.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a>
<br>
<br>
Precisely the same case has been made about the relationship between
itinerant peoples-including pastoral nomads-and states. Thus Pierre Clastres
argues persuasively that the so-called primitive Amerindian societies of
South America were not ancient societies that had failed to invent settled
agriculture or state forms but rather previously sedentary cultivators who
abandoned agriculture and fixed villages in response to the effects of the
Conquest: both disease-induced demographic collapse and colonial forced
labor.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a>
 Their movement and subsistence techniques were designed to ward
off incorporation into the state. On the steppes of Central Asia the most ancient
nomads, Griaznov has shown, were former sedentary cultivators who
similarly left cultivation behind for political and demographic reasons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a>
 Lattimore
reached the same conclusion, insisting that pastoral nomadism arose
after farming and drew in sedentary cultivators at the edge of the grasslands
who “had detached themselves from farming communities.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a>
 Far from
being successive stages in social evolution, such states and nomadic peoples
are twins, born more or less at the same time and joined in a sometimes rancorous
but unavoidable embrace.<br>
<br>
This pattern of paired symbiosis and opposition is a staple of Middle
Eastern history and anthropology. In the Maghreb it takes the form of structural
opposition between Arabs and Berbers. Ernest Gellner’s classic <i>Saints
of the Atlas</i> captures the dynamic I have in mind. Gellner, too, emphasized
that the political autonomy and tribalism of the Berber population in the
High Atlas is “not a tribalism ‘prior to government’ but a political and partial
rejection of a particular government combined with some acceptance of
a wider culture and its ethic.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a>
 Sharing elements of a larger culture and a
faith in Islam, such tribal opposition is explicitly political and deliberately
so. Until very recently, Gellner claims, Moroccan history could be written in
terms of the opposition between the land of <i>makhazen</i> (the pale) and the land
of <i>siba</i> (beyond the pale). <i>Siba</i> could be defined as “institutional dissidence,”
though it has sometimes been translated as “anarchy.” In practice, <i>siba</i> means
“ungoverned,” a zone of political autonomy and independence, while <i>makhazen</i> 
means “governed,” subordinated to the state. Political autonomy was,
Gellner insists, a choice, not a given.<br>
<br>
To those groups that have self-consciously elected to move or to stay <b>(p.30)</b>
beyond the pale, Gellner applies the term <i>marginal tribalism</i> to emphasize that
their marginality is a political stance:

<blockquote>Such tribesmen know the possibility . . . of being incorporated in a more centralized
state. . . . Indeed, they may have deliberately rejected and violently
resisted the alternative. The tribes of the High Atlas are of this kind. Until the
advent of the modern state, they were dissident and self-consciously so. . . .
“Marginal” tribalism . . . [is] the type of tribal society which exists at the edge
of non-tribal societies. It arises from the fact that the inconveniences of submission
make it attractive to withdraw from political authority and the balance
of power, the nature of the mountainous or desert terrain make it feasible. Such
tribalism is politically marginal. It knows what it rejects.</blockquote>

In the Maghreb, as in Zomia, the distinction between a zone of state rule
and a marginal, autonomous zone was geographical and ecological as well as
political. There is a “rough tie-up between high-ground, Berber speech and
political dissidence,” such that “gorges and mountains were a clear dividing
line between the land of the government (<i>bled el-makhazen</i>) and the land of
dissidence (<i>bled-es-siba</i>).”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a>
<br>
<br>
The Berber case is instructive for two reasons. First, Gellner makes it
abundantly clear that the demarcation line between Arab and Berber is not,
essentially, one of civilization, let alone religion. Instead, it is a political line
distinguishing the subjects of a state from those outside its control. Assuming,
as Gellner does, historical movement back and forth across this divide,
what becomes intriguing is that a distinction in political status is ethnically
coded as if it were a fundamental difference in kinds of people and not a political
choice. It means that all those who had reason to flee state power, for
whatever reason, were, in a sense, tribalizing themselves. Ethnicity and tribe
began, by definition, where sovereignty and taxes ended. The ethnic zone
was feared and stigmatized by state rhetoric precisely because it was beyond
its grasp and therefore an example of defiance and an ever-present temptation
to those who might wish to evade the state.<br>
<br>
Gellner’s analysis of Berber-Arab relations is also noteworthy as a long
overdue corrective to what might be called “the view from the valley” or
“the view from the state center.” On that view the “barbarian periphery”
is a diminishing remnant, drawn sooner or later and at varying speeds into
the light of Arab civilization. In Southeast Asia and the Maghreb this view
gains credibility because, in the past century, the ungoverned periphery has
increasingly been occupied by the modern nation-state. Up until then, <b>(p.31)</b> 
however, the view from the valley- the idea of a luminous and magnetic center
aligning and drawing in peripheral peoples like so many iron filings-is, at
the very least, half wrong. Up until then a life outside the state was both
more available and more attractive. Oscillation rather than one-way traffic
was the rule. If the account elaborated here emphasizes state avoidance, it
is not because that is the whole truth. Rather, it is the largely untold story
that has unfortunately had no legitimate place in the hegemonic narrative of
civilization, despite its historical importance.<br>
<br>
This model of symbiosis and opposition, of political choice and geographical
facilitation, is, roughly speaking, applicable to the historical relationship
between hill peoples and valley states in mainland Southeast Asia.
In Southeast Asia, as in the Maghreb, the distinction between the “governed”
and the “ungoverned” is an apparent social fact, but it is even more firmly
installed in linguistic usage and popular consciousness. Depending on the
particular cultural context, the connotations of the pairs “cooked” and “raw,”
“tame” and “wild,” “valley people” and “hill people” carry the same weight
as <i>makhazen</i> and <i>siba</i>-that is to say, “governed” and “ungoverned.” The
linkage between being civilized and being a subject of the state is so taken for
granted that the terms <i>subject peoples</i> on the one hand or <i>self-governing peoples</i> 
on the other capture the essential difference.<br>
<br>
The classical states of Southeast Asia were, as in the Middle East, ringed
by relatively free communities: by nonstate spaces and peoples. Such autonomous
peoples lived not only in the hills but also in the marshes, swamps,
mangrove coasts, and labyrinthine waterways of estuarial regions. This marginal
population represented, at one and the same time, an indispensable
trading partner of valley kingdoms, a zone of refuge from state power, a zone
of relative equality and physical mobility, a source of slaves and subjects for
valley states, and an ecocultural identity that was nearly a mirror image of
lowland identities. Thus, while our attention here is trained on the uplands of
Zomia, we are, more generally, concerned with the relationship between state
spaces and extrastate spaces. The focus on Zomia as a vast interstate massif,
in particular, arises simply because of its importance as the most significant
complex catchment zone for refugees from state-making projects in the
valleys. The inhabitants of this zone have come, or remained, here largely because
it lies beyond the reach of the state. Here, the geographical expression
<i>Southeast Asia</i>, as conventionally understood as stopping at the borders of
Southeast Asian nations, is again an impediment to our understanding. Over
the past two millennia, Zomia has been peopled by countless migrations of <b>(p.32)</b> 
populations from well beyond its borders-many of them onetime sedentary
cultivators. They have fled west and southward from Han, and occasionally
Tibetan, rule (the Tai, the Yao/Mien, the Hmong/Miao, the Lahu, and the
Akha/Hani) or northward from Thai and Burman rule. Their geographic
location is a political, cultural, and, often, military decision.<br>
<br>
I argue further that hill peoples cannot be understood in isolation, say,
as tribes, but only relationally and positionally vis-à-vis valley kingdoms.
Ethnic distinctions and identity in the hills are not only quite variable over
time but also usually encode a group’s relative position vis-a-vis state authority.
There are, I would hazard, hardly “tribes” at all, except in this limited
relational sense of the word. The subsistence practices, the choice of
crops to grow, are, by the same token, selected largely with an eye to how
they facilitate or thwart state appropriation. Finally, as noted earlier, even the
social structures and residence patterns in the hills may be usefully viewed
as political choices vis-a-vis state power. Certain egalitarian social structures
reflect, I believe, a Southeast Asian variant of Berber practice: “Divide that
ye be not ruled.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a>
 Far from being sociological and cultural givens, lineage
practices, genealogical reckoning, local leadership patterns, household structures,
and perhaps even the degrees of literacy have been calibrated to prevent
(and in rare cases to facilitate} incorporation in the state.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a>
 A bold case
along these lines is subject to many qualifications and exceptions. I venture
it, nevertheless, not simply to be provocative but because it seems so much
more in keeping with the evidence than the older traditions of relatively self-contained
hill tribes left behind by civilization and progress.<br>
<br>
Toward an Anarchist History of Mainland Southeast Asia<br>
<br>
What blocks a clear view of the peoples of mainland Southeast Asia for most
of their history is the state: classical, colonial, and independent. While a
state-centric view of, say, the past fifty years might be justified, it represents
a gross distortion of earlier periods. The earlier the period, the greater the
distortion. For most of its history, Southeast Asia has been marked by the
relative absence even of valley states. Where they arose, they tended to be remarkably
short-lived, comparatively weak outside a small and variable radius
of the court center, and generally unable systematically to extract resources
(including manpower) from a substantial population. Indeed, <i>interregna</i>, far
from being uncommon, . were more protracted than <i>regna</i>, and, before the
colonial period, a welter of petty principalities allowed much of the <b>(p.33)</b> 
population to shift their residences and loyalties to their advantage or to move to a
zone of no sovereignty or of mutually canceling sovereignties.<br>
<br>
Where and when they did exist, the states of mainland Southeast Asia
lurched from solicitous measures designed to attract subjects to those designed
to capture them and extract as much grain and labor as possible.
Manpower was the key. Even in those cases where the bulk of the crown’s
revenue derived from trade, that revenue was ultimately dependent on the
state’s ability to mobilize the manpower to hold and defend an advantageous
position along trade routes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a>
 The state was tyrannical, but episodically so.
Physical flight, the bedrock of popular freedom, was the principal check on
state power. As we shall see in some detail, subjects who were sorely tried by
conscription, forced labor, and taxes would typically move away to the hills or
to a neighboring kingdom rather than revolt. Given the vagaries of war, succession
struggles, crop failures, and monarchical delusions of grandeur, such
crises of state-building were unpredictable but, sooner or later, inevitable.<br>
<br>
Earlier debates over the writing of Southeast Asian history were about
how the history of states should be written-not about whether states should
have been the center of attention in the first place. Thus scholars criticized
Georges Coedès’s <i>Indianized States of Southeast Asia</i> for missing the purposeful
importation and adaptation of Indian cosmology in the court centers of
Southeast Asia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a>
 To the distortions of Indian-centric histories were added,
later, Eurocentric colonial histories in which the local societies were observed
from “the deck of a ship, the ramparts of the fortress, the high gallery of the
trading house.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a>
 The call was subsequently issued for an “autonomous” history
of Southeast Asia that might avoid both distortions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a>
 And yet until very
recently indeed, virtually all the responses to that call have themselves been
histories, however learned and original, of the Southeast Asian <i>state</i>.<br>
<br>
Why this should be so, why the histories of states should have so persistently
insinuated themselves in the place that might have been occupied by a
history of <i>peoples</i>, merits reflection. The reason, in a nutshell, I believe, is that
state centers, even the tenuous and evanescent Indic-style classical states, are
the political units that leave the most concentrated volume of physical evidence.
The same is the case for sedentary agricultural settlements, characteristic
of state centers. While they are not necessarily any more complex than
foraging or swiddening societies, they are far denser- in the case of irrigated
rice, one hundred times denser-than foraging societies, and hence they
leave far more concentrated rubble in the form of middens, artifacts, building
materials, and architectural ruins.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a>
 The larger the pile of rubble you leave <b>(p.34)</b> 
behind, the larger your place in the historical record! The more dispersed,
mobile, egalitarian societies regardless of their sophistication and trading networks,
and despite being often more populous, are relatively invisible in the
historical record because they spread their debris more widely.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a>
<br>
<br>
The same logic applies with a vengeance once it comes to the written
record. Much of what we know about the classical states of Southeast Asia
comes from the stone inscriptions and, later, paper trails they left behind in
the form of land grants, memorials, tax and corvée records, religious donations,
and court chronicles?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a>
 The thicker the paper trail you leave behind,
the larger your place in the historical record. With the written record, the
distortions also multiply. The traditional words in Burmese and Thai for history,
<i>yazawin</i> and <i>phonesavadan</i>, respectively, both literally mean “the history
of rulers” or “chronicle of kings.” It becomes difficult, in this context, to
reconstruct the life-world of nonelites, even if they are located at the court
center. They typically appear in the record as statistical abstractions: so many
laborers, so many conscripts, taxpayers, padi planters, so many bearers of
tribute. Rarely do they appear as historical actors, and when they do, as in the
case of a suppressed revolt, you can be sure that something has gone terribly
wrong. The job of peasants, you might say, is to stay out of the archives.<br>
<br>
Hegemonic histories centered on courts and capital cities introduce
other distortions as well. They are, forcibly, histories of “state spaces”; they
neglect or ignore altogether both “nonstate spaces” beyond their reach and
the long periods of dynastic decline or collapse when there is hardly a state at
all. In a truly evenhanded, year-by-year, chronology of precolonial, mainland
Southeast Asian states, most of the pages would be blank. Are we to pretend,
along with the official chronicles, that because there was no dynasty in
control, there was no history? Beyond the problem of blank pages, however,
the nature of the official histories of the court center systematically exaggerates
the power, the coherence, and the majesty of the dynasty.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a>
 The court
documents that survive are largely tax and land records on the one hand
and hymns of praise, assertions of power, and claims to legitimacy on the
other; the latter are meant to persuade and to amplify power, not to report
facts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a>
 If we take the cosmological bluster emanating from the court centers
as indicative of facts on the ground, we risk, as Richard O’Connor has noted,
“impos[ing] the imperial imaginings of a few great courts on the rest of the
region.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a>
<br>
<br>
The independent nations of mainland Southeast Asia add a new layer
of historical mystification. As the successor states, ethnically and <b>(p.35)</b> 
geographically, to the classical kingdoms, they have their own interest in embellishing
the glory, continuity, and beneficence of their ancestors. Furthermore, the
histories of the classical states have been mined and distorted in the interest
of identifying a protonation and a protonationalism that could be of use
against contemporary enemies, both foreign and domestic. Thus early artifacts
such as Dong Son drums (large bronze ceremonial objects dating from
roughly 500 BCE to the beginning of the common era and found throughout
highland Southeast Asia and southern China) or local uprisings have been
appropriated as national and/or ethnic achievements when, at the time, such
identities made no sense at all. The result is an historical fable that projects
the nation and its dominant people backward, obscuring discontinuity, contingency,
and fluid identities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a>
 Such accounts serve, as Walter Benjamin reminded
us, to naturalize the progression and necessity of the state in general
and the nation-state in particular.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a>
<br>
<br>
The inadequacies of mandala, dynastic, capital-city, text-based histories
are so manifest, even when read skeptically, that they are chiefly useful
as self-interested descriptions and cosmological claims. During the greater
part of the historical record, and especially in the uplands, there was no state
or “hardly-a-state.” What states there were tended to be personal creations
that were tenuous and fragmented, and that seldom outlasted their founder
by long. Their cosmological claims and ideological reach were far greater than
their practical control over human labor and grain.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a>
<br>
<br>
Here it is crucial to distinguish the “hard” power of the state from its
economic and symbolic influence, which was far wider. The precolonial state,
when it came to extracting grain and labor from subject populations, could
project its power only within a fairly small radius of the court, say, three hundred
kilometers, and that undependably and only during the dry season. The
economic reach of the precolonial state, on the other hand, was far wider but
based on voluntary exchange. The higher the value and smaller the weight
and volume of the commodity (think silk and precious gems as opposed to
charcoal or grain), the greater the reach. The symbolic reach of the state-its
regalia, titles, costumes, its cosmology-traveled far and wide as ideas that
have left a deep impression in the hills, even as they were often deployed in
revolts against valley kingdoms. While the valley kingdom’s hard power was
a minute fraction of its expansive imperial imaginings, its reach as a market
of physical or, especially, symbolic commodities was far greater.<br>
<br>
What if we replaced these “imperial imaginings” with a view of Southeast
Asian history as dominated by long periods of normative and <b>(p.36)</b> 
normalized statelessness, punctuated by occasional, and usually brief, dynastic states
that, when they dissolved, left in their wake a new deposit of imperial imaginings?
In a critique of overly state-centric histories, Anthony Day points us
in just this direction: “What would the history of Southeast Asia look like,
however, if we were to take the turbulent relations between families as normative
rather than a departure from the norm of the absolutist state which
must ‘deal with disorder’?”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
<br>
<br>
The Elementary Units of Political Order<br>
<br>
Abandoning the tunnel vision of the court-state view, as urged by Day and
O’Connor and actually pursued some considerable distance by Keith Taylor,
we attempt an account of the elementary units of political order in mainland
Southeast Asia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a>
 I emphasize the term <i>political order</i> to avoid conveying the
mistaken impression that outside the realm of the state lay mere disorder. Depending
on the location and date, such units might range from nuclear families
to segmentary lineages, bilateral kindreds, hamlets, larger villages, towns
and their immediate hinterlands, and confederations of such towns. Confederations 
appear to constitute the most complex level of integration that had
any stability at all. They consisted of small towns located on terrain favorable
to wet-rice cultivation, with its concentration of population, together with an
allied population in the adjacent hills. Alliances of such “wet-rice archipelagoes”
were common, although they too were short-lived and their constituent
members rarely surrendered their freedom of action. Traces of these patterns
survive in place names throughout the entire region: Xishuang Banna
(”twelve village rice fields”) in Yunnan, Sipsong Chutai (”twelve Tai lords”)
along the Vietnamese-Laotian border and Negri Sembilan (”nine realms”)
in western Malaysia, and Ko Myo (”nine towns”) in Burma’s Shan states. In
this respect, the largest quasi-permanent building blocks in the region were
the Malay <i>negeri/ Negara</i>, the Tai <i>muang</i>, and the Burmese <i>main</i>(???), each
of which represented a potential fund of manpower and grain, located, in the
most favorable cases, athwart a valuable trade route.<br>
<br>
Assembling such potential nodes of power into a political and military
alliance was itself a small, and usually evanescent, miracle of statecraft.
Bringing many such units together under central rule was exceptionally rare
and normally short-lived. When the political confection it represented disintegrated,
it tended to fragment into its constituent units: the petty statelets,
small villages, hamlets, and lineages. New agglomerations might arise, <b>(p.37)</b> 
orchestrated by a new and ambitious political entrepreneur, but they were
always a contingent alliance of the same elementary units. The symbolic and
ideological format for state-making was known and observed by ambitious
local leaders with even the slightest pretense to wider power. State mimicry-what
I have called cosmological bluster-was copied from the Chinese or
Indic high forms, with rudimentary materials and in miniature, right down
to the most petty village chiefs.<br>
<br>
If larger political units were radically unstable, the elementary units
themselves were hardly timeless blocks of building material. We must see
these units themselves as in almost constant motion: dissolving, splitting, relocating,
merging, and reconstituting. The households and individuals within
a hamlet or lineage were themselves in motion over time. A settlement might
remain in place over, say, half a century, but because of residents coming and
leaving, their linguistic and ethnic identification might shift dramatically.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a>

Here demography played a central role, the population density in Southeast
Asia being, in 1600, one-sixth that of India and one-seventh that of China.
The existence of an open frontier operated like an automatic brake on what
the state could extract. Motivated by factors as disparate as epidemics, famines,
taxes, corvée labor, conscription, factional conflict, religious schism,
shame, scandal, and the desire to change one’s luck, it was relatively simple
for households and entire villages to move. Thus, over time, the membership
of any elementary unit was in flux, as was the very existence of the unit itself.
If there was an element of stability here, it resided in the ecology and geography
of places favorable to human settlements. A well-watered plain situated
on a navigable river or a trade route might occasionally be abandoned, but it
was just as likely to be reinhabited when conditions permitted. Such locations
were, of course, the typical cores of the negeri, the muang, the main.<br>
<br>
Fluid as they were, these elementary units were the only building
blocks available to the would-be state-maker. In the absence of an ambitious
strongman, or when the wider polity inevitably shattered, the “remains” were
once again the elementary units. Is an intelligible history possible under such
circumstances? I believe that it is, although it is surely not a dynastic history.
The units in question do have a history, do observe a rough logic in formation,
combination, and dissolution, and do exhibit a certain autonomy vis-a-vis dynastic
or modern states. They have a history, but that history is on a different
plane from state or dynastic history. For all their fluidity, they are the relatively
constant features of the landscape, while the successful dynastic state is
rare and ephemeral. The contingency of the “state” invites us to treat it less <b>(p.38)</b> 
as a unity than as a “complex web of contractual mutualities.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a>
 For when
it does splinter, as Akin Rabibhadana observed about the early nineteenth-century
Siamese state, “the component parts of the system tended to split off
in order to save their own lives.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a>
<br>
<br>
Making sense of innumerable small units, seemingly in constant movement,
might seem impossible. It is surely more daunting than dynastic history,
but we are not without guidance from those who have sought to understand
comparable systems. In the case of Southeast Asia, there are many
studies of social structure that seek to grasp the logic behind the fluidity.
First, most famous, and most controversial among them is Edmund Leach’s
<i>Political Systems of Highland Burma</i>. Subsequent work along these lines in
the highlands, not to mention studies of the Malay world, where shifting
petty states, a mobile population, and a distinction between upstream and
downstream, unruled and ruled populations also is at work, is richly suggestive.
Beyond Southeast Asia, however, we may look again to the encounter
between states and nomadic, stateless populations in the Middle East. The
case for beginning with the elementary unit of the household and treating
villages, tribes, and confederations as provisional and shaky alliances has also
been used to brilliant effect for eighteenth-century North American society
in the Great Lakes region by Richard White.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a>
 And, finally, we may profitably
look back to Thucydides’ <i>Peloponnesian War</i>, which describes a world of
peoples, some with kings, some without, whose fickle loyalties and unreliable
cohesion is a source of constant anxiety to the statesmen of each of the major
antagonists: Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Syracuse-each of them, in turn,
a confederation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a>
<br>
<br>
One challenge for a non-state-centric history of mainland Southeast
Asia consists in specifying the conditions for the aggregation and disaggregation
of its elementary units. The problem has been succinctly put by one
observer of a somewhat comparable flux between states and their autonomous
hinterlands: “There comes a time when one realizes that one is dealing, really,
with molecules which sometimes unify in the form of a vague confederation,
sometimes, just as easily, disaggregate. Even their names offer no consistency
or certainty.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a>
 If the fluidity of the molecules themselves is an inconvenience
for anthropologists and historians, imagine the problem it poses for the dynastic
official or would-be state-builder, the colonial official, and the modern
state functionary. State rulers find it well nigh impossible to install an effective 
sovereignty over people who are constantly in motion, who have no permanent
pattern of organization, no permanent address, whose leadership is <b>(p.39)</b> 
ephemeral, whose subsistence patterns are pliable and fugitive, who have few
permanent allegiances, and who are liable, over time, to shift their linguistic
practices and their ethnic identity.<br>
<br>
And this is just the point! The economic, political, and cultural organization
of such people is, in large part, a strategic adaptation to avoid incorporation
in state structures. These adaptations are all the more feasible
in the mountainous hinterlands of state systems: that is to say, in places like
Zomia.

<blockquote>Here [Sumatra] I am the advocate of despotism. The strong arm of power is
necessary to bring men together, and to concentrate them into societies. . . .
Sumatra is, in great measure, peopled by innumerable petty tribes, subject to
no general government. . . . At present people are as wandering in their habits
as the birds of the air, and until they are congregated and organized under
something iike authority, nothing can be done with them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a>
</blockquote>

In the early nineteenth century, as in the classical mainland states, Sir Stamford
Raffles, quoted above, understood that the precondition of colonial rule
was the concentration of population and sedentary agriculture. He required
a nonfugitive people whose labor and production were legible and hence appropriable
by the state. We turn our attention next, then, to an understanding
of the logic and dynamics behind the creation of state spaces in mainland
Southeast Asia.<br>

16. The colonial and early postcolonial regimes, like the classical states, had considered these areas <i>terra nullius</i> or <i>inutile</i> as in the traditional distinction between <i>La France utile</i> and <i>La France inutile</i> in the sense that they did not repay the costs of administration in terms of grain or revenue. Though forest and hill products might be valuable and though their populations might be captured as slaves, they were considered to lie well outside the directly administered, profitable grain core on which state power and revenue depended. These areas were, under colonialism, typically governed by so-called indirect rule, whereby traditional authorities were supervised and made tributary rather than replaced. Under Han administration from the Yuan Dynasty through much of the Ming, such zones were governed as we shall see under the tusi system, a Chinese form of indirect rule.<br>

Analogies to the Pashtuns, Kurds, and Berbers are less apposite because, in these three cases, the people in question have-or better, are assumed to have-a common culture.

I borrow the term from Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán, who argues that much of the postconquest indigenous population of Spanish America could be found “in areas that are particularly hostile or inaccessible to human movement” and marginal to the colonial economy. For the most part, he has in mind rugged mountainous areas, although he includes tropical jungles and deserts. Aguirre Beltrán tends to see such areas more as “survivals” of precolonial populations rather than environments to which populations fled or were pushed. <i>Regions of Refuge</i>, Society of Applied Anthropology Monograph Series, 12 (Washington, D.C., 1979), 23 and passim.<br>

47. Michaud, <i>Historical Dictionary</i>, 180, quotation from 199.

This implies that montagnards have always been on the run.” Michaud, <i>Turbulent Times and Enduring Peoples</i>, 11.<br>

55. The term <i>mandala</i>, borrowed from south India, describes a political landscape of court centers radiating power outward through alliances and charisma, but having no fixed frontiers. It is an inherently plural term in the sense that it conjures up a number of contending mandalas jockeying for tribute and allies, with each mandala’s sway waxing and waning-or disappearing altogether-depending on the circumstances.

<br>
56. Scholarship on Southeast Asia as a whole is far less guilty of this charge than, say, scholarship on India or China. As a crossroads and contact zone, the borrowing and adaptations of religious beliefs, symbols of authority, and forms of political organization that originated elsewhere could hardly be overlooked. Mandala elites themselves flaunted such trappings. The “hill effects” on valley culture and social organization, however, are typically ignored.<br>

57. The cases of the Minagkabau and the Batak on Sumatra, who long cultivated irrigated rice and developed an elaborate culture but did not create states, reminds us that while irrigated rice is nearly always a precondition of state formation, it is not sufficient.<br>
<br>
58. The same process is roughly applicable, it seems, to our understanding of the formation of the Han system at a much earlier period.<br>

66. The stripping down of social structure to simpler, minimal forms, just as the resort to variable and mobile subsistence practices and fluid identities, has been shown to enhance adaptability to a capricious natural and political environment. See in this connection Robert E. Ehrenreich, Carole L. Crumley, and Janet E. Levy, eds., <i>Heterarchy and the Analysis of Complex Societies</i>, Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Society, no. 6 (1995).<br>
<br>
67. This point is missed, I think, in the perennial debates about whether Southeast Asian classical states were more dependent on trade or on manpower. A positional advantage at a river junction, a mountain pass, a jade or ruby mine had to be held militarily against rival claimants.<br>

72. Compared with other cultural zones, the maritime states of Southeast Asia, located at or near the estuary of rivers, left little in the way of physical evidence behind. The long search for the remains of Srivijaya is perhaps the most striking case in point. See in this context Jean Michaud, <i>Historical Dictionary</i>, 9, who notes that both building materials and burial practices in the hills leave little in the way of archaeological traces. In this connection it should be added that, even in the lowlands, commoners were often forbidden to build structures with brick stone, or even teak, lest it become a potential fortification in a rebellion. Hjorleifur Jonsson: personal communication, June 6, 2007.<br>
<br>
73. The obverse of this fact is that a kingdom that does not leave a paper trail is unlikely to appear in the record at all. Georges Condominas notes that the Lua’ kingdom(s) of highland and Khmer Southeast Asia, despite leaving ruins and oral legends of its founding by the marriage of a Lawa king and a Mon queen who brought Buddhism to the hills, has left hardly a trace because it apparently had no writing system. <i>From Lawa to Mon, from Saa’ to Thai: Historical and Anthropological Aspects of Southeast Asian Social Spaces</i>, trans.

74. Such chronicles do, then, the symbolic work of the state. I am indebted to Indrani Chatterjee for pointing this out to me.<br>
<br>
75. One major exception is found in the Burmese <i>Sit-tans</i>, administrative records that are devoted largely to providing an inventory of taxable property and economic activity and population according to their tax status. See Frank N. Trager and William J. Koenig, with the assistance of Yi Yi, <i>Burmese Sit-tans, 1784-1826: Records of Rural Life and Administration</i>, Association of Asian Studies monograph no. 36 (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1979).<br>

A telling example is the official Burmese court version of a diplomatic letter from the Chinese emperor in which it appears that the Chinese emperor as the emperor of the East is addressing the Burmese king as the emperor of the West and that the two are coequals bestriding the civilized world. As Than Tun remarks, “In all probability, this Burmese version of the address from China is quite different from its original though it is the one acceptable to the Burmese king who admits no other monarch as his superior.” <i>Royal Orders of Burma, A.D. 1598-1885</i>, part I, <i>A.D. 1598-1648</i>, ed. Than Tun (Kyoto: Center for Southeast Asian Studies, 1983), 3: 1. Official court histories remind me of my high school newspaper, <i>The Sun Dial</i>, whose motto was “We Mark Only the Hours That Shine.”<br>

77. One of the first efforts to correct this myopia may be found in Taylor, “Surface Orientations.” It should be noted that the important work of demystifying nationalist histories is, finally, well under way in Southeast Asia.<br>

Milner (Singapore: Institute for Southeast Asian Studies, 1986), 1-22. Bronson makes a related point that the northern two-thirds of South Asia has, over the past three millennia, produced “exactly two moderately durable, region-spanning states: the Gupta and the Mughal. Neither of these nor any of the smaller states lasted longer than two centuries and anarchical interregna were everywhere prolonged and severe.” Bennett Bronson, “The Role of Barbarians in the Fall of States,” in <i>The Collapse of Ancient States and Civilizations</i>, ed.

Such continual and steady movement and change make the region difficult to characterize, though we can note three constants: village affiliation, strong traditions of independence, and freedom of movement.”<br>
