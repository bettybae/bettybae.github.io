			case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<b>Art Spiegelman</b> (1948 ~) is a Jewish American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate. He is best known for graphic novel <i>Maus Ⅰ: A Survivor’s Tale: My Father Bleeds History</i> (1986) and <i>Maus Ⅱ: And Here My Troubles Began</i> (1991). Spiegelman was born in Stockholm, but soon moved to United States and spent his early life in Rego Park, New York. He started to gain prominence in the underground comix scene in the 1960s, which were presented in the collection <i>Breakdowns</i> in 1977. Afterwards, Spiegelman focused on creating a long narrative comic book about Holocaust experience which led to the publication of Maus; the first half of Maus in 1986 and the second in 1991. [1] Maus illustrate both the remembrance and trauma of Holocaust from second generation Jew’s point of view (Art Spiegelman) and memoirs of his father who survived in the massacre (Vladek Spiegelman). [2] One of the most striking features of the series is that each race is represented in different animals; Jews as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, and so on. The series are considered crucial as it brought attention to the medium; establishing storytelling via comic book as a sophisticated adult medium. He received National Book Critics Circle Nominations and the Special Pulitzer Prize in 1992. Maus has been published in twenty different languages.

			case 3: $("div#commentary").html(' Selections about <b>Birkenau</b> Max Hastings, <i>Inferno: The World at War, 1939-1945</i>(2011)<br><br>"In Europe, meanwhile, an estimated 20 million people were displaced from their prewar homes, often in circumstances of terrible hardship. One evening in 1940, Szmulek Goldberg, a Jew from L6di, took his girlfriend, Rose, to the nearby sports club where they had spent many happy hours. It was now bomb damaged and shuttered. They wandered into the derelict gymnasium where Szmulek once won a dance contest, partnering his mother. "I had dressed in my flashy clothes and brown felt hat for the last time. We stopped and I turned to Rose. 'My name is Szmulek Goldberg,' I said in a formal, introductory tone. 'My name is Rose,' she replied, her eyes glistening with moisture. I bowed to her and she curtsied in return. We waltzed through the stillness to music we heard only in our hearts." That night, amid Rose's sobs and a long embrace, Szmulek said his fare- Victims 483 wells. He fled L6di and survived-but spent the last years of the war in Auschwitz-Birkenau. He never saw his girl again." (482, from Szmulek Goldberg, <i>IWM 06/52/1</i><br><br>"The Holocaust is today often discussed in isolation. In one sense, this is logical, because the Jews were singled out for genocide, but the records of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the most notorious of the death camp complexes, emphasise the numbers from other racial groups who shared the fate of Jewish deportees. The best available statistics show that a total of 1.1 million Jews arrived at the camp, of whom 100,000 survived; among 140,000 non-Jewish Poles, half survived; of 23,000 gypsies, all but 2,000 perished; all of the 15,000 Soviet POW s died; about half of 25,000 others-mosdy political prisoners-were killed. In addition to almost 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis, over 3 million Russians died in German captivity, while huge numbers of non-Jewish civilians were massacred in Russia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and other occupied countries." (486)<br><br>"MANY GREAT TESTIMONIES by victims of the Holocaust have been preserved, but one of the most astonishing was revealed to the world only sixty years after its author's death. Irene Nemirovsky was born in Kiev in 1903, the daughter of a rich banker who had translated himself from the Ukrainianghettos and pogroms to a large mansion in St. Petersburg. She grew up in lonely luxury, travelling regularly with her family to France. They fled the revolution in 1917, enduring considerable hardships before reaching Paris two years later, where her father rebuilt his fortune. Irene had been writing since she was fourteen. In 1927, she published her first novella; by the outbreak of war she was an established French literary figure, author of nine novels, one of which had been filmed, and married with two daughters. In 1940, when the Germans occupied Paris, she retreated to a rented house in the village of Issy-I'Eveque, in Saone-et-Loire. There, in the following year, she embarked upon what she intended to become a trilogy about the war, on the epic scale of War and Peace. She had few illusions about her own likely fate, and wrote despairingly in 1942: "Just let it be over-one way or the other!" Though she had converted to Catholicism, there was no escape from the Nazi blight upon her race: on 13 July she was arrested by French police and deported to Auschwitz, to be murdered at Birkenau on 17 August. Her husband was killed shortly afterwards." (505~506)<br><br>"From 1943 onwards, however, prisoner mortality declined sharply. Even some Jews were kept alive, notably as workers at the huge IG Farben complex beside Auschwitz-Birkenau. The major Holocaust killings, save those of Hungary's Jews, were already completed. Foreign workers and slaves never provided a wholly satisfactory substitute labour force-they were thought to underperform their German counterparts by at least 15 percent, perhaps as much as 30 percent. It was a folly, as well as a barbarity, to suppose that starved and brutalised slave labourers could achieve as much useful productivity as those treated with minimal humanity. The concentration camp system, which the SS sought to make a profit centre, was inefficient even on its own terms, but slave labour alone made it possible for Germany to continue the war until 1945." (489~490, from Adam Tooze, <i>The Wages of Destruction</i>[2007],537).'); break;

(Time Flies?<br>
A: Vladek died of congestive heart failure on August 18, 1982?Francoise and I stayed with him in the Catskills back in August 1979. Vladek started working as a tinman in Auschwitz in the spring of 1944?I started working on this page at the very end of February 1987. In May 1987 Francoise and I are expecting a baby?Between May 16, 1944 and May 24, 1944 over 100,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed in Auschwitz? In September 1986, after 8 years of work, the first part of MAUS was published. It was a critical and commercial success. At least fifteen foreign editions are coming out. I've gotten 4 serious offers to turn my book into a T.V. special or movie. (I don't wanna.) In May 1968 my mother killed herself. (She left no note.) Lately I've been feeling depressed.
<br>B: Alright, Mr. Spiegelman?We're ready to shoot! ...Tell our viewers what message you want them to get from your book?
<br>A: A message? I dunno?I-I never thought of reducing it to a message. I mean, I wasn't trying to CONVINCE anybody of anything. I just wanted-
<br>C: Your book is being translated into German?Many younger Germans have had it up to HERE with Holocaust stories. These things happened before they were even born. Why should THEY feel guilty?
<br>A: Who am I to say?... But a lot of the corporations that flourished in Nazi Germany are richer than ever. I dunno?Maybe everyone has to feel guilty. EVERYONE! FOREVER!
<br>D: Okay?Let's talk about Israel꿌f your book was about ISRAELI Jews, what kind of animal would you draw?
<br>A: I have no idea?porcupines?
<br>E: Excuse me꾿rtie, baby. Check out this licensing deal. You get 50% of the profits. We'll make a million. Your dad would be proud! 
<br>A: Huh?
<br>E: So, whaddya WANT - a bigger percentage? Hey, we can talk.
<br>A: I want ABSOLUTION. No꿓o꿌 want꿌 want꿲y MOMMY!
<br>B: Could you tell our audience if drawing MAUS was cathartic? Do you feel better now?
<br>A: WAH!
<br>A: whew. They're gone. Sometimes I just don't feel like a functioning adult. I can't believe I'm gonna be a father in a couple of months.
<br>(Nadja Mouly Spiegelman born 5/13/87) 
<br>My father's ghost still hangs over me. It's 9:30pm already. I've gotta head uptown for my appointment with Pavel. 
<br>(Pavel is my shrink. He sees patients at night. He's a Czech Jew, a survivor of Terezin and Auschwitz. I see him once a week. His place is overrun with stray dogs and cats. Can I mention this, or does it completely loose up my metaphor?)
<br>F: Hi Art. Come on in. So, how are you feeling?
<br>A: Completely messed up. I mean, things couldn't be going better with my "career," or at home, but mostly I feel like crying. I can't work. My time is being sucked up by interviews and business propositions I can't deal with. But even when I'm left alone I'm totally BLOCKED. Instead of working on my book I just lie on my couch for hours and stare at a small grease spot on the upholstery. 
<br>(Framed photo of pet cat. Really!) 
<br>Somehow my arguments with my father have lost a little of their urgency?and Auschwitz just seems too scary to think about?so I just LIE there?
<br>F: It sounds like you're feeling remorse-maybe you believe you exposed your father to ridicule.
<br>A: Maybe. But I tried to be fair and still show how angry I felt.
<br>F: Even so, EVERY body when he's little, looks up to his father.
<br>A: That sounds true, but it's hard for me to remember꿒ainly I remember ARGUING with him?and being told that I couldn't do anything as well as he could.
<br>F: And now that you're becoming successful, you feel bad about proving your father wrong.
<br>A: No matter what I accomplish, it doesn't seem like much compared to surviving Auschwitz.
<br>F: But you weren't in Auschwitz?you were in Rego Park. Maybe your father needed to show that he was always right - that he could always SURVIVE - because he felt GUILTY about surviving. 
<br>A: Maybe.
<br>F: And he took his guilt out on YOU, where it was safe?on the REAL survivor.
<br>A: Um꿚ell me, do you feel any guilt about surviving the camps?
<br>F: No?just sadness. So do you ADMIRE your father for surviving?
<br>A: Well꿺ure. I know there was a lot of LUCK involved, but he WAS amazing present-minded and resourceful?
<br>F: Then you think it's admirable to survive. Does that mean it's NOT admirable to NOT survive?
<br>A: Whoosh. I-I think I see what you mean. It's as if life equals winning, so death equals losing.
<br>F: Yes. Life always takes the side of life, and somehow the victims are blamed. But it wasn't the BEST people who survived, nor did the best ones die. It was RANDOM! Sigh. I'm not talking about YOUR book now, but look at how many books have already been written about the Holocaust. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Holocaust</a>What's the point? People haven't changed?Maybe they need a newer, bigger Holocaust. Anyway, the victims who died can never tell THEIR side of the story, so maybe it's better not to have any more stories. 
<br>A: Uh-huh. Samuel Beckett once said: "Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness."
<br>F: Yes. (? On the other hand, he SAID it.
<br>F: He was right. Maybe you can include it in your book.
<br>A: My book? Hah! What book?? Some part of me doesn't want to draw or think about Auschwitz. I can't visualize it clearly, and I can't BEGIN to imagine what it felt like.
<br>F: What Auschwitz felt like? Hmm?How can I explain?...BOO!
<br>A: YIII!
<br>F: It felt a little like <b>that</b>. But ALWAYS! From the moment you got to the gate until the very end. So, what part of your book are you trying to visualize? My father worked in a tin shop near the camp. I have no idea what kind of tools and stuff to draw. There's no documentation.
<br>F: Let's see. There would be a cutter-like giant paper cutter-and maybe an electric drill press or two.
<br>A: How do you know that?
<br>F: Oh, I worked in a tool and die shop in Czechoslovakia when I was a kid. But it's getting late now, and I still have to walk my dogs.
<br>A: Okay, I'll see you in a week꿆ee. I don't understand exactly why꿣ut these sessions with Pavel somehow make me feel better꿒aybe I could show the tin shop and not draw drill press. I hate to draw machinery.
<br>(And so?
<br>(Recorded voice of Vladek)
<br>꿚hen, when I came out from the hospital, right away she started again that I can change my will! 
<br>Please pop. The tape's on. Let's continue?
<br>I was still so sick and tired. And to have peace only, I agreed. To make it legal she brought right to my bed a notary. 
<br>Let's get back to Auschwitz?
<br>Fifteen dollars he charged to come! If she waited only a week until I was stronger, I'd go to the bank and take a notary for only a quarter!
<br>ENOUGH! Tell me about Auschwitz!))
<br>A: Sigh
<br>(You were telling me how your Kapo tried o get you work as a tinsmith?
<br>Yah. Every day I worked there right outside from the camp?
<br>The chief of the tinmen it was a Russian Jew named Yidl.)
<br>G: Bah! You're no tinsmith. You can't even cut it right.
<br>H: But this is how I've always done it! I've only been a tinsmith for a few years. If you show me how you want it cut I can learn quickly.
<br>G: Hah! You never did an honest day's work in your whole life, Spiegelman! I know all about you?
<br>(I don't know where from he heard stories about me.) 
<br>You owned big factories and exploited your workers, you dirty capitalist! 
<br>(He was a communist, this Yidl.)  
<br>Pfui! They send drek like you here while they send real tinmen up the chimney. Watch out, I've got my eye on you! 
<br>(I was afraid. He could really do me something.)
<br>With the other boys there, I got along fine.
<br>I: Don't worry꿠ou just have to know how to handle Yidl꿁ring him a few eggs, some butter or cheese?You'll see. He'll sing a different tune. 
<br>H: Ha! And where do I get all this food?
<br>I: Just keep your eyes open. You can organize things with the Poles here.
<br>Poles from nearby they hired to work also here-not prisoners, but specialist building workers?
<br>I: (Psst-I can get you a fine gold watch for a pound of sausage and six eggs.)
<br>J: (Agreed.)
<br>They had nothing, only food from their farms. They were happy to make exchanges.
<br>H: The head guy from the Auschwitz laundry was a fine fellow what knew well my family before the war?From him I got civilian clothings to smuggle out below my uniform. I was so thin the guards didn't see if I wore extra. Here Yidl. I've got a big piece of cheese for you.
<br>H: Wait! I need that to pay off the guy who helped me organize the cheese!
<br>G: Hmph.
<br>(He was so greedy, Yidl, he wanted I risk only for him everything. I too had to eat.)
<br>H: Everybody was so hungry always, we didn't know even what we are doing?In the morning for breakfast we got only a bitter drink made from roots. 
<br>(I woke before everybody to have time to the toilet and find still some tea left. One time a day they gave a soup from turnips. To stand near the first of the line was no good. You got only water. Near the end was better-solid things to the bottom floated.)
<br>I: Mix it! Mix it!
<br>(But too far to the end it was also no good.. Because many times it could be no soup anymore. And one time each day they gave to us a small bread, crunchy like glass.)
<br>H: The flour they mixed with sawdust together - we got one little brick of this what had to last the full day. Most gobbled it right away, but I always saved a half for later.
<br>(And in the evening we got a spoiled cheese or jam. If we were lucky a couple times a week we got a sausage big like two of my fingers. Only this much we got. If you ate how they gave you, it was just enough to die more slowly. Each morning and evening they made an appel. They counted the live ones and dead ones to see it wasn't any missing?We stood sometimes the whole night while they counted again and again. On our appels it was one old guy there. Always he was complaining?
<br>I: I don't belong here with all these Yids and Polacks! I'm a GERMAN like you! I have medals from the Kaiser. My son is a German soldier!
<br>(Only they hit him and they laughed.)
<br>A: Was he really a German?
<br>H: Who knows.. It was German prisoners also?But for the Germans this guy was Jewish!
<br>(On one appel he didn't stand so straight and a guard dragged him away. I heard he pushed him down and jumped hard on his neck?or they sent him to the gas, I don't remember, but they finished him and he never anymore complained.)
<br>A: Tell me about mom. Were you in touch with her in Auschwitz.
<br>H: Ya?In the beginning I knew only her number, and that she was there.. in Birkenau. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Birkenau</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Birkenau</a>This I found out by workers from Birkenau what passed where I was teaching English.
<br>A: Where was Birkenau?
<br>H: The camp was a part from Auschwitz?It was maybe 2 miles to go from Auschwitz to Birkenau there it was much more big. In Auschwitz we had, say, 20,000 prisoners, in Birkenau was at least 5 times so many. Auschwitz, it was a camp where they gave you to work so they didn't finish you so fast. Birkenau was even more bad. It was 800 people in a building made for 50 horses. There it was just a death place with Jews waiting for gas?and there it was Anja. Come?It's time now we'll hurry for lunch home to the Bungalow. 
<br>A: So you were actually in touch with Anja in Birkenau?
<br>H: Yah. From Mancie I had a real contact with mother, until later I could bring Anja to-
<br>A: Wait! Who's Mancie?
<br>(She was a Hungarian, Mancie, who worked sometimes there. Beautiful. A tall blonde girl. And clever.)
<br>M: Rest behind that stack of wood. I'll warn you if a guard comes close.
<br>(She had a lover, I heard later. An S.S. man. He got for her a good position over 10 or 12 other girls from Birkenau.)
<br>H: (Psst, miss?up here! I see how kind you are. Help me. Please!)
<br>M: Huh? (What do you want?)
<br>H: (Nothing for me, but I'm afraid for my wife in Birkenau. Can you find out if she's still alive?)
<br>(I told to her Anja's name and number.)
<br>H: (I've saved some food. I can pay for your help.)
<br>M: (Keep your food. We'll be working here again in a few days. I'll see what I can find out.)
<br>(Each day I looked. Four days after, I saw her.)
<br>M: I met a woman named Anja from Sosnowiec. She's very frail?
<br>(She spoke over to one of her workers; I spoke only to my tin so nobody will notice.)
<br>M: Someone told her that her husband is still alive and she started sobbing with joy.
<br>(I heard this, and I started also crying a little. And Mancie, she too started crying.)
<br>(A few days after, Mancie again came there.)
<br>M: I put some "Garbage" under a rock near the doorway.
<br>(She brought to me a letter-a real letter!-from Anja.)
<br>("I miss you." She wrote to me. "Each day I think to run into the electric wires and finish everything. But to know you are alive it gives me still to hope?
<br>(She told me her Kapo was very mean on her and gave work Anja really couldn't do. Like to run from the kitchen with the big cans of soup. Even for me such cans were heavy, and for Anja-she was so small-it was impossible. She couldn't hold well her end. Always she spilled. The Kapo beat Anja very hard but kept her to this job. And if Anja spilled over all from the soup, then nobody got what to eat, especially Anja.)
<br>H: I wrote to her, "I think of you always," and sent with Mancie two pieces of bread. If the S.S. would see she is taking food into the camp, right away they will kill her. But always she took. So she said "If a couple is loving each other so much, I must help however I can."
<br>(Each day I marched to work and hoped again I'll see Mancie?She could have more news of Anja.)
<br>A: I just read about the camp orchestra that played as you marched out the gate?
<br>H: An orchestra?...
<br>(No.1 remember only marching, not any orchestras?From the gate guards took us over to the workshop. How could it be there an orchestra?)
<br>A: I dunno, but it's very well documented?
<br>H: No. At the gate I heard only guards shouting.
<br>A: Did you ever talk with any of the guards?
<br>H: Ach! We were below their dignity. We were not even men. But it was one guy?
<br>(If he spoke of course I answered. He had even a little heart.)
<br>K: Aah. Guten morgen. This spring air reminds me of home?of Nuremburg?
<br>H: Yes. I was there once. It's a beautiful city.
<br>(And if he liked me, maybe someday he won't shoot me. One time he was missing a few days?
<br>H: You looke pale. Were you sick herr soldat?
<br>K: No?I was? Working? In Birkenau.
<br>H: Yes?I've heard about what goes on there?
<br>K: SHUT UP!
<br>(And he was afraid any more to speak.)
<br>H: When I visited to Anja there, I saw with my own eyes how it was?
<br>A: You saw Anja?
<br>(Ya. Every few days it came an S.S. commission to the tin shop...)
<br>K: You have more workers than you need here?Give us 10 prisoners to take back to the main camp for other work. 
<br>G: Well?Take that one?and that one? And-Wait! Don't take him! He's one of my best roofers?Take that one?And that one?
<br>(The unlucky ones wnet over for bad jobs, but me Yidl kept protected.)
<br>K: 꿙end a crew to sector Bib in Birkenau. Some of the roofs in the women's camp have collapsed. 
<br>H: Let me go to Birkenau. I've never seen it.
<br>G: Go, Spiegelman. And don't come back for all I care. Bah! I give up my best tinmen, and you I save. Why?!
<br>(So I marched with a few tinmen over to Birkenau. I came the first time in Summer 1944. Thousands-hundreds of thousands of Hungarians were arriving there at this time. Inside the camp we called out. Maybe somebody knew if our loved ones are here alive.)
<br>??: Eva. Eva Goldberg from Lodz!
<br>??: Anja Zylberberg! From Sosnowiec!
??: My god. That's Vladek! I'll go find Anja!
(I was so happy. Someone brought somehow Anja over. She looked so like a skeleton.)
M: Don't look up darling. A guard may spot us. 
H: Did Mancie bring you my letters?
AN: Yes. And when she can, she gets me jobs in the kitchen! My friends wait outside and I bring them scraps. 
H: No! Save your scraps! What if you lose that job! What if something happens to Mancie? Don't worry about friends. Believe me, they don't worry about you. They just worry about getting a bigger share of your food.
AN: But my friends are always hungry, and I-I don't have much of an appetite.
H: I beg you, Anja-Keep yourself strong. For my sake.
AN: Just seeing you again gives me strength. 
??: I have to go before anyone notices I'm missing.
??: I?I think about you?Always.
(I was a few times in Birkenau, and once I had really troubles. I was going from work and passed by Anja?)
AN: Vladek! Vladek! Vladek!
H: Anja! Darling! Did you get the good I sent you?
AN: Yes. You always arrange miracles.
H: I think about you always.
(We spoke a minute only and I went on my way. A guard screamed to me:)
K: Halt! Who were you talking to?
H: N-nobody?A stranger asked if I knew her brothers in Auschwitz. I didn't know anything, so I hardly answered?
K: Get inside! When I'm finished with you, you'll know something, Jewish pimp! You're not here to flirt and gossip. Count the blows. If you lose count-I'll start again!
H: Eins! Zwei! Drei!
(So he beat me, what can I tell you? Only, thank god, Anja didn't get also such a beating. She wouldn't live.)
H: The next days it was hard to go work, but to go to the hospital, I could easy not come again out. It wasn't a place with medicines, only a place full with prisoners too sick to go work. Each day it was selektions?The doctors chose out the weaker ones to go and die. In the whole cam was selektions. I went two times in from of Dr. Mengele. We stood without anything, straight like a soldier. He glanced and said: "Face left!" They looked to see if it was sores or pimples on the body. Then again: "Face left!" 
(They looked to see if eating no food made you too skinny?
K: Face left!
(If you had still a healthy body to work, they passed you through and gave you another uniform until it came the next selection?When first I came I was very strong then, and came well to the good side. The ones that had not so lucky the S.S. wrote down their number and sent to the other side. The second selektion I was in the barrack. In the bed up from me was a fine boy, a Belgian. 
I: I dreamed my wife was alive. She was cooking a giant roast with thick gravy and fried-
H: Stop, Felix! Don't think about food!
I: We were expecting dinner guests. We waited and waited?Then the gong rang. I woke up without even tasting the-
I: Blocksperre!
(A "Blocksperre," this meant you must not step out from the room.)
H: They took then the Jews to a selektion. I came again to the good side, but this Belgian, he had maybe a rash, and they wrote his number?
(Any time they could take him. All night he cried and screamed.)
I: Aawoowwah!
H: Here Felix. Have a piece of bread?
I: Sob
H: Look. They're going to kill ALL of us here eventually?You this week, me the next?None of us can escape it. You must be brave?And, who knows, maybe it's not even your turn yet?
(So he calmed a little. But later he again started. What could I do? I couldn't tell the Germans they won't take him?And the next day, they took. So?in the tinshop I had still the same story with Yidl.)
G: Only one apple for me today? Is this business bad, Mr. Capitalist?
H: What happened to the shoemaker who worked in there? A lot of Polish prisoners were sent to camps inside the Reich. They took some of my boys too. 
(I ran to the Kapo in charge from all the shop.) <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Kapo</a>
H: Do you need a new shoemaker? 
J: Sure, the S.S. took the old one away, but they're still bringing shoes in! 
H: You know, I've been a shoemaker since childhood.
J: You don't look like a shoemaker to me?You're a tinman!
H: Do I have it written on my forehead?
J: Alright. Then?Fix this!
(I learned a little shoe fixing watching how they worked when I was with my cousin in Miloch, there in the ghetto shoe shop. To fix such an opened sole I knew to take a double thread smeared with wax?Make then a hole and push the thread half way only. And on the upper part put two holes even to the sole?Bring the thread then through these holes. Cross the thread from the top and bottom, both ends through a new hole in the sole and repeat so until the shoe is closed?And so it's made, you can't even see it has stitches! You see? It's good to know how to do everything!)
J: You're better than our last shoemaker!
(So, now I was a shoemaker. I had here a warm and private room where to sit?And here I didn't have anymore to worry will Yidl give me out.)
G: Ha! I knew you were an expert tinman, but I never knew you had so many other talents!
(Officials liked better if <b>I</b> fix their shoes than to send to the big shop inside camp.)
K: This is a new boot. I don't want your repair to show. 
H: It's a bad rip?I'll do my best.
K: If it doesn't look brand new by tomorrow you won't be here anymore. Understand me?
(I knew to fix soles and heels, but what this Gestapo wanted, it needed a specialist. So, going from work, I hid this boot to sneak it to a REAL shoemaker in Auschwitz.)
H: Can you fix this? I'll give you a day's ration of bread.
I: For a day's ration of bread I can fix <i>anything</i>!
(I watched careful how he did, so next time I can save myself such a bread. Next day, I had the boot ready for this Gestapo.)
K: Hmm
(He left the boot and went without one word. And he came back with a whole sausage. You know what this was, a whole sausage? You can't imagine! I cut with a shoe knife and ate so fast I was a little sick after.)
K: You did a good job.
H: I couldn't anymore make a business smuggling with Polish workers from here as a shoemaker, but still I was well-off?The Gestapo what I fixed his boot recommended me, so his friends wanted I'll fix also their shoes and paid me food.
(I shared sometimes to the Kapo in charge. If you want to live, it's good to be friendly.)
H: I just organized some eggs-Want one?
J: What a friendly Jew! Sure-We can cook them on my heater. And here's a little bread for our meal.
H: Great! Say what are all those new buildings they're putting up there?
J: Just some new workshops. They're expanding the union werke munitions factory?And they're putting up some barracks to move some women workers from Birkenau over here.
H: M-My wife is in Birkenau. Maybe I could get her into one of those barracks! 
J: Hah! Impossible! It would cost a fortune in bribes!
(He unwrapped some cheese and ate himself a piece.)
H: Please. Could I have that piece of paper?
J: Well, sure. I can let you have the paper-but not the cheese!
(I needed to write over to Anja!)
H: Even paper was hard to have there. My friends came always to me when they needed. I found and saved. For the toilet most used a piece from their clothes or their hand.
A: Why didn't other people save paper?
H: Ach! You know how most people are!
(So?I wrote over to Anja that now I am a shoemaker, and I heard here about these new barracks?And Mancie took it. She was so good, always she took. On the back from my letter Anja wrote how much she wanted only to come to such a barrack near to me. Anja's barrack was maybe 1000 girls with a bad Kapo what hit anybody what came near.)
J: Sneak! I saw you take a second piece of bread!
AN: No. I-
(She had leather boots-not wood. They were in a very bad shape, but really leather.)
AN: N-Nice boots. It's a pity the soles are coming apart.
J: So? What do you care?
AN: You could send them to my husband. He's a shoemaker in Auschwitz?
J: Oh, really
(So, she arranged the boots over to me.)
H: Of course, I fixed very nice the shoes, and the Kapo then was very different with Anja.
J: That soup can is too heavy for you. Come rest in my room until the Appel.
(꿽ery different. I thought only how happy it would be to have Anja so near to me in these new barracks. It could be "arranged" for 100 cigarettes and a bottle of vodka, but this was a fortune.)
One day's bread = 3 cigarettes
200 cigarettes = 1 bottle of vodka
A: How could you get cigarettes?
H: Each week to the workers, they gave us three.
A: They issued a luxury like that!
H: Ya. And if you don't smoke you can exchange for bread.
(I starved a little to pay to bring Anja over. All what I organized I kept in a box under my mattress. But, when I came back one time from work?
H: It-It's gone!
(I'm telling you I wanted to cry.)
A: You left the box in the barrack? How could it <b>not</b> be taken?
H: I didn't think on it?
A: But everyone was starving to death! Sigh-I guess I just don't understand. 
H: Yes?About Auschwitz, nobody can understand.
(So?I saved a second time a fortune, and gave over bribes to bring Anja close to me. And in the start of October, 1944, I saw a few thousand women in these new barracks?And with them was Anja. <b>This</b> I arranged. It was the only time I was happy in Auschwitz. When nobody saw I went back and forth until I saw her from far going to make munitions?She went also back and forth until it was safe to approach over to my food packages?But one time, it was very bad.)
J: Hey, you! Stop! Drop that package and stop right there! Stop!
(She ran-she didn't know where-into her own block. Only a friend from Anja was there as a room cleaner?
AN: H-Hide me, Lonia, quick!
L: Get under one of the blankets!
J: I know you're in here someplace, and when I find you I'll <b>kill</b> you right here on the spot!
(It was several rooms there, and hundreds of beds. In one, Anja lay shaking, afraid to breathe even.)
J: I'll kill you! Kill you!
(For maybe an hour, like crazy she ran from room to room, throwing upside down the beds.)
J: Bah! Get all the beds in order before the appel.
L: Okay, Anja. It's safe to come out now. 
(But this wasn't over. On the evening appel she came against this Kapo.)
J: The prisoner I chased this afternoon will now step forward!
(But mother didn't step out.)
J: It will be better for you if you step out than if I find you!
(She came back and forth, looking in each face, but with the stripes everyone looked all the same.)
J: If you know who she is, push her forward or you'll all suffer!
(She made them to run, to jump, to bend until they couldn't anymore. Then more, the same. For a few appels it went so, but nobody of Anja's friends gave her out. You can <b>imagine</b> what she went through.)
H: I had to stop sending over such packages more to Anja. I lost anyway my job near to her soon after. My whole workshop they closed out?They put us back to the main camp and took me for <b>black</b> work. 
A: Black work?
(Carrying back and forth big stones, digging out holes, each day different, but always the same. Very hard?And god forbid, if you stopped only a minute to breathe. You got a hit to the head, or worse. To me they never hit, because I worked all my muscles away.)
H: I liked better indoors work. I sometimes was a "Bettnachzieher"?A bed-after-puller?After everybody fixed their bed, we came to fix better, so the straw looked square. 
A: What a crazy job!
H: No. they wanted everything neat and in good order.
(But these days I got too skinny and it came again in a selektion. Now it could be <b>my</b> turn.)
I: Blocksperre!
(Right away I ran inside the toilets. And if somebody looked, I'll tell I had a bad stomach. What had I to lose? Nobody looked, so I sat lucky the whole selektion.)
A: So did you do black work the rest of the time you were in there?
H: I had not again a new chance for a better job. In Auschwitz together I was 10 months.
A: How long were you in quarantine teaching English?
H: Maybe 2 months?There I had it good. I-
A: You told me about that. How many months were you in the tin shop?
H: In this workshop-tin and shoe work combined-I was about 5 or 6 months.
A: So, black work lasted 3 months.
H: Yah?No! I remind myself?After black work I came again as a tinman with Yidl for 2 months. They-
A: But wait! That would be 12 months, you said you were there a total of 10!
H: So? Take less time to the black work. In Auschwitz we didn't wear watches.
Fran: Yoohoo! I was looking for you. I was worried you were gone a long time/
H: You finished then my bank papers?
Fran: Uh-huh. And I made some sandwiches for lunch too.
A: Great! I'm starving!
H: Ach! If you made with white bread, I'm not allowed to eat. Such a good girl-with my <b>special</b> bread she knew to make?Mala wouldn't have done such a good sandwich.
Fran: It was the only bread in the house. Want some tea or coffee?
H: I can make. I have a tea bag near to the sink drying from breakfast.
A: How did you become a tinman again?
H: Mala could go for a whole evening out with her friends and leave for me nothing cooked to eat or drink. <i>Sigh</i>. You see how it is? I have now one more time an unnecessary suffering in my life.
A: So how did you get back into the tin shop?
H: When the Russians came near, the Germans made ready to run from Auschwitz. They needed tinmen to pull apart the machineries of the gas chambers. They wanted to pack it all to Germany. There they could take also all of the Jews to finish them in quiet. The Germans didn't want to leave anywhere a <i>sign</i> of all what they did. You <i>heard</i> about the gas, but I'm telling not <i>rumors</i>, but only what really I saw. 
(For this I was an eyewitness. I came to one of the four cremo buildings. It looked so like a big bakery?From below ground, in the gas room, we tinmen had to take out the pipes and fans for ventilating. This was a factory to make-one, two, three-ashes and smoke from all what came here. Special prisoners worked here separate. They got better bread, but each few months they also were sent up the chimney. One from them showed me everything how it was. People believed <i>really</i> it was here a place for showers. So they were told. They came to a big room to undress their clothes what looks so, yes-here is a place so like they say. If I saw a couple of months before how it was all arranged here, only <i>one</i> time I could see it! And everybody crowded inside into the shower room, the door closed hermetic, and the lights turned dark. It was between 3 and 30 minutes-it depended how much gas they put-but soon was nobody anymore alive.)
Zyklon B, a pesticide, dropped into hollow columns.
(The biggest pile of bodies lay right next to the door where they tried to get out. This guy who worked there, he told me?
I: We pulled the bodies apart with hooks. Big piles, with the strongest on top, older ones and babies crushed below? Often the skulls were smashed?Their fingers were broken from trying to climb up the walls?And sometimes their arms were as long as their bodies, pulled from the sockets.
H: <b>Enough</b>!
(I didn't want more to hear, but anyway he told me. They pulled the bodies with an elevator up to the ovens-many ovens-and to each one they burned 2 or 3 at a time. To <b>such</b> a place finished my father, my sisters, my brothers, so many)
H: What are they doing over there-digging trenches in case the Russians attack?
I: Trenches?Hah! Those are giant <b>graves</b> they're filling in!... It started in May and went on all summer. They brought Jews from Hungary-too many for their ovens, so they dug those big cremation pits.
H: The holes were big, so like the swimming pool of the Pines Hotel here. And train after train of Hungarians came. 
(And those what finished in the gas chambers before they got pushed in these graves, it was the <i>lucky</i> ones. The others had to jump in the graves while still they were alive?Prisoners what worked there poured gasoline over the live ones and dead ones. And the fat from the burning bodies they scooped and poured again so everyone could burn better.)
H: Ach! It's 2:30. Look how the time is flying. And it's still so much to do today?
A: Jesus.
H: It's dishes to clean, dinner to defrost, and my <i>pills</i> I haven't yet counted. 
A: I don't get it꿞hy didn't the Jews at least <i>try</i> to resist?
H: It wasn't so easy like you think. Everyone was so starving and frightened, and tired they couldn't <i>believe</i> even what's in front of their eyes?And the Jews lived always with hope. They hoped the Russians can come before the German bullet arrived from the gun into their head and-Oops! (Crash!) Oi! You see how my head is? It's my favorite dish now broken!
A: It's only a dish!... But why didn't they try to take just one Nazi with them? 
H: In some spots people <i>did</i> fight?But you can kill maybe one German before they kill fast a hundred from you. Then it's <i>everyone<i> dead?An this way it was also everyone dead. Nu? Don't throw it away! I can glue still together that plate.
A: I guess I'll do the dishes now.
H: No. You can defrost out the turkey legs?You only would break me the rest of my plates.
That night?
A: Whew. He's asleep at last!
Fran: It's amazing how hard it is to spend a whole day with him. He just radiates so much tension. Poor guy. I guess he's worse than usual because of Mala?
A: Nah, he's always that way?It's one of the reasons she <i>did</i> run off.
Fran: Do you think they'll get back together?
A: I sure hope so. Otherwise he's <i>our</i> responsibility, and I don't think I can take him for too much longer..
Aawoowwah!
Fran: Wh-what's that noise?
A: Oh, nothing?Just Vladek?He's moaning in his sleep again. When I was a kid I though that was the noise <i>all</i> grown-ups made while they slept.
Fran: Sigh. It's so peaceful here at night, it's almost impossible to believe Auschwitz ever happened.
A: Uh-huh. Ouch! (Slap) But these damn bugs are eating me alive! (Psht)
Fran: Me too.
A: C'mon. Let's go inside and read?It's getting kinda chilly out anyway.
