			case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<p><b>Norman Mailer</b> (1923-2007) was an American novelist, journalist, essayist, playwright, film maker, actor and political candidate.[1] Born in Long Branch, New Jersey in 1923, he entered Harvard in the fall of 1939 and graduated in 1943 with his S.B. degree and honors in engineering. In early 1944, he was drafted and served as a rifleman in the 112th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippines Campaign in World War II in the South Pacific, based on experiences of which he wrote the huge best-seller <i>The Naked And The Dead</i> (1948).[2] The 112th was based in San Antonio until it was converted to an infantry force. Many of the men in the unit had underwent more than two years’ of heavy combat in the Pacific by the time Mailer and other transfers joined them in the Philippines.[3]</p><p>The book, Mailer states in retrospect, was the work of an amateur author who began writing it “at the age of twenty-three and completed it fifteen months later had already written more than a quarter of a million words in college.”[4] In 1947, after delivering the manuscript of the war novel, Mailer traveled to Europe with his first wife, Beatrice, on the GI Bill. Visiting Europe was a “miraculous opportunity” not only because there was Paris, a city of aspiring authors, but also because he always admired the “expatriate pasts of the Lost Generation writers” he revered: Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, and Henry Miller. While Mailer and Beatrice were away in Europe, the novel <i>Naked</i> was received exceptionally well, and was published on May, 1948. Staying on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list for eleven consecutive weeks, it remained on the list for total 62 weeks. Upon returning to America, expecting yet unprepared to be treated as a “celebrity,” Mailer’s literary career flourished.[5] Some of his other works include <i>The Executioner’s Song</i> and <i>Armies of the Night</i>, which received two Pulitzer’s Prizes and a National Book Award, respectively.[6]</p><sup>1</sup>”Norman Mailer,” <i>Wikipedia</i>, May 1 2014, <a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Mailer”> (accessed May 13 2014)<sup>2</sup>J.

FROM <i>The Naked and the Dead</i>
CHAPTER 7
<p>
After the night when the Japanese failed to cross the river, the first squad remained in its position for three days. On the fourth day, 1stBattalion advanced a half mile and recon moved up with A Company. Their new outpost was on the crest of a hill which looked down into a tiny valley of kunai grass; they spent the rest of the week digging new holes, stringing barbed wire, and making routine patrols. The front had become quiet. Nothing happened to the platoon, and they seldom saw any other men except for the platoon of A Company whose positions were on an adjoining hill a few hundred yards away. The bluffs of Watamai Range were still on their right, quite close, and in the late afternoon the cliffs hung over them like a wave of surf about to break.
</p>

<p>
The men in recon spent their days sitting in the sun on top of the hill. There was nothing to do except eat their rations and sleep and write letters and stand guard in their foxholes. The mornings were pleasant and new, but by afternoon the men were sullen and drowsy, and at night they found it hard to sleep, for the wind moved the grass in the valley beneath them and it looked like a column of men moving toward their hill. At least once or twice every night, a man on guard would awaken the entire squad and they would sit in their holes for almost an hour searching the field beneath them in the silver uncertain moonlight. Occasionally, they would hear the crackling of some rifles in the distance sounding like a bonfire of dry twigs on an autumn day, and often a shell or two would arch lazily overhead, sighing and murmuring before it crashed into the jungle beyond their lines. At night the machineguns would be hollow and deep, and would hold the mournful boding note of primitive drums. Almost always, they could hear some noise like a grenade or a mortar or the insistent shrill tatting of a sub-machine gun, but the sounds were so far away and so muffled that in time they dis regarded them. The week went by in an uncomfortable suspended tension which they felt only in their unvoiced fear of the towering mute walls of Watamai Range on their right.
</p>

<p>
Every day a ration detail of three men would trudge over to the hill on which the adjacent platoon of A Company was bivouacked, and return with a box of 10-in-1 rations and two five-gallon jerricans of water. •The trip was always uneventful and the men did not dislike it, for the monotony of the morning was broken and it gave them a chance to talk to someone other than the men in their squad .On the last day of the week, Croft and Red and Gallagher filed down their hill, wove through the six-foot kunai grass in the valley beneath them, emerged into a bamboo grove, and from there followed the trail that Jed to A Company. They filled their empty water cans, strapped them to pack boards, and talked for a few minutes with some of the men in A Company before starting back. Croft was leading them, and when he reached the beginning of the trail he halted, and motioned to Red and Gallagher to come forward.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," he whispered. "You men were making too goddam much noise coming down the hill. Just 'cause this is a short distance and you got a little weight on your back don' mean you're supposed to wallow round like a bunch of goddam pigs."
"Okay," Gallagher muttered sullenly.
"C'mon, let's go," Red muttered. He and Croft had hardly spoken to each other all week.
</p>

<p>
The three men filed slowly down the trail keeping a distance of ten yards between them. Red found himself treading warily, and he realized with a trace of anger that Croft's command was influencing him. He walked along for many yards trying to determine whether he was afraid of Croft's anger or his caution came from habit. He was still debating this when he saw Croft stop abruptly, and creep through some bushes on the side of the trail. Croft turned around and looked at Gallagher and him, and then waved his arm forward in a slow silent motion. Red looked at his face; Croft's mouth and eyes were expressionless but there was a poise and tension about his entire body which was imperative. Red crouched and moved up beside him. When the three of them were together, Croft held his finger to his mouth, and then pointed through a break in the foliage beside the trail. About twenty-five yards away there was a tiny hollow. It was actually no more than a small clearing, encircled by jungle, but in the middle of it three Japanese soldiers were sprawled on the ground, resting with their heads on their packs, and a fourth soldier was sitting beside them with his rifle across his lap, his chin resting on his hand. Croft looked at them for a long tense second, and then stared fiercely at Red and Gallagher. His jaw had tightened, and a small lump of cartilage beneath his ear quivered once or twice. Very carefully, he slipped off his pack board and laid it noiselessly on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"We can't get through that brush without making a noise, he whispered almost soundlessly." Ah'm gonna throw a grenade, and then we all rush together. Y'undcrstand?"
</p>

<p>
They nodded dumbly, stripping their packs. Then Red peered through the yards of brush that separated them from the draw. If the grenade failed to kill the Japs, all three of them would be exposed as they went charging through the brush. Actually he hardly thought of this; he rebelled against everything in the situation. It was unbelievable. He always had a similar reaction when he knew he would be in combat in a few seconds. It always seemed impossible he would move or tire his gun, exposé his life, and yet he always advanced. Red was feeling now the anger that always followed this, a rage at his desire to avoid the moment to come. I'm as good as any man jack, he told himself numbly. He looked at Gallagher, whose face was white, and Red felt a surprising contempt although he knew that he was himself equally frightened. Croft's nostrils had dilated, and the pupils of his eyes looked cold and very black; Red hated him because Croft could enjoy this.
</p>

<p>
Croft slipped a grenade out of his belt, and pulled the safety pin. Red looked through the foliage again and ~tared at the backs of the Japanese soldiers. He could see the face of the man who was sitting up, and it added to the unreality; he felt as though something were choking him. The Japanese soldier had a pleasant bland face with wide temples and a heavy jaw; he looked cow-like and his thick hands appeared sturdy and callused. Red had for a moment an odd detached pleasure, quite incongruous, which stemmed from the knowledge that he was unobserved. And yet all of this was mixed with dread, and the certainty that none of it was real. He could not believe that in a few seconds the soldier with the broad pleasant face was going to die.
</p>

<p>
Croft opened his fingers, and the handle of the grenade snapped off and spun a few feet away. The fuse in the grenade popped, and a sputtering noise destroyed the silence. The Japanese heard it, sprang to their feet with sudden cries, and moved a few steps uncertainly back and forth in the tiny circle of the draw. Red watched the expression of terror on one soldier's face, heard the sizzling of the grenade, the sound mixing with the ringing in his ears and the pounding of his heart, and then dropped to the ground as Croft lofted the grenade into the draw. Red grasped his tommy gun and stared intently at a blade of grass. He had time before the grenade exploded to wish he had cleaned his gun that morning. He heard a terrifying shriek, thought once of the soldier with the broad face, and then found himself afoot, crashing and stumbling through the brush.
</p>

<p>
The three of them halted on the edge of the draw and looked down. All four of the Japanese soldiers were lying motionless in the trampled kunai grass. Croft gazed at them and spat softly. "Co down and take a look," he told Red.
</p>

<p>
Red slid down the bank to the gully where the bodies lay sprawled. He could tell at a glance that two of the men were certainly dead; one of them reposed on his back with his hands clawed over the bloody mash of what had once been his face, and the other was crumpled on his side with a great rent in his chest. The other two men had fallen on their stomachs and he could see no wounds.
"Finish them off," Croft shouted down to him.
"They're dead."
"Finish them off."
Red felt a pulse of anger. If it'd been anyone else but me; the bastard would have done it himself, he thought. He stood over one of the motionless bodies, and brought the sights of his tommy gun to bear on the back of the soldier's head. He took a little breath, and then fired a burst. He felt nothing except the rising quivering motion of the gun in his hands. After he had fired, he noti6ed that it was the soldier who had been sitting with his rifle across' his thighs. There was an instant in which he hovered on the lip of an intense anxiety, but he repressed it and strode over to the last soldier.
</p>

<p>
As he looked down upon him, Red felt a wash of many transient subtle emotions. If he had been asked, he might have said, "I didn't feel a goddam thing," but the back of his neck was numb, and his heart was beating rapidly. He had an intense distaste for what he was about to do, and yet as he stared at the body and pointed his sights at the man's neck, he was feeling a pleasurable anticipation. He tightened his finger on the trigger, taking up the slack, tensing himself for the moment when he would fire and the slugs would make round little holes in a cluster, and the corpse would twitch and shake under the force of the bullets. He pictured all those sensations, pulled the trigger . . . and nothing happened. His gun had jammed. He started to work the bolt when the body underneath him suddenly rolled over. It took Red almost a second to realize that the Jap was alive. The two men stared at each other with blank twitching faces, and then the Jap sprang to his feet. There was a fraction of a second in which Red could have knocked him down with the stock of his gun, but the frustration he had felt when the gun jammed, added to the shock he experienced when he realized the soldier was alive, combined to paralyze him completely. He watched the soldier stand up, move a step toward him, and then Red's muscles worked suddenly, and he hurled his gun at the Jap. It mis~cd, and the two soldiers continued to stare at each other, not three yards apart.
</p>

<p>
Red could never forget the Jap's face. It was gaunt and the skin was drawn tightly over the eyes and cheeks and nostrils so that he had a hungry searching look. He had never seen a man's face so intensely; his gaze concentrated until he could detect every imperfection in the man’s skin. He saw blackheads on the Jap's forehead, and a tiny pustule on the side of his nose, C¥1d drops of sweat in the deep hollows under his eyes. Perhaps they stared at each other for half a second, and then the Japunsheathed his bayonet, and Red turned and ran. He saw the other man lunging toward him, and Red thought inanely, Horror movie. With a great effort he shrieked over his shoulder, "Get him, GET HIM,CROFT!"
</p>

<p>
Then Red tripped, and lay motionless on the ground, half stunned. He was trying to ready himself for the flash of pain the knife would cause as it pierced his back, and he held his breath. He heard his heart beat once, and then once more. His alertness was returning, and he poised his body. His l•eart beat again, and again, and again. Abruptly, he realized that nothing was going to happen. Croft’s clear cold voice grated in his ear. "Goddam, Red, how long you gonna lay on the ground?"
</p>

<p>
Red rolled over and sat up. He repressed a groan with difficulty, but the effort made him shudder. "Jesus," he said. “What do you think of your boyfriend?" Croft asked softly.
The Jap was standing several yards away with his hands in the air. He had dropped the bayonet, and it lay at his feet. Croft walked over and kicked it away.
Red looked at the Japanese soldier, and for an instant their eyes met. Both men looked away, as if they had each been caught in something shameful. Red realized suddenly how weak he felt.
Yet even now he could not admit any weakness to Croft. "What took you guys so goddam long?" he asked.
"Cot down as fast as we could," Croft said. Gallagher spoke up abruptly. His face was white and his mouth trembled. "I was gonna ~hoot the mother-fugger but you were in the
Way."
</p>

<p>
Croft laughed quietly, and then said, "Ah' guess we frightened him more than you, Red. He damn sure stopped running after you when he saw us. "
</p>

<p>
Red found himself shuddering again. He felt a grudged admiration for Croft, and with it a great deal of resentment at being in his debt. For a second or two he tried to find some way to thank him, but he could not utter the words.
"I guess we might as well head back," Red said.
Croft's expression seemed to change. A glint of excitement formed in his eyes. "Why don't you head on back, Red?" he suggested. "Gallagher and me'll follow you in a couple of minutes."
Red forced himself to say, "Want me to take the Jap?" There was nothing he wanted less. He found himself still unable to look at the soldier. “No," Croft said. "Gallagher and me'll take care of him."
Red realized there was something odd about Croft at this moment." I can take him okay, •• he said.
"No, we'll take care of him."
</p>

<p>
Red looked once at the bodies lying limp in the green draw. Already a few insects were buzzing over the corpse who had lost his face. Everything that had happened to him seemed unreal again. He looked at the soldier from whom he had fled, and already his face seemed anonymous and small. A part of him wondered why he had not been able to meet his eyes. Jesus, I feel pooped, he thought. His legs quivered a little as he picked up his tommy gun. He felt too tired to say anything more. "Okay, see you up on the hill," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
For some obscure reason, he knew he should not leave, and as he walked away down the trail he felt again the curious shame and guilt the Japanese soldier had caused him. That Croft's a bastard, he told himself. Red felt leaden, in fever.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone, Croft sat down on the ground and lit a cigarette. He smoked intently without saying anything. Gallagher sat beside him, looking at the prisoner. "Let's get rid of him and get back," he blurted suddenly.
"Hold your water,'' Croft told him softly.
"What's the use of torturin' the poor bastard?" Gallagher asked.
"He ain't complainin'," Croft said.
</p>

<p>
But then, as if he had understood them, the prisoner crumpled suddenly to his knees and began to sob in a high-pitched voice. Every few seconds he would turn to them, and extend his hands with pleading motions, and then he would beat his arms on the ground as if he despaired of making them understand. Out of the spate of words, Gallagher could distinguish something that sounded like "kood-sigh, kood-sigh. “Gallagher was a little hysterical from the abruptness with which the combat had begun and ended. His momentary compassion for the prisoner lapsed and was replaced by an intense irritation. "Let's cut out that 'kood-sigh' shit," he roared at the Jap. 
</p>

<p>
The soldier was silent for a moment, and then began to plead again. His voice had a desperate urgency which rasped Gallagher's senses. "You look like a fuggin Yid with all that hand waving," he shouted.
"Let's keep it down," Croft said.
The soldier approached them, and Gallagher looked uncomfortably into his black pleading eyes. A powerful fishy stench arose from his clothing. "They sure can stink," Gallagher said.
</p>

<p>
Croft kept staring at the Jap. An emotion was obviously working through his mind, for the lump of cartilage under his ear kept pulsing. Croft actually was not thinking at all; he was bothered by an intense sense of incompletion. He was still expecting the burst that Red's gun had never fired. Even more than Red, he had been anticipating the quick lurching spasms of the body when the bullets would crash into it, and now he felt an intense dissatisfaction.
</p>

<p>
He looked at his cigarette, and on an impulse he handed it to the Japanese soldier. "What're you doing that for?'' Gallagher asked.
"Let him smoke."
The prisoner puffed at it eagerly, and yet self-consciously. His eyes kept darting suspiciously at Croft and Gallagher, and the sweat glistened on his cheeks.
"Hey; you," Croft said, "sit down.”
The Jap looked at him with uncomprehending eyes. "Sit down." Croft made some motions with his hands, and the prisoner squatted with his back against a tree. "You got anything to eat?" Croft asked Gallagher.
"I got a chocolate bar from the ration."
"Let's have it," Croft said. He took the bar from Gallagher and handed it to the soldier, who looked at him with dull eyes. Croft made eating motions with his hands, and the prisoner, comprehending, ripped the paper away, and wolfed down the chocolate. "Goddam, he sure is hungry," Croft said.
"What the fug are you doin' it for?" Gallagher asked. He felt exasperated to the point of tears. He had been saving the candy for over a day, and its loss pained him; moreover, he was vacillating between irritability at the prisoner and a grudged compassion. "The dumb bastard sure is skinny," he said with the superior affection he might have used if he saw a mongrel dog shivering in the rain. But then immediately afterward he watched the last piece of chocolate disappear in the Jap's mouth, and he muttered angrily, "What a goddam pig he is.”
</p>

<p>
Croft thought of the night the Japanese had tried to cross the river. He felt a shiver work its way through him, and he stared for a long time at the prisoner. He felt an intense emotion toward him which made him clench his teeth. But what it was, he could not have said. He removed his canteen and took a drink. He saw the prisoner watching him as he gulped down the water, and on an impulse he handed him the canteen. “Go ahead, drink," he said. Croft gazed at him as he swallowed with long eager draughts.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a sonofabitch," Gallagher said. "What got in ya?"
</p>

<p>
Croft did not answer. He was staring at the prisoner, who had finished drinking. There were a few tears of joy in the Jap's face and he smiled suddenly and pointed to his breast pocket. Croft extracted a wallet, and opened it. There was a picture of the Japanese soldier in civilian dress and beside him was his wife and two children with round doll faces. The Japanese soldier pointed to himself and then made two gestures with his hands above the ground to indicate how tall his children had grown. Gallagher looked at the picture, and felt a pang. For an instant he remembered his wife and wondered what his child would look like when it was born. With a shock he realized that his wife might be in labor now. For some reason which he did not understand he said suddenly to the Jap, ''I'm gonna have a kid in a couple of days. II
</p>

<p>
The prisoner smiled politely, and Gallagher pointed angrily to himself and then held his hands extended and about nine inches apart. "Me," he said, "me."
"Abhhhhh," the prisoner said. "Chiisai!"
"Yeah, chccl':-igh," Gallagher said.
The prisoner shook his head slowly, and smiled again.
Croft came up to him, and gave him another cigarette. The Japanese soldier bowed low, and accepted the match. "Arigato, arigato, domoarigato, .. he said.
</p>

<p>
Croft felt his head pulsing with an intense excitement. There were tears in the prisoner's eyes again, and Croft looked at them dispassionately. He gazed once about the little draw, and watched a fly crawl over the mouth of one of the corpses.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner had taken a deep puff and was leaning back now against the trunk of the tree. His eyes had closed, and for the first time there was a dreamy expression on his face. Croft felt a tension work itself into his throat and leave his mouth dry and bitter and demanding. His mind had been entirely empty until now, but abruptly he brought up his rifle and pointed it at the prisoner's head. Gallagher started to protest as the Jap opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner did not have time to change his expression lxlfore the shot crashed into his skull. He slumped forward, and then rolled on his side. He was still smiling but he looked silly now.
