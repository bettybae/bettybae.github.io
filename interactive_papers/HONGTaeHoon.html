Forman was born June 15, 1904 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<sup>1</sup> He graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in Oriental Philosophy. As a journalist, photographer, and explorer, he had been known as “a modern Marco Polo” during his lifetime.<sup>2</sup> During the early 1930’s, while staying in China, he heard of a mountain in Tibet supposedly taller than Mt. Everest and went to Tibet seeking to discover it. Even though he never found it, he earned the distinction of being one of the first western visitors to visit Tibet. His experience in Tibet led him to become the technical director for Lost Horizon, an Academy Award-winning film. During the late thirties, Forman became best known for his coverage of issues in Far East Asia. As a cameraman for the newsreel service, March of Time, he covered the Sino-Japanese conflict, and as a reporter of the New York Times, he covered Japanese forces across Asia. In addition, his coverage of the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 during World War II played a part in his building a reputation. Later he wrote books on China and Africa and ran a travel agency. He worked for many newspaper and magazine companies such as London Times, New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Harper’s Life, Reader’s Digest, and National Geographic. He was also a lifetime member of the Explorer’s Club. Mr. Forman died on January 31, 1978 in New York City.<sup>3</sup></p><p>References<sup>1</sup> “Harrison Forman,”<a href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=forman-harrison-1904-1978-cr.xml">http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=forman-harrison-1904-1978-cr.xml</a> (accessed May 13, 2014)<sup>2</sup> “Travel Diaries and Scrapbooks of Harrison Forman 1932 – 1973,” <i>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries</i>,  <a href="http://collections.lib.uwm.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/forman/" > http://collections.lib.uwm.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/forman/ </a>(accessed May 13, 2014)<sup>3</sup> “Harrison Forman,”<a href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=forman-harrison-1904-1978-cr.xml">http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=forman-harrison-1904-1978-cr.xml</a> (accessed May 13, 2014)</p>'); break;

POLISH
Felt like trapped rat. Market day massacres. Russ[ia] want[s] Bessarabia, Hun[gar]y want[s] Transylv[ania]. Cav[alry] vs. mechan[ization]. French mad. Took no advice. Proud. Waited weeks before ask help, then too late. Would not even tell where front line was, much less show it. How could planes come to help if unknowing where to land. Also, no stores of ammunition for
</p>

<p>
Fr[ench] plane guns and bomb-racks. Poles so reliant on cavalry, that they asked for no help for fear glory of German defeat might be stolen by Fr[ench] or Brit[ish]. Cavalry might have been valuable, if rain had come. Army surrounded most of Warsaw. Another ½ west of Lwów. Poles didn’t even have time to mob[ilize].
</p>
	
<p> 
Day after first call many returned, for had no uniforms or arms. Pol[ish] Army had no field wireless or even telephones. Consequently when spies cut few commercial telephone lines, High Command lost complete contact with armies. One general didn’t know where other was, and often where his own was.
</p>	

<p> 
Smigly-Ridz not a trained general, but a hero of Bolshevik War - - guerrilla fighting, etc. But so conceited that would take no advice from French. Consequently, strung his army along 1000 km of Germ[an] border. Germ[an] concentrated attacks at several points and broke thru. Poles
</p>
	
<p> 
should have retired to Vistula: (1) To shorten and straighten line to 500 km (2) To dig in for a strong stand. But Poles refused to give up any territory under any circumstances. Result, were outflanked and surrounded, with no strong second line to fall back on even if could retreat in

<p>
time. Romania and other small countries refuse to profit by Poland’s fall. Still insist on complete neutrality – separately – refusing proferred Br[itish] + Fr[ench] help, for fear antagonizing Germ[an]. But will, like Poland, yell for help when too late, as

<p> 
Toute s’arrange a Romanie It. Feel that were forced to turn to G[erman] because of Brit[ish] opposition to Ethiop[ia]. Know that Germ[an], whom they hate, would xx them if join Hitler. Have good sense of humor. Laugh aloud at dwarfish Jap[anese] diplomats in Newark being received by 
It[alian] officials. Significant that It[alian] controlled press speaks of “Russ[ian] intervention” in Poland.
</p>
	
<p> 
It[alian] definitely scared by Russ[ian] angle in War. Revolution here before church would allow joining Unholy Alliance. Blame everything on Eden’s policy in Eth[iopia] which forced It[alian] into arms of Hitler. 300,000 Fascist Militia received 8 lira/day, compared with ½ lira/day received by regular troops. Agitation resulted in reducing Fas[cist] Mil[itia] pay to 1 lira/day and raising reg./troops to same.
</p>
	
<p> 
Italians first knew of Germ[an]-Russ[ian] Pact only 8 hours before signing. Mad, because means end of Anti-Comintern Pact. Also double-cross. Were It[alian] to join Germ[an] they would get worst win or lose. They are vulnerable to attack by air and sea. Even Franco annoyed at Hitler double-cross.
Hitler told by Muss. thru Ciano that It[alian] would support him in another blackmailing Munich.
</p>
	
<p>
But if Hitler insisted on Poland attack, It[alian] would not come in. Hit[ler] then made deal with Russ[ian] – who now also worried at possible xx with Germ[an] on their border. Are forced to mobilize and worry about Hitler’s wanting of Ukraine. It[alian] Press, which is one of most controlled in Europe, is completely objective

<p> 
in reporting war. Absolutely no opinionating, which is amazing. No chest-pounding. No mention of Axis. Are worried about Germ[an] pressure to supply materials, knowing Fr[ench] + Eng[lish] watching closely, and if F[rench] + E[nglish] suspect this will demand Italy come in for or against, or at least - - be blockaded. So hopes
</p>

<p>
of Italy to profit by war thus blighted. Formerly many Germ[an] “technicians” here. Now none. Man in street glad. Hate Germans. Italy wants no war. Least jittery of all neutrals. If forced to make choice, more chance to join Allies than Hitler - - who’ll make Colony of Italy. No single word from M. in 2 weeks. Hope for ruin, servants closing windows. Sweltering
</p>
	
<p>
Windows should be open during raid, or broken by concussion. But believe will keep out gas. Fear in eyes. Hushed voices. Blued flashlights. But bright moon floods city so easily spotted from air. V8 profiteering under penalty of concentration camp. Everyone digs trenches. Men, women + children. Number of hours recorded in a pass-card given
</p>
	
<p> 
Hotel porter who said: "Best passport in the world!" Quiet clop-clop of horse + buggies in black out. An anachronism. Cabarets open, but no gaiety. In critical days no longer checked gas masks with hats + coats when entering restaurant, etc. Even danced with masks. For knew you'd have no time no
</p>
	
<p>
strength to fight someone who'd picked up your mask at an alarm. It was a grim thought and picture of to what animalistic depths the world has descended in this Twilight of Civilization. Gas masks for babies! Tak! Tak! Tak! The rains came 2 weeks too late. Might have saved Poland by bogging
</p>
	

<p>
down Boche mechanized troops, which cavalry no matter how brave could not hope to resist. Cavalry okay in bad weather. Poles had hoped, even been confident of victory with better mobile cavalry in bad weather. But.... Courage and flesh are no match against steel and driving mobility.
</p>
	
<p>
Gov[ernment] stayed only few hours in Lublin, fleeing again when news of Germ[an] break-through to west. Headed for Russ[ian] border; but when word of Russ[ian] mobil[ity], Gov[ernment] scrammed south to tiny piece Romanian border. Planes carried many on to Bucarest. Germ[an] Prop[erty] Bureau -- best in world -- arranged for neutral newsmen to view "mutilated" German
</p>
	
<p>
civilians at hands of Polish. Then facilitated rapid release of photographs and stories. Poles had plenty to shout about, but didn't realize value of getting Press on scene. Thousands of buses in Lublin. No gas for cars, which taken by Gov[ernment]. Case of PAT fellow who picked me up and took me to Embassy. Got

<p>
wind up when saw everyone evacuating. Decided to get out himself. But by time got to Lublin, was brave Pole again. Even going to volunteer. But later looking for me again to get gas go on. In ditch man, wife + baby. Refugees from Lodz. They had nothing but car and few handbags. Yet could get gas because one of civilian de-
</p>
	
<p> 
fenders of Lwow against Russians in 28. "Brave then, and brave again now," said he. "But," with look at wife and baby, then overhead at bombers, “what can I do against them?" pointing to sky. Yes, what could whole city do against "them"? The 2nd largest city in Poland, totally defenseless against plane attack!
</p>
	


<p>
Perhaps they did have anti-aircraft guns. If so, still more disgraceful in not have ammunition. Jews will suffer most. 3½ million of them. 10% pop. -- greatest proportion of all European countries. (Germany has only 1% Jews.) And, despite Poles protest that Jews have control of industry the Jews in Poland
</p>
	
<p> 
are of the lowest class. In Ghettos, bearded and booted, filth, and clad in long-gowned traditional garb. Well they knew what was in store for them. Yet what could they do? Where could they go? Were not permitted to travel. For that matter, all refugee travel was stopped after first few days.
</p>
	
<p> 
Gov[ernment] explained this by saying had to keep roads clear. Gov[ernment] radio also claimed fantastic successes - such as capture of Konigsberg and half of E[ast] Prussia. Also reports of Fr[ench]“advancing another 80 km today beyond Rhine." Details given of “dampness” and such, in Siegfried Line which Fr[ench] supposed to have taken.
</p>
	
<p> 
Gave out rumors that Hitler was abdicating. Gov[ernment] out to Rom[ania] in scores airplanes. Germ[an] knew Poles unprepared for rapid mobilization. Thus plan was to drive thru with strong spearhead mechanized attacks without stopping to mop up or consolidate, which coupled with almost complete paralyzation of communications
</p>
	
<p>
by spies and bombings, resulted in wild panic amongst Poles with fleeing Gov[ernment], etc. so that unable to effect organized mobilization. In this were completely successful. The Big Scram of Sept. 6. BLITZKRIEG IN POLAND. British corresp[ondent] who refused to believe in collapse
</p>
	



<p> 
Poland, despite evidences. Insisted only “tactical retreat" according to plan." When P[olish] Gov[ernment] asked why no fortifications replied proudly “we don't need them. This will be a mobile war. Our valiant cavalry(40 regiments) will not only cut down any attack, but we will actually invade Germany. G[erman] sent 5,000 tanks
</p>
	
<p>
with flame throwers, which mowed down cavalry, who were finished off by planes which also – after destroying P[olish] air force - decimated P[olish] infantry. Relied upon “mobile war” but prepared for no retreat or defenses if thrown back. Little protection for civilians in 3-story Warsaw. Day of Big Scram knapsacks were hurriedly purchased and such, in Siegfried Line which Fr[ench] supposed to have taken.
</p>
	
<p>
and packed with suitcase even though had a car. For who knew when more gas might be obtained, or car commandeered, and one had to walk with only what he could carry. And there’d be no hitchhiking, either. Cars were stopped, and if carried a pet dog of such, were mobbed by frenzied refugees
</p>
	
<p>
for example Germ[an] demand gas stores, supplies, etc. Will become occupied states in effect if not actuality. See plight of Bulgaria in World War when Germ[an] took everything for Germ[an] from 
Bulgaria – their ally. Poland tried sit on two chairs. Had pact with France against Germ[any] + with Germ[any] against Russ[ia]
</p> 

<p> 
So hesitated accept help from France when Germ[an] began putting on pressure. Result: Germ[an] + Russ[ian] got together for partition on Pol[ish]. Poles reason not accepting French help. “We don’t want be colony France!”
