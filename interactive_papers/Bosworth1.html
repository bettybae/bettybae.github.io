	Nations Examine Their Past: A Comparative Analysis of the Historiography of the "Long" Second World War</p>
<p>R.J.B. Bosworth
University of Western Australia
</p>
<p>IN RECENT YEARS we have lived through a slew of commemorations of the end of the Second World War. 
As early as April, 1994, an editorial writer on <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100"><i>The Economist</i></a> wondered about the meaning of this 
commemorating.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> The anniversaries of the end of the 
Second World War, the author of the editorial 
suggested, signaled the chance to review what had been said, and, thus, what had been left unsaid 
about that conflict in its widest ethical definition, and, thus, about what I have called, in my 
own recent book, the "long" Second World War. What I implied in my usage of that term was that the
 military events of the war, with their own inextricable civilian connections, were also welded to
 their immediate pasts. Thus, Italy's "long" Second World War began with the Fascist accession to 
 power in 1922, Germany's in 1933, Japan's in 1931, the USSR's in 1929, or perhaps in 1917, 
 Britain's and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">France's</a> in the Depression or in the commencement of appeasement policies.2 
 Seeming to understand this concept of a war larger than the events from 1939 to 1945, The 
 Economist's journalist argued: "For nations as for people, denial of the past can be 
 corrupting... 'Never again' and 'know thyself remain handy maxims for just about every 
 country under the sun."3 In this regard, the article concluded, Germany had become probably 
 the most "honest" society in its "collective self-analysis." Other ex-combatant states— the 
 journalist mentioned Russia, France, Italy and Japan, but, strangely, not Great Britain'—had 
 not yet done as well in grappling with this aspect of their past.
</p>
<p>
As I scanned the editorial (and wondered self-indulgently whether someone had read my book), 
it seemed to me that the journalist, in writing an assessment of the present historiography 
of the Second World War, nonetheless had not yet fully reckoned with the history of this 
historiography. In the paper which follows I shall endeavor to overcome that absence by 
briefly examining the turning-points in post-1945 explanations of the "long" Second World 
War. For, I shall argue, the historicization process has been underpinned by its own 
structures. Individual historians, the historiographies of particular nations, naturally 
have nourished their own idiosyncrasies. Every person or unit possesses some free will. 
And yet the history of fifty years of history writing, of historical "representation" and
 "explanation" about so terrible, so wrenching, so "ultimate" an event as the war, does 
 reveal many commonalities, and shows, predictably, that, as E.H. Carr remarked after his
 own, highly equivocal, experience of the "long" Second World War, "the fact is that all 
 human actions are both free and determined, according to the point of view from which one
 considers them."5
</p>
<p>After 1945, cities and lives were reconstructed out of the devastation of bombing, 
after the passage of armies and after having endured the horror of German occupation. 
As Bruno Bettelheim and many others6 would remark, so, too, were ideas to be re-made 
after the war and with the holocaust and "Auschwitz" at least partially in mind. The 
war's assault had injured time itself—not for nothing would people believe that the 
worst abyss of the Second World War should be dated at Anno Zero, Year Nought, a moment
 in which national continuities, and therefore "history," had been shattered as surely 
 as had the buildings of Warsaw and Hamburg and Leningrad and Tokyo and the rest. All 
 survivors of the conflict were to some extent left with the task of either abandoning 
 their history or re-working it.7 All had to re-establish a national calendar and 
 re-locate a usable past. All had to find a strategy to repair the trauma of war, to 
 permit time to flow again and thus to resume the more ordinary chronology of national
 history.
</p>
<p>The historical reconstruction which occurred under the brightest glare of attention
 was that of "Germany," or, rather, of West Germany, since the DDR (the German 
 Democratic Republic), at least by the 1980s, was following a historiographical track
 bearing some similarity to that taken by the Soviet bloc which shall be reviewed 
 below.s Frank Fiiredi, in his self-consciously radical analysis of the place of history
 in our society, has concluded that, "after the end of the Second World War, it was not
 possible to think of a return to a normal past." He has spoken of an "intellectual 
 crisis of the Western world," a crisis which would survive until the 1960s: "If there
 is a single experience which dealt a severe blow to nationalist history, belief in 
 absolute values and identification with society, it is the Second World War."9 But in
 so arguing, Fiiredi underestimates the shamelessness and durability of conservative 
 versions of history. At least in so far as West Germany is concerned, what is striking
 about the 1950s is precisely the German history profession's initial ability to write
 off the whole Nazi experience and to re-compose a familiar nationalist account of the
 past. This comfortable re-working was accomplished by the simple expedient of blaming
 Nazism either on Hitler—the Wicked Great Man whom a malevolent Destiny could have 
 wished on any society, the "accident in the works"—or on the general corruption and
 sinfulness of the "West" since the French Revolution, a milieu in which the feeble 
 Weimar Republic had been only one bit-player among many. Sociologically speaking, 
 the German historical profession had emerged relatively unscathed from the highly 
 uneven "Nazi Revolution." For historians like Hans Rothfels or Gerhard Ritter, "Business
 as Usual" was the first slogan for the post-Auschwitz world.
</p>
<p>This slogan would be amended (in some part) only in the 1960s. The symbol of change,
 and the object of major controversy over his two great books—Griff nach der Weltmacht
 (1961) and Krieg der Illusionen (1969)— which conveniently marked out the beginning 
 and end of the decade, was Fritz Fischer. Bolstered by some new-generation historians,
 who would assemble in the so-called Bielefeld school, and by the work of the liberal 
 sociologist, Ralf Dahrendorf, Fischer gave intellectual legitimacy to the idea of the
 "negative Sonderweg" (negative separate path). According to this interpretation, Hitler
 and his regime were not mere aberrations. Rather a continuity ran through German history
 from the flawed unification of 1870 to 1914 to 1933 to 1945 and, perhaps, beyond. In 
 that "German era," the German nation bore the greatest responsibility for two world wars
 in all their horror, and did so not just because of geo-politics and strategic machination,
 but also because of the German elites' refusal seriously to countenance democracy. 
 German decision-making, certainly in the Imperial era and perhaps in the Nazi one, 
 reflected the "primacy of internal politics."
</p>
<p>Moreover, the Fischerites alleged, for the sins of this Sonderweg, historians themselves
 must take some blame. Secure in the prestige of being the children of Leopold von Ranke 
 and confident that their understanding of his "scientific" historicism meant that they 
 wrote the truth, the German professors had traditionally served their nation to the cost
 of humankind. But these same professors, as they gravely occupied their much-reverenced
 and well-rewarded chairs, now, it seemed, needed to engage in some self-criticism. 
 There were plenty of messages, too, for West German politics at large. To make sure the
 "negative special path" had been abandoned, West Germans must accept that the Social 
 Democratic Party (SPD) should at last be legitimized, as it had so signally failed to
 be before 1914 or during Weimar. Willy Brandt' s Ostpolitik was plainly the proper line
 for West German diplomacy; only an Ostpolitik could officially end the Second World War
 and repudiate the traditions of the Drang nach Osten. No wonder controversy raged around
 Fischer' s books. As Dahrendorf would explain: "Its bitterness and intensity are 
 understandable only if we remember that Fischer has pulled the center piece out of
 the whole, useful conception of history the profession has built up"1° and, he might
 have added, out of the basic conservative comprehension of the German past, present 
 and future.
</p>
<p>From the fire of these controversies came spiritual and practical growth. When, in 
the 1970s, the Social Democratic Party entrenched itself in government and the Bielefeld
 school seemed to gain hegemony in the writing of contemporary history, West Germany 
 appeared to have learned the "lessons" of the Second World War and, indeed, to be 
 democratizing its politics and society even as it democratized its history. Nor, 
 despite some very public alarms, has the situation been drastically reversed since
 then. In time, the Bielefeld concentration on high politics, or at least on the 
 relationship between politics and society, the school's still largely Rankean 
 methodology and its cautious preference for the social models of Max Weber rather 
 than those of Karl Marx, brought criticism from the Left. In the Anglo-Saxon world, 
 Geoff Eley wrote of his determination "to help establish the legitimacy of Marxist 
 analysis in the plural discourse of German historians,"" and urged that the sin of 
 Imperial Germany lay not so much in the persistence of its ancien regime as in its 
 modernity. The German Sonderweg, in his eyes, was not so "peculiar" after all. In 
 his fertile writings Eley thus in a sense spoke for those inside and outside Germany 
 who believed that the Social Democratic Party had paid for its political legitimation 
 by surrendering its radical soul and who asserted that new times demanded a new 
 critique." Nor were Marxists and Marxisants the only doubters. By the end of the 1980s 
 Martin Broszat, in preaching the cause of Alltagsgeschichte and of what some have 
 called the "barefoot historians" of everyday life, warned that "the Nazi era has lost 
 much of its singularity in light of new catastrophes and atrocities, and we are left 
 with a set of convictions, as safe as they are vague, that no longer carry any moral 
 force."" From the perspective of every day, perhaps, the "long" Second World War was 
 no longer the only or the chief ethical touchstone for the politics of the 1990s.
</p>
<p>While the Left sought out new issues, on the Right there was plenty of evidence that 
minds had not been radically purged by the "contestations" of the 1960s. The theory of 
totalitarianism remained the dominant paradigm in West German school history and 
communism remained a literally unspeakable ideology. Nor had other conservative ideas 
been abandoned. In the Historikerstreit of the mid-1980s, figures such as Ernst Nolte, 
Michael Stiirmer and Andreas Hillgruber enunciated anew beliefs for which Fischer and 
his followers had criticized the Imperial or interwar intelligentsia. They argued that 
the Bolsheviks had a primacy in evil which the Nazis only imitated, that Germany's 
geo-political position, "living in the center of Europe,"14 carried certain inevitable 
strategic demands and requirements, and that the nation deserved to be proud of its 
history and its happy future was inseparable from a happily understood past.
</p>
<p>The nationalists may not have won so sweeping a victory in the Historikerstreit as 
the conservative leader Helmuth Kohl, with the help of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), 
was winning in German politics, but the dispute would indicate that their views did 
have some echo in more moderate circles. In a much praised speech in 1985, liberal 
resident Richard von Weizsacker, although he re-affirmed that the genocide of the Jews 
constituted an event "unparalleled in history" and accepted a liability for the Holocaust 
on the part of all Germans, nevertheless stayed more equivocal about some other aspects 
of the Nazi story. For him the Nazi regime still marked "an aberration in German history"; 
its only proper dating ran from 1933 to 1945 and, then, "at the root of the tyranny was 
Hitler's immeasurable hatred against our Jewish compatriots." Though Weizsacker acknowledged 
the suffering of "twenty million" Soviet and other Eastern European dead and, indeed, 
of German communists, he did not give great emphasis to the Nazis' anti-Marxism. Instead, 
he argued that the fall of the Nazis represented the conclusion of a [West] "European 
civil war"; the meeting of the Soviet and American armies on the Elbe was, he said, "a 
symbol of the temporary end of a [West] European era." And, of course, he repudiated 
the most obvious, short-term, result of the Second World War—the disunification of Germany. 
"We Germans are one people and one nation," he reiterated, "We are confident that the 8th 
of May [1945] is not the last date in the common history of all Germans."' 5
</p>
<p>A decade later, a reasonable historiographical peace seems to reign in reunited Germany. 
Some re-writing of history has been occurring since 1990 but, perhaps, not in too exceptional 
a manner, even if there are signs that "reunited" history will once more be defined, not 
merely by politicians but also by some members of the profession, as a nation-building 
device.16 The new Germany doubtless has a number of cultural blind spots, especially about 
the histories of societies to its East and, most notably, about the no longer existing DDR 
(German Democratic Republic of East Germany). Here lie some evident perils. Nonetheless, it 
is important not to over-state any reviving German problem. Germany's present historiography 
is as open to free debate and, indeed, to free international debate, as is any in the world. 
It is hard not to agree with that journalist of The Economist in observing that the Germans, 
at least when compared to other ex-combatant societies, have undertaken a very considerable 
"collective self-analysis" of the "long" Second World War . In 1996, it seems reasonable to 
assert that now there is no peculiarity of German historiography and no longer a special 
German way of comprehending the past. Indeed, the history of contemporary historiography in 
Germany seems to provide a yardstick against which other historiographies might be measured. 
Have they, too, moved from a denial to a first controversial understanding to a more serene 
acceptance that a democratic debate about the meaning of the Second World War will and should 
continue?
</p>
<p>The country the historiography of which displays the most immediate parallels with that 
of Germany is Great Britain. Keith Robbins" and others have commented on this matter in detail. 
Three or four distinct stages can be detected in Britain's historicization of the Second 
World War. In the 1950s the lessons seemed clear. Once the moral weakness and "Ethelred the 
Unready-style" back-sliding of appeasement had been overcome, Britain, especially as embodied 
in the heroic and charismatic figure of Winston Churchill, had claimed the best moral part 
in the war. However, as Robbins has noted, this sense of a special history exemplified in 
the stubborn fight and the ultimate victory, ironically, gave Britain a damagingly positive 
Sonderweg to cleave to, a too "evident" and, in fact, a misleading continuity, one with the 
rapid effect of increasing British isolation and blinding Britain's leaders and Britain's 
people to post-war developments on the continent such as the Common Market, the European 
Community, and the European Union.
</p>
<p>Such clarity and simplicity were, however, from time to time attacked. The most bitter 
public controversy broke out in 1961, the same year that saw the publication of Griff nach 
der Weltmacht, and it centered on A.J.P. Taylor's The origins of the Second World War. 
Taylor's messages have remained disputed. Twenty-five years after its original publication, 
The origins remained a teasing enough book to produce learned disagreement from such experts 
in their fields as Paul Kennedy, Akira Iriye and Sally Marks.'8 Nor has Taylor's death stilled the debate over his role as a historian.° Many, in 1961 and later, read the book as an extreme example both of empiricism and of relativism. In its conception of high politics, everything, it seemed, happened by accident. As Taylor would typically remark: "I am sometimes tempted to think that... [historians] talk so much about...profound forces in order to avoid doing the detailed work. I prefer detail to generalizations; a grave fault no doubt, but at least it helps to redress the balance."2° And yet Taylor, too, had his continuity theses— about Germany in the "German century," about the connection between the Second World War and the First, about the reasonableness of reason, and about history as debate.
</p>
<p>Though there might seem to be drastic differences between Fischer's and Taylor's books—
the first archival, learned, sober, accurate, the second based on published sources, brilliant, 
erratic, and "inaccurate"— they did carry messages that had some comparability. Each attacked 
his society's first understanding of the Second World War. Each wrote, or was read, with an 
eye on the present, in which the chance for human agency, for "free will," for the possibility 
that men and women could to a degree make their own history, needed to be re-asserted against 
those who had established a single meaning for the past and, therefore, by implication, for 
the present and for the future. Each may have written as a methodological traditionalist but 
each undermined Rankean-style historicism. Though Taylor would review E.H. Carr's What is 
History?, which also first appeared in 1961, critically, and single out for attack Carr's 
idea that historians always to some extent reflect their age ("study the historian before 
you study the facts"),2' the Taylor and Fischer controversies did indicate that a democratic 
world was, or should be, a place of historical relativism, in which, as Taylor on a number 
of occasions noted, using the phrase coined by Dutch liberal historian, Pieter Geyl, the 
discipline of history was accepted as "an argument without end."
</p>
<p>The artfulness of Taylor's style, his cleverness, his fondness for aphorism and his 
anxiety to show the way to many, sometimes contradictory, answers meant that his fame did 
not always guarantee understanding. The more obvious historiographical legacy of the 
People's War" was taken up instead by the "new social historians," particularly those 
in debt to E.P. Thompson, another individual very much "made" in (a certain version of) 
the Second World War. Taylor himself retreated from being a European to being a British 
historian and, by the time he reached a somewhat prickly old age, his heirs, at least in 
stylistic brio and the ability to reach popular audiences, were such historians of the 
Thatcherite Right as Norman Stone.
</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s, Britain, too, experienced its quieter version of a 
Historikerstreit. Corral Barnett22 was only one who argued that, for Britain, entry 
into the Second World War was a mistake, while John Charmley has re-stated the case of 
those appeasers who thought the Soviet Union (or the United States?)23 was the real 
enemy. As Charmley put it somewhat archly: "To go on a crusade against evil was one 
thing; to do so with evil at your side was another."24
</p>
<p>The hard men, however, have never swept to power in the British historiography of the 
Second World War. Rather, consensus, in and out of academe, probably still lies with an 
interpretation which it is tempting to call Majorite, i.e conservative but residually 
"wet," little Englander and not very interested in the theories or practices of foreign 
historiographies, full of a nostalgia for the perceived patriotism and decency allegedly 
possessed by the British people in wartime but also oppressed by a certain resigned 
pessimism,25 and ready to wind down but not quite cast aside the Welfare State, that 
fundamental payment to the British people for the people's side of the war. Britain, 
in 1996, is a place for which the history of the Second World War matters both too 
little and too much. Britain's collective self-analysis of that history is still 
riven by many gaps.
</p>
<p>What then of Italy, another country in whose historiography battles have raged over 
the meaning of the nation's "long" Second World War. Listen for a moment to the words 
f Silvio Berlusconi, businessperson, media magnate, football club owner, inventor, for 
a brief moment, of the newest of new politics, and fleeting Prime Minister, on 25 April 
1994. He was speaking in the immediate aftermath of an apparent electoral victory which 
had brought his Forza Italia party into power along with Gianfranco Fini' s Alleanza 
Nazionale, the allegedly "post-Fascist" successor to the neo-Fascist MSI (Italian 
Social Movement). The 49th anniversary of the end of Italy's Second World War was, 
Berlusconi urged, the moment to make peace between Fascists and Anti-Fascists; their 
past conflicts must now be viewed as only "a piece of history." From here on, 25 April 
should be celebrated by all as "the beginning of a new era."26 Italians should look to 
the future and forget the divisions of the past.
</p>
<p>How, then, did Italy reach this particular "end of history" or, rather, "end of 
historiography," the moment at which the "myth of the Resistance" to Fascism had its 
official obsequies pronounced. The story is by no means unfamiliar. If ever a country 
arrived at Anno Zero it was Italy on 8 September 1943. After a war effort which was 
feebler, more disorganized, more "corrupt" and, after the loss of its initial impetus, 
more lacking in popular support than that managed even by the Liberal regime in the 
First World War, the rulers of Italy, and especially King Victor Emmanuel III and 
Marshal Pietro Badoglio, nakedly displayed their incompetence, self-interest and 
cowardice by then abandoning their capital and their people to the Nazis in the interest 
only of saving their lives. Their flight ensured that, in the months that followed, a 
new or old Italy had to be forged from the competing forces of the clients of Anglo-American 
liberal capitalism in the South, of Fascist "true believers" in the Sala Republic in the 
North, of the diverse groups which constituted the "Resistance," and of those aiming to 
stay out of the clutches of all armed forces. As the war front raked the Italian peninsula, 
Italians themselves engaged in multiple hot or cold "civil wars" with the aim of 
re-connecting past and future.27
</p>
<p>
 In the aftermath of these events it is not at all surprising to fmd that the initial 
 Italian interpretation of the "long" Second World War preferred forgetting to analysis. 
 Benedetto Croce only put it more starkly than the rest when he urged that the whole 
 Fascist period be treated as a "parenthesis" in what he deemed the otherwise positive 
 history of an Italy of liberty and civilization. Even the Italian Communist Party (PCI) 
 opted for so-called "national populism" and, particularly through the marketing of 
 Antonio Gramsci as a sort of lay St. Francis, portrayed their own history as incarnating 
 the natural good of the Italian people. This good, they claimed, had only been prevented 
 from full development by misguided and self-interested minorities in the rivoluzione 
 mancata of the Risorgimento or in the tyranny of Fascism, a tyranny which possessed no 
 "genuine popular base." But the most typical Italian historian of the 1950s, and the 
 one most acclaimed abroad, was Federico Chabod, an anti-Marxist liberal, who clearly 
 separated the Italian people from any responsibility for the more drastic aspects of 
 Fascism. "By 1939," Chabod would argue in his lectures on contemporary history, "Fascism 
 no longer had the country behind it: the prestige of the leader and regime alike had 
 crumbled. It was ready to fall to pieces, like a machine whose spring had been broken."28
</p>
<p>Unlike West Germany and Great Britain, Italy in the 1960s did not produce a major 
historiographical controversy to reverse these rather comfortable conclusions about 
the recent past. Nevertheless, "the myth of the Resistance" did strengthen in that 
decade and was particularly invoked in the 1970s, that time of the Red Brigades, of 
the "historic compromise," and of the "crisis of the Italian crisis" between the 
rejection of the anti-divorce referendum in 1974 and the murder of Christian Democrat 
leader Aldo Moro in 1978. Perhaps the most vivid parading of a Marxistoid understanding 
of Italy's Fascist experience was provided in Bernardo Bertolucci's film 1900, whose 
release in the summer of 1976 coincided with national elections in which the Italian 
Communist Party (PCI) won more than a third of the votes.29 In its aftermath, Michael 
Ledeen, a young American historian whose politics were drifting ever more to the right, 
diagnosed a "Nero complex" in the mind of the Italian Republic. This complex, at least 
in Ledeen' s eyes, explained events like the Moro kidnapping and murder in March-May 
1978. Italy's complaint sprang from a misreading of history. Such sad events as Moro's 
killing were, Ledeen wrote, the "logical outcome of a 30 year process that has destroyed 
the cultural humus in which democracy can survive."30
</p>
<p>In reality there are major reasons to doubt that "the Left" had seized control of 
Italian culture, and, if it had, an observer must conclude, in despite of Antonio Gramsci 
(and of the constant reiteration of this claim by the contemporary Right), that cultural 
hegemony by no means always equates with political and economic power. Certainly in 
the history trade during the 1970's, conservative and liberal professors predominated 
in most Italian universities. But Ledeen's words did foreshadow that a conservative 
counter-attack on the "myth of the Resistance," and thus an Italian version of the 
Historikerstreit, would not be long in coming. Here the key figure was Renzo De Felice, 
the laborious and pertinacious31 biographer of Mussolini.32 The travail of the Italian 
Republic had coincided with the publication in 1974 of the third volume of De Felice's 
study, which covered the years from 1929 to 1936 and which had put forward the 
debatable and contested theses that the Ethiopian war was "Mussolini's masterpiece," 
that, after a decade in power, the Fascist regime could boast of having won the "consensus" 
of the overwhelming majority of Italians, and that it was, indeed, succeeding in its 
"totalitarian" ambition to forge new men and new women.
</p>
<p>In 1978 it was still unclear who had won this debate, but in the next decade and a 
half it became apparent that De Felice indeed was the victor. His successive volumes, 
with their massive "factual" base, continued to appear and De Felice became accepted, 
certainly outside Italy33 and to an increasing extent within it, as the master historian 
of the Fascist period. He himself went on claiming a simple dedication to objectivity 
and the truth revealed in documents. As he had advised modestly in 1975, "before we can 
define Fascism we must first write its history."34 Unlike Ledeen,35 he avoided overt 
political commitment. But, during the Christmas-New Year period of 1987-88, originally 
prompted by a public controversy that followed an official meeting between the then 
seemingly triumphant Prime Minister, the anti-communist Socialist Bettino Craxi, and 
the young leader of the neo-Fascist "Italian Social movement" (MSI), Gianfranco Fini, 
De Felice did clarify the relevance of his work and thus underlined what his representation 
of the past meant for the Italian present.
</p>
<p>In a series of interviews De Felice pronounced the death of AntiFascism as an ideology 
and as a guide to contemporary life. Mussolini's regime was not responsible for genocide, 
he declared, and the communists had no particular claim to have saved Italy from Fascism. 
The Fascist bureaucracy had had its faults but he could not see that it was any worse 
than that of the Italian Republic in which he said the only two serious political forces 
for the future were Craxi and some Christian Democratic youth movements (and thus demonstrated, 
yet again, what inadequate prophets historians usually are). All in all, De Felice told 
a journalist from Corriere della Sera: "Anti-Fascism understood as an ideology of state 
is not, in a historical or a political or a civil sense, a proper discriminator which can 
establish democratic authenticity."36 No wonder Gianfranco Fini, who was still securing 
his place as leader of the heirs of Fascism, declared gratefully that De Felice's wisdom 
had ensured that "the dopoguerra is over and done with" and that "after De Felice, no one 
can think of Fascism as a hell fallen on Italy."37
</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that, for all Berlusconi' s occupation of the media and for 
all his expectation of "hegemony," Italy remains a place of many voices, a functioning 
cultural democracy. However, it is also true that De Felice's alleged "objectifying" of 
Fascism has very much fostered the decline of the Italian Left to its current parlous 
condition. Without the ethical impulse of the "myth" of the Resistance to Fascism and 
the ideas of social justice it proclaimed, the Left has lost a past and not yet discovered 
a future. Although its record doubtless always contained some equivocations, the most 
evident victim of these processes has been the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Today it' 
is known instead as the Partito Democratico di Sinistra (Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS), even if, as a sort of furtive attempt to retain product-recognition, for a time 
it let its old name peep out on its new standard, where the hammer and sickle of yesteryear 
(even if patriotically backed by the green, white and red of the national flag) were 
almost obliterated by an oak tree. This tree is a choice of symbol of extraordinary irony, 
presumably appealing vaguely to environmentalists, but mainly trying to proclaim that 
the PDS, stalwart as an oak, is a bearer of longevity, national longevity, and of history, 
a "genuine," "popular," national, history. Its Anti-Fascist history no longer relevant 
and all but excised from some scholarly books and public discourse, the PCUPDS is left 
to rely on an advertising message, an etichetta. But, in advertising, how could such an 
enfeebled and confused construction of the past compete with the images crafted either by 
a real master of virtual reality, and of all that is newer than new, like Berlusconi  or,  
indeed,  with  so apparently  straight-forward, commonsensical and patriotic a marketer 
of politics as Gianfranco Fini?
</p>
<p>We turn now the vast Union of Socialist Soviet Republics where the fate of Communists 
of Italy is writ large. The decline and fall of the Soviet Union is a tale of a society 
losing its past just before it became completely plain that it had no future. Those bits 
of the past to which, for example, Gorbachev clung, as his "revolution" swept him along, 
were in the final analysis two in number—the Revolution of 1917 and the Second World War, 
the "Great Patriotic War." A.J.P. Taylor once sagely warned that "there was no such thing 
as the Second World War in the abstract. There was a war in relation to each country and 
each of these wars was different."38 His comment usefully bolsters the thesis, already 
advanced in this paper, that cultural and political life 1945-1990 was scoured by a contest 
for the historical ownership of the Second World War (both "long" and short). Certainly 
that Soviet regime, in which a type of Stalinism would stubbornly survive the death of the 
dictator and in which the Brezhnevs and Chernenkos seem literally to embody the familiar 
refrain that "old [Stalinist] soldiers never die, they only fade away," was inseparable 
from its version of the war.39
</p>
<p>Of course the Soviet Union had many reasons to claim the war as its own. Though its 
leadership for a number of years tried to conceal the extent of its casualties, speaking 
of seven million dead when the real figure was twenty, or, maybe, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, 
or even more, million, recent historians have recalled that, in 1944 after the Western 
allies landed in Normandy on D-Day, for example, the Soviets were killing more than 200,000 
Germans a month on the Eastern front at a time when Nazi casualties in the West totaled 
some 8000 a month.4° Even if American "Lend Lease" provided some twenty percent of the 
Soviet economy in 1943-44,4' the Herculean war effort required to expel the Nazi invaders 
was very much that of the Soviet regime and/or of the Soviet people. As Stalin would 
put it in February 1946—in words which pre-figured the concept later advanced by British 
historian, Arthur Marwick, that war is the ultimate "test" of a modern state and society—
the defeat of the Nazis was "a great school of testing and verification of all the people's 
forces...an examination for our Soviet system, our state, our government, our Communist 
party."42 It was a war effort which, still in 1996, has not been well explained, given the 
many obvious brutalities and incompetencies of the Stalinist system, and given the way 
the invaders seem at first to have been accepted as liberators by considerable sections 
of the Soviet populace.43
</p>
<p>One notable obstacle to the communist regime's ambition to monopolize the history of 
the war, and to assert the primacy of Russia's Great Patriotic sacrifices, was the Jews, 
those who lived in the Soviet Union, those who, after 1945, survived in the Soviet satellites,
 and those who had found refuge in Israel, in the United States and in other parts of the 
 West. Soviet historiography downplayed Jewish suffering—it was not until 1960 that Anne 
 Frank's diary was made available to Soviet readers,44 while the Auschwitz site in Poland 
 notoriously memorialized all the victims of fascism rather than singling out the million 
 or more Jews who had died there:13 The official Soviet line continued to contest the views 
 of Zionist historians like Lucy Dawidowicz that the Second World War, and, in fact, the 
 whole Nazi regime, began and ended as a "war against the Jews."46 Indeed, a theme of the 
 Cold War, a theme which was, if anything, still increasing in importance in the 1980s, 
 was precisely this radical and often macabre disagreement over who had suffered the worst, 
 over who had the history of the Second World War on its side and, thus, over who had 
 most earned the war's blessing.</p>
<p>
 The great symbol of the Soviet regime's determination to learn only one lesson in the 
 history of the war was its official textbook, the History of the Communist Party of 
 the Soviet Union/Bolsheviks/ Short Course. At Stalin's death, there had been 301 
 editions of this work and 42,816,000 copies had been printed in a total of 67 languages.47 
 Although criticized in 1956 and, from time to time, revised, and despite the fact 
 that the Soviet historical profession could engage in its own lively debates on 
 some issues, this manual, with its single and unimpeachable history, was still casting 
 a long shadow when Gorbachev took over.
</p>
<p>Gorbachev's economic and then political reforms were soon accompanied by cultural 
change. First in literature, theater, and film, and only later in historiography—
presumably because history was such a visceral discipline for the Soviet state—new 
voices were heard and old ideas were challenged and then, reluctantly, abandoned. 
There was an almost bathetic slide into exonerating first this and then that victim 
of Stalinism. By January 1988, Gorbachev himself was declaring that it was "impossible 
to agree with those who propose to forget history or to utilize only a certain part 
of it," and one of his supporters mused shortly thereafter: "Learning the truth about 
history is difficult work, it stings many people to the quick."48 The sting was 
bringing not just difficulty but death for texts and for a whole regime. In April 1988, 
Yuri Afanas'ev, a radical who had gained recognition as a historian of the Annales, 
stated roundly: "there is not and has never been in the world a people and a country 
with such a falsified history as ours."49 Action followed words. In May 1988, 
secondary school history exams in the Soviet Empire were canceled on the grounds that 
the textbook was out of date. Izvestia explained: "Even the best and more inquisitive 
teachers... [had] presented the history of our homeland in a monstrously distorted 
and unrecognizable form."5° Leningrad, City of the Revolution, of the 1941-43 siege 
and of Shostakovitch' s 7th Symphony, reverted to the St Petersburg it had been before 
1914. History in the Soviet Union was over (and the promised new standard textbook 
would never appear).
</p>
<p>In his contemporary account of these events, R.W. Davies concluded that the 
experience of the Soviet Union in casting out its history was unique: "nothing 
like this has ever happened in the history of the world."5' From a comparative 
perspective it is easy to see that Davies was exaggerating. What the Soviet Union 
was going through historiographically did bear some similarity with the experience 
of the other ex-combatant states of the Second World War. The sense of dislocation 
and of a story being "untrue" was the greater in the Soviet Union because the 
revisionism had taken so much longer to arrive there. It was the greater, too, 
because the Soviet elite, frozen in its own experience of the "long" Second World 
War, had each year allowed the gap to grow more yawning between the hope maintained 
in the regime's "history" and the decline evident in its "reality." Stalin once 
remarked contemptuously: "Who, save hopeless bureaucrats, can rely on written 
documents alone? Who, besides archive rats, does not understand that a party and 
its leaders must be tested primarily by their deeds and not by their declarations."52 
Ironically, by 1989-90, Gorbachev was left only with the words of a history which 
did not make sense; as a party historian then mused with splendid naiveté, "at the 
moment we still do not have the answer."53 Nor, since 1990, has the magic recipe 
been found. Rather, all the Russias remain places where memory, both of communism 
and of noncommunism, may well be "dangerous"54 and where, as one historian has 
wryly put it, "the past cannot be predicted."55
</p>
<p>No doubt the USSR was particularly stubborn in its refusal to engage in a "collective 
self-analysis" of its history. Its representations of the past were particularly 
crude and inadequate. But the Soviet Union was by no means the only society which 
preferred to keep its myths of the Second World War simple rather than subjecting 
them to too much debate. To conclude this brief over-view paper let me turn to the 
examples of France and Japan.
</p>
<p>Of all post-Second World War histories, France's is in many ways the most remarkable. 
Germany, Japan and even Italy may have transmuted the dross of defeat into the gold 
of economic advance but France experienced a different but still more dramatic 
transmutation. From the nation which, so utterly and so humiliatingly, given its 
"history," collapsed in 1940 and which did not much recover in 1940-44 (nor, arguably, 
in 194446), from the nation which seemed to have given definition to "Year Nought," 
France has become the great cultural victor since 1945. De Beauvoir, Sartre, Levi-Strauss, 
Barthes, Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Iragary, Kristeva, the names run on and 
on and compose an intellectual (and, indeed, imperial) galaxy of a brightness unequaled 
by any other national intelligentsia. Similarly Paris has been the home of what is 
widely accepted as the "greatest history journal in the world," the Annales ESC. Fernand 
Braudel, the author who would cheerfully accept the responsibility of a "weighing up of 
the world,"56 and who preached the need to write "histoire totale," was, before his 
death in 1985, acknowledged in many places as the world's best historian." Repaired by 
the balm of these cultural achievements, the "Fall of France" has been obliterated in 
the world's memory and replaced by the manifest gloire of a cultural imperium on which 
the sun never sets. What is to be made of this disjunction? How did France restabilize 
itself historiographically after the apparently terrible disruption of defeat, 
collaboration and la guerre franco-francaise?
</p>
<p>Marc Ferro, a third generation editor of the Annales, and unusual in that journal for 
his interest in contemporary history, has observed that "to control the past is to master 
the present, to legitimize dominion and to justify legal claims."58 But when an 
investigator asks how France has controlled the history of its "long"59 Second World 
War, there is a paradoxical answer. The most authoritative attempt to trace the 
lineaments of this paradox is Henry Rousso's Le syndrome de Vichy (1987). Rousso has 
provided a graph of the neurosis he has detected in France's reviewing of its past.6° 
It displays something which by now ought not to be unfamiliar to a reader of this paper. 
After an initial obsession with the events of the war and its aftermath, for almost a 
generation, from the mid1950s to 	1971, France largely forgot about its recent past. 
Here, as elsewhere, the history of the war was swiftly made as comfortable and morally 
straightforward as possible. For the majority, contemporary history meant the Gaullist 
legend of a good French people resisting, to a man and a woman, from beginning to end, 
and of a people absolutely uncontaminated by the Holocaust, except for those few villains 
who rightly paid a price in the post-war purges. As Stanley Hoffmann has explained, De 
Gaulle "was a firm believer in pedagogical sublimation: the French had to be turned 
forward, to effort and greatness, not backward to a morose and divisive analysis of 
their failings or crimes."61 De Gaulle himself, and, eventually, the political order 
of the Fifth Republic, would embody a France which, except in simple and controlled 
patriotic celebrations, excised "Year Nought" out of its public memory, just as surely 
as it had overcome the old divisions between those for and those against the French 
Revolution, divisions which had so marked French history since 1789, and which had, 
indeed, helped to explain the nation's psychological "fall" in 1940.
</p>
<p>In so doing the Gaullists were assisted by the Annales, or at least by those 
historians who accepted the leadership of Braudel. Braudel and his theoretics made 
the time of 1940-44 a little thing, a trifling "event" before the greater power of 
the structure and the longue duree. Braudel, along with his "scientific" history, 
preached a patriotism, an "eternal" France62 and an acceptance of very strict 
limits to human free will in pursuit of change. Braudel, as a sort of intellectual 
testimony, stated, in contradiction to the Marx of The Eighteenth Brumaire: "men 
do not make history, rather it is history above all that makes men and thereby absolves 
them from blame."63
</p>
<p>Such a learned, if self-interested, basis for forgetting may have served for 
a while. Rousso's graph, however, moves upwards again after 1968, that is, while 
the Fifth Republic was endeavoring to work out whether its institutions could 
survive the end of De Gaulle's own political career (and when Braudel, "boss" of 
the second generation of the Annales, handed over the editorship of his journal 
to the "third"). The immediate trigger for renewed debate about France's "long" 
Second World War was not a history book but a film, Marcel Ophuls' Le Chagrin et 
la Pitie.64 When a critical history book bearing some resemblance to Griff nach 
der Weltmacht or The origins of the Second World War did appear, it would be written 
by Robert Paxton, an American.65 The works by Ophuls and Paxton did mark a certain 
turning-point with parallels to what had happened in Germany and Britain a decade 
earlier. And, in the subsequent twenty years, a debate has continued about the meaning 
of the war-time French regime in Vichy, though I would doubt Rousso's reading of 
its intensity. Rather, a comparative analysis indicates that the French history 
profession's contribution to our understanding of the general crisis of the "long" 
Second World War is decidedly minor and thus, in this special field, inferior to 
the overall cultural success of the French intelligentsia and, more specifically, of 
the Annales.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the successes which should be most remarked. It would be churlish 
to doubt the contribution of the Annales in so many historical fields, or to deny 
its "span" of interests and method. Post-communist Europe today is particularly 
attracted by the Annales, at least partially because of its assertion that politics 
is, as Ferro put it, often "a kind of shadow-play ."66 The Braudellian concept of 
the structural majesty of the longue duree, before which the events of one or two 
generations are of evanescent significance, also has an obvious appeal for those 
anxious to cancel Marxism-Leninism from their history. And yet, for all its triumphant 
export industry in these and other ideas, there is also something rather troubling 
about France's continuing reticence about some aspects of its "long" Second World 
War. Such trouble was incarnated by Francois Mitterrand, that socialiste sans 
doctrine, with his own doubtful past and ambiguous present.67 Despite the hopes of 
some of his supporters, whatever it was that Mitterrand brought to power 1981-95, 
it was not a clearsighted reading of French history. Nor have Mitterrand' s defeat 
and death clarified matters. Rather, present French politics are dominated by Jacques 
Chirac, a Gaullist determined to forget nothing and remember nothing (though perhaps 
per force vulnerable to the appeal of "free market" economics), and by Jean-Marie 
Le Pen, the man of the Right who has long written off the gas chambers as a "minor 
point in the history of World War II." Generally, then, French politics in the 1990s 
remain unmoored to any credible, or at least any appealing, pasts, and France, 
relying more on the nostalgia of memory68 than the criticism of history, confronts 
a political future of an uncertainty comparable to Italy's.
</p>
<p>Another polity in a state of high ambiguity is Japan, that economic wonder of 
the modern world, or at least of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Japan, of course, 
experienced very much its own version of a "long" Second World War, even if it was 
one which culminated in the bombs which fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and which, 
therefore, simultaneously carries a universal significance. Part of the story of 
this Japanese war is the conflict after Pearl Harbor with the United States, a 
conflict which recent historiography, not altogether convincingly, has been seeking 
to define as a struggle between "enemies of a kind."69 Perhaps the more troubling 
area of Japan's history is domestic, and covers the imposition of those policies 
which have been felicitously described as "cool fascism."7° Internationally, the 
greater issue is not so much Japan's wartime policy towards the United States 
(or Australia) but rather the imperial regime's campaigns against its Asian 
neighbors, disfigured, as they were, by a brutality which ranged from a medieval 
style sacking of cities to germ warfare to the gross exploitation of "comfort 
women."
</p>
<p>An extended review of Japanese historiography on these issues is not possible 
here. But the Japanese representation of this difficult past carries two or three 
major themes. The first is the superficial virtue, or utility, of forgetting. 
Silence about the "long" Second World War has hidden the fact that, for all its 
"Americanization," "democratic" Japan was a place of many continuities, best 
symbolized by the survival of wartime Emperor Hirohito himself. Moreover, the 
bureaucrats of "democratic" Japan remained almost completely unreconstructed 
figures and those in charge of education have never accepted that textbooks should 
suggest any criticism of national policies, or that history, if it is to have 
any humanist purpose in a modern society, must foster debate and accept and endorse 
a certain social "disunity." With the collapse of the Soviet Union and its myths 
of the Great Patriotic War, Japan is now the society which remains most impervious 
to historiographical change, the country in which the initial interpretation of 
the catastrophes of 1941-45 is still the authoritative one.71
</p>
<p>Critics of this bureaucratized and homogenized history there have always been, 
notably from within Japanese universities' history departments, and, more erratically, 
from within Japan's socialist party. Since the death of Hirohito, such voices 
have been heard more regularly, or with less overt condemnation, than in the past. 
Emperor Akihito himself has, on a number of occasions, expressed his sorrow over 
Japan's brutal treatment of its neighbors, even though Japanese textbooks have 
certainly not abandoned their conservatism and patriotism. To a distant observer 
present-day Japanese historiography thus seems to exhibit a new uncertainty which 
parallels the apparent confusion of contemporary Japanese politics. Japan's postwar 
era may well be over, but just what will replace it politically and economically, 
and what it will rely on culturally and historiographically, are not yet clear. 
Japan's past and future are as clouded as is its present.</p>
<p> 
I began this paper by seeking to study the ways in which historians have sought to 
represent and explain the "long" Second World War, now that we have passed the 
fiftieth anniversaries of its end. Though there were many diverse second World 
wars, each conflict, and the knowledge that each was part of a whole, had a searing 
impact on those who came after; each ex-combatant society had its "syndrome," 
induced by the recollection of war and "resistance," of tyranny and a mass and 
civilian killing unknown in previous times. Each society lived self-consciously after 
Auschwitz and Hiroshima, incapable altogether of forgetting its history and, in 
that sense, dependent on historians to find a way to "explain" this past.
</p>
<p>Historians by no means were always free agents, however. Their histories were as 
"written" by their societies, and by those societies' pasts, presents and futures, 
as by the individuals concerned. In most instances there was soon a numbness about 
the appalling past, and this numbness could easily be adapted by conservatives 
(including Stalinist conservatives) to their own political ends which usually 
entailed obscuring the part they had played in engendering the catastrophe. But, 
because of the Resistance and because the Second World Wars were in part "people's 
wars," and wars which had been won for and by the people, new interpretations of 
this past soon appeared, often with initial controversy, but often also with the 
effect of further assisting democratic reforms and of facilitating the construction 
and expansion of the Welfare State.
</p>
<p>In their turn, these critical accounts fell under attack, as the Right regained 
its confidence and resumed its "natural" political authority. Conservatives became 
newly aggressive in deploring the wickedness and irresponsibility of the Left. By 
the mid to late 1980s, Lucy Dawidowicz, battling to keep "pure" her Second World War 
as a conflict wholly defined by being "against the Jews 1933-1945," averred "today 
the worldwide anti-Semitism of the Left has become if anything more open and 
unmistakable."'" Alan Bloom complained more simply that students were nefariously 
being indoctrinated with the view that men and women in the past were always wrong." 
Gertrude Himmelfarb thought that "new historians," among whom, remarkably, she 
numbered Braudel, were fragmenting the present even as they fragmented the past:74
</p>
<p>In the main, however, this refreshed Right, sometimes with the playful and 
unreliable backing of radical post-modernists, was not especially preoccupied with 
history. As far as its devotees were concerned, economics offered the most reliable 
way to predict and thus comprehend the future." As Henry Rousso commented: "now that 
history no longer has the purpose of forging a national identity, it has no 
therapeutic value, and, in the short term, at least, it often has the effect of 
perpetuating old divisions." But, he added: "World War II...gave birth to the world 
as we know it today. The birth occurred not only in pain but in alienation and 
division." It would be my contention that, as much of the history of the Second World 
War slips into the theme park or into oblivion, historians will do something to put 
off the horror of an "end of historiography" while they go on exploring the meaning 
of these terrible events and while, in free and fragile debate, they keep arguing about 
those divisions, that alienation and that pain.

Appendix
</p>
<p>Not a Foreign Country
Nations Need to Know Themselves and Confront Their Pasts
</p>
<p>For nations as for people, denial of the past can be corrupting. The more unpleasant 
the face in the mirror, the more vital it is to look at it. "Never again" and "know 
thyself" remain handy maxims for just about every country under the sun. None is without 
skeletons. But how to overcome a natural reluctance to take them out of the cupboard?
</p>
<p>The Germans have achieved a remarkable feat of collective self-analysis and contrition. 
That painful process—still going on, with the viewing in Germany of the film "Schindler' s 
List"—has helped to create an exemplary democracy and a nation generally sensitive to the 
fears of foreigners.
</p>
<p>The Russians have done less well. True, during the Gorbachev era, the belated 
exposure of crimes committed in the name of a totalitarian regime played a valuable 
part in bringing the collapse of communism. True, Russian historians can now dig in 
the archives and reveal the horrors that were kept out of the national consciousness, 
and therefore its conscience. But there is still no public self-examination, in the 
German manner, of the extent to which millions of Russians were complicit in Stalin's 
crimes.
</p>
<p>Other countries have found it no easier to master the art of mea culpa. Japan's 
just exprime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, courageously admitted a wider measure of 
collective guilt for Japanese war crimes, but the Japanese have yet to look that 
history straight in the eye. Italy's crimes during the fascist era were less horrific 
in scale, but as a nation Italy has avoided the kind of collective self-analysis 
engaged in by the Germans.
</p>
<p>The task of self-examination is even harder in countries, such as France, where 
the post-1945 issue is not so much the initiation of crimes as collaboration in the 
crimes of others. The wounds caused by brother betraying brother often go deeper 
than those inflicted by an external foe. So it is understandable that politicians, 
from de Gaulle to Mitterrand, should wish to draw a veil over the squalor and dwell 
instead upon la gloire. Yet when the victors look back this summer to celebrate 
their D-day landings 50 years ago, their view of the past will surely be more honest 
than it would have been had not Paul Touvier, a Frenchman, just been convicted of 
wartime crimes against humanity. Whatever the shortcomings of a trial so long after 
the event, the introspection it has inspired should help to stifle the crowing.</p>
<p>
Raking over the past is never pleasant, but to forget the lessons of history is worse. 
Nationalism, racism, and hostility to immigrants have risen in much of Europe. 
Mussolini's heirs are coming back to government in Italy. Vladimir Zhirinovsky has 
done alarmingly well in Russia. This is a time to remember the evils of rampant 
nationalism, not to forget them.
</p>
<p>
The road to understanding
</p>
<p>National pride is not ignoble. But the line between pride in valor and gloating 
triumphalism should be clear. Old soldiers who actually fought on the beaches know 
where to draw it; their fond memories are invariably tempered by solemnity and 
sadness, if only for fallen friends. Next year, when the peace of 1945 is marked, 
the emphasis will rightly shift to reconciliation.
</p>
<p>Pride, in any event, should be matched with sober self-knowledge. The place to 
start is in rigorously frank textbooks at school. Lest they be smug, Britons 
hould tell their children candidly about the ill-treatment of Irish and colonial 
peoples, just as Americans should pull no punches about Indians and slavery. The 
next place for conscience-pricking is in an inquisitive press. Best of all are 
leaders, like President von Weizsacker of Germany, who foster national honesty 
about historical guilt. If the past is indeed to be a place where they do things 
differently, it must be recognized that it is not a foreign country.

<p>Notes
</p>
<p>1. 	The editorial writer remembered the title of David Lowenthal's, The Past Is a Foreign Country (Cambridge, 1985), though he or she was modemistically anxious to detect "the lessons of history" from it and other sources.
2. 	Naturally, I develop this argument more fully in R.J.B. Bosworth, Explaining Auschwitz and Hiroshima: History Writing and the Second World War 1945-1990, London, 1993.
3.	See appendix.
4.	Actually, the journalist did think the British and the Americans had things to
worry about in their pasts (imperialism, slavery etc.). They just were not matters directly relating to the "long" Second World War.
5.	E.H. Carr, What is History? (Harmondsworth, 1964), 95.
6.	Most recently by J. Winter, Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: the Great War
in European Cultural History (Cambridge, 1995). Winter's account of commemorating and mourning the First war is based on a sense of the impossibility of doing this for the Second.
7. 	In so arguing I am disagreeing with those commentators who aver that the authority of the Second World War was rapidly ousted by that of the Cold War. Joyce Appleby and her colleagues have urged that a "new Republic of learning' is possible since the end of the Cold War. As far as they are concerned this event also entailed the end of the way in which 'throughout the globe, for forty years, rigid categories of right and left have polarized all thinking about society both between nations and within those societies where free speech was tolerated." [J. Appleby, L. Hunt and M. Jacob, Telling the Truth about History (New York, 1994), 272.] Such comments seem to me to reflect a very American perspective and to underline the fact that, for the USA, the "long" Second World War did not constitute the visceral crisis which it did for other combatants. The US did not in any sense arrive at Year Nought in 1945 (and, in 1994, a new republic of learning sounded disturbingly like a "new world order" for intellectuals in general and historians in particular).
8. 	But note Georg Iggers' acute comment on the large and increasing significance of a "correct" reading of history for the East German regime: there, he has noted, "history occupied a very important role second only to Marxism-Leninism in the hierarchy of academic disciplines because of the special function it served in legitimizing their regime."

Taylor: a Non-conforming Radical Historian of Europe," both in Contemporary European History, 3 (1994), 61-72, 73-86 and cf. the very different biographical studies by R. Cole, A.J.P. Taylor: the Traitor Within the Gates (London, 1993) which is dull, literal and "scholarly," and A. Sisman, A.J.P. Taylor: A Biography (London, 1994) which is lively, personal and "journalistic."
20. 	A.J.P. Taylor, "War Origins Again," as re-printed from the 	1965 Past and Present article in reply to Tim Mason, in E.M. Robertson (ed.), The Origins of the Second World War: Historical Interpretations (London, 1971), 140. Taylor would then also note in modest goak: "I am an old-fashioned, hack historian." (141).
 21. 	Taylor also, characteristically, was troubled by the glibness of Carr's optimism. For the review, see A.J.P. Taylor, Politicians, Socialism and Historians (London, 1980), 53-55.
22. 	See, e.g., C. Barnett, The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Power (London, 1986); The Lost Victory: British Dreams, British Realities, 194550 (London, 1995).
23. 	Clive Ponting has recalled that R.A. Butler, that quintessential appeaser, stated in 1939: "In my political life I have always been convinced that we can no more count on America than on Brazil" and, in May 1940, on Churchill's accession, he complained: "the good clear tradition of English politics...had been sold to the greatest adventurer in modem political history...a half-breed American."

25. 	For a case study in this regard, compare and contrast, A. Calder, The People's War: Britain 1939-45 (London, 1969) and his The Myth of the Blitz (London, 1991).
26. 	I owe this detail to R. Ben-Ghiat, "Fascism, Writing, and Memory: the Realist Aesthetic in Italy, 1930-50", Journal of Modern History, 67 (1995), 627-665.
27. 	For far and away the best analysis of the ambiguities of this time, see C. Pavone, Una guerra civile: saggio storico sulla morality nella Resistenza (Turin, 1991). The usage of the term "civil war" is not without its dangers, however. They are well exemplified in an interview with De Felice published in 1995 in which the historian seemed almost regretful that Fascist Italy failed to win the Second World War. See R. De Felice, Rosso e nero (Milan, 1995). For Pavone's own, more sensible thoughts on these matters, cf. Passato e presente della resistenza: cinquantesimo anniversario della Resistenza e della guerra di liberazione (Rome, nd), 111-16.
28.	F. Chabod, A History of Italian Fascism (London, 1963), 84.
29.	For my own reading of this film, see R. Bosworth, "Bemardo Bertolucci, 1900
and the Myth of Fascism," European History Quarterly, 19 (1989), 37-61.
30. 	See, e.g., M. Ledeen, "Aldo Moro's legacy," New Republic, 178 (13 May 1978) and cf. his Italy in Crisis (Beverly Hills, 1977). At around the same time, Walter Laqueur, who was assisting Ledeen's career, argued, with extraordinary exaggeration, that, as a result of the De Felice controversy, "some foreign observers even reached the conclusion that the Gleichschaltung, something akin to self-Finlandisation, had already taken place and that it was a foretaste of how much political and cultural freedom would ultimately survive under a government with communist participation." W.  Laqueur, "'Eurocommunism' and Its Friends," Commentary, 62 (August 1976), 30.
31. 	The first volume of De Felice's biography was published in 1965. Thirty years later, after 4 volumes (3 with 2 parts) and more than 5600 pages, the last volume is still awaited. It is typical of De Felice that his "introductory" bibliography on Fascism should list 12,208 items. R. De Felice (ed.), Bibliografia orientativa del fascismo (Rome, 1991).
32. 	In 	1976, Michael Ledeen acted as De Felice's interviewer in a summary Intervista sul fascismo. For its English-language version, see R. De Felice, Fascism: An Informal Introduction to Its Theory and Practice (New Brunswick, NJ: 1976). Ledeen, it was alleged with considerable ingenuousness or cynicism, acted as interviewer to avoid the "bias" inevitable in an Italian.
33. 	For a recent, and still largely uncritical, example, see B.W. Painter, "Renzo De Felice and the Historiography of Italian Fascism," American Historical Review, 95 (1990), 391-405, and cf. the portentous, if not necessarily convincing, explication of the
 De Felice line in N. Zapponi, "Fascism in Italian Historiography, 	1986-93: A Fading National Identity,' Journal of Contemporary History, 29 (1994), 547-68.
34. 	R. De Felice, Interpretations of Fascism (Cambridge MA: 1977), 153. He was quoting views expressed by Angelo Tasca in 1938.
35. 	Among other interests, for example in the Middle East, Ledeen became particularly associated with the "new man" of Italian politics of that decade, Bettino Craxi. For his own versions, see, e.g., M. Ledeen, Grave New World (New York, 1985); Perilous statecraft: An Insider's Account of the Iran-Contra Affair (New York, 1988).

38.	A.J.P. Taylor, Letters to Eva 1969-1983 (London, 1991), 87. Taylor regularly
stated the "real" Second World War was that of 1941 	(June and December), not the "little" war of 1939 or 1940.
39. 	For a lively study of the memorialization of the Great Patriotic War, see N. Tumarkin, The Living and the Dead: The Rise and Fall of the Cult of the Second World War in Russia (New York, 1994).

42. 	Cited by M. Harrison, "Stalinist Industrialization and the Test of War," History Workshop, 29 (1990), 66. Harrison noted as well that Gorbachev in October 1987 used very much the same language: —The aggression imposed upon us was a pitiless examination of the viability of the socialist structure, the fortitude of the multinational Soviet state and the strength of patriotic feeling of Soviet peoples. And we passed this examination by fire and sword, comrades' (prolonged applause)."
43. 	For a recent example of the avoidance of explanation even by a particularly acute historian, see S. Fitzpatrick, Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village after Collectivization (New York, 1994). This book tells a moving but ultimately bleak tale of the peasants' hostility to Stalin and all his works, and of the same peasants' "demoralization." Its chronology, however, ends before Fitzpatrick is obliged to explain the war effort of that same peasantry. For an earlier paper of hers on this subject, see "War and Society in Soviet Context: Soviet Labor Before, During and after World War II," International and Working-Class History, 35 (1989), 37-52. She then concluded: "For forty years the Soviet Union has been remembering and memorializing the war as the nation's [sic] central shared experience, an affirmation of its spiritual strength, common purpose, and claim to the respect and admiration of the world." (48).
44. 	B. Pinkus, The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority (Cambridge, 1988), 282. Pinkus notes that, to some extent, the regime's initial reluctance to "give credit" to Jewish suffering may have had a "genuine popular base" in the sense that the leadership feared too much recognition to the Jews might have engendered a traditionally Anti-Semitic response from a populace reluctant to share its war, and its suffering, with anyone.
45. 	For a case study of a Lithuanian moment of forgetfulness in which the local Jews can be said to have died twice, see E.T. Linenthal, "The Boundaries of Memory: The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum," American Quarterly, 46 (1994) 412-5, and cf. his splendidly textured account of Washington's memorialization of the Holocaust.
