<b><center>Phan Boi Chau (1867-1940)<br>
<br>
The New Vietnam (1907)</center></b><br>
<br>
<i>Phan Hoi Chau, more than anyone else in the history of the first quarter of twentieth-century Vietnam, personifies the struggle against French colonialism. He was trained in the traditional Confucian system of education and earned the equivalent of an M.A. degree (cu nhan) in 1900. The Dong Du, or Going East (Japan), movement, organized in 1904, was the first important anticolonial movement that Phan Boi Chau actively and directly promoted. Subsequently, he was involved in numerous campaigns, all aiming at gaining independence for his country. What, however, contributed mainly to Phan Boi Chau's greatness was that from abroad he inundated his people with countless pamphlets dealing with all kinds of subjects, ranging from the pains of losing ones own country to the joy and comforts attained with independence. All, however, to no avail. In 1925 the French colonial authorities arrested, tried and condemned Phan Boi Chau to death for subversion. The sentence was, however, commuted, and Phan Boi Chau spent the next fifteen years of his life under close surveillance in Hue. A memorandum preserved in his personal file at the French Colonial Archives defines quite well the complex and contradictory nature of his confined life. A French officer wrote that Phan Boi Chau, in exchange for a commutation of his death sentence, had promised to behave with loyalty toward the French colonial government. Another official, also French, appended the following comment, naturally, on the same memorandum: "He hasn't given any value to his words."[1]<br>
<br>
In the following document, Tan Viet Nam (New Vietnam), Phan Boi Chau describes to his compatriots how life would look and feel after Vietnam has been modernized and consequently regained her independence from France. This document somewhat constitutes the platform for the new movement Phan Boi Chau founded about this time, the Duy Tan Hoi, or Modernization Association.[2]</i><br>
<br>
<b>(p.105)</b> After a thousand kilometers of railroads have been laid, merchandise to be exchanged would reach its destination in hours, sprawling cities and large <b>(p.106)</b> villages would promptly communicate with one another, then even if we were to relax in a sculpted house or if we were just to sit on a flowered mat, it would still feel as though we have scaled mountains and crossed rivers. What a wonderful sensation that will be! But to attain that goal we must first go through worries and pains. How come, when we talk about difficulties, we just cross our arms and remain silent? That's simply because we do not know how marvelous we will feel after the railroad laying has been completed.<br>
<br>
After a building a thousand meters high has been erected, we shall be able to hold in our hands the stars in the sky and the moon in the sea. Fresh air and wind will flow through our feet. Then, even if we were to relax sitting on a stone bench or if we were just to remain enclosed within four walls, we would still be able to see hundreds of islands in the five continents. What a wonderful feeling that will be! To attain that goal we must first make plans and estimate costs. How come, when we talk about great tasks such as these, we bow our heads and lose the color on our faces? Because we simply don't know how marvelous we will feel after the high-rise has been built.<br>
<br>
To know that, in the future, our pleasure will be endless may encourage us to bear today's difficulties, which will bring us that pleasure to come. To know that, in the future, our joy will be endless may encourage us to bear today's pains, which will bring us that joy to come. To know that in the future the profit will be immense may encourage us to bear today's costs, which will bring us that profit to come. <br>
<br>
Now I would like to tell you this, my compatriots. If we wanted a New Vietnam, we must bear the difficulties, the pains, and the costs involved. If our compatriots are unwilling to bear the difficulties, the pains, and the costs involved, it is because they simply to do not know that Vietnam, after her modernization, will bring them sheer pleasure, joy, and profit. <br>
<br>
The Ten Pleasant Conditions<br>
<br>
Now I would like to tell you, my compatriots, about the ten pleasant conditions resulting from modernization. They are;<br>
<br>
1. No protecting power.<br>
2. No obnoxious mandarins.<br>
3. No dissatisfied citizens.<br>
4. No soldier without glory.<br>
5. No unequal taxes or forced labor.<br>
6. No unjust law.<br>
7. No imperfect education system.<br>
8. No unexploited mineral resources.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.107)</b><br>
<br>
9. No neglected industry.<br>
10. No losing commercial ventures.<br>
<br>
<i>1. No Protecting Power</i><br>
<br>
Our country has an area of 250,000 square miles: that is not a small country. Our population amounts to more than fifty million inhabitants: that is not a negligible number.[2] Our soil is fertile, our mountains and rivers beautiful. Compared with other powers in the five continents, our country is inferior only to a few. Why, then, do we suffer French protection? Alas, that is simply because of our deep-rooted slave mentality; it is because of our inveterate habit of depending on others for over two thousand years. We gladly accepted the colonization of the Han, the Tang, the Song, the Yuan, the Ming. As slaves, we served them; we lacked human dignity. Today our enemy the French are very ingenious. They despise us, claiming that we are weak; they lie to us, because they consider us stupid. While our guardian, the lion, is in deep sleep, they act like bandits, oppressing the masters of the house. They trample over our people; they hold our fathers and brothers in contempt; they treat us like buffaloes and horses; they suck the sweat and blood from our people; and yet they dare broadcast loudly to the rest of the world that France is here to protect the Indochinese country. Oh! Compatriots, the country is ours; the people are ours. What interest does France have here for her to come and protect our country?<br>
<br>
Ever since France came to protect us, Frenchmen hold every lever of power; they hold the power of life and death over everyone. The life of thousands of Vietnamese people is not worth that of a French dog: the moral prestige of hundreds of our officials does not prevail over that of a French woman. Look at those men with blue eyes and yellow beard. They are not our fathers, nor are they our brothers. How can they squat here, defecating on our heads? Are the men from Vietnam not ashamed of that situation? As long as our bodies remain able, we should try to flatten the crest of the open ocean; we should be determined to kill the enemy in order to raise the energy of the yellow race of ours.<br>
<br>
After modernization we shall determine the domestic as well as foreign affairs of our country. The work of civilization will go on, day after day, and our country's status in the world will be heightened. We shall have three million infantrymen, as fierce as tigers looking into the four corners of the universe. Five hundred thousand of our navy men, as terrifying as crocodiles, will swim freely in the boundless ocean. We shall send ambassadors into every country of Europe, America, Japan, the United States, Germany, England. <br>
<br>
These countries will make ours their first ally. Siam, India, and other countries <b>(p.108)</b> of the South Seas will look up to our land as an enlightened example. Even the big countries of Asia, such as China, will be brother countries to ours. The enemy, France, will be afraid of us; she will listen to us, ask us for protection. Our flag will fly over the city of Paris, and our colors will brighten the entire globe. At that time the only fear we shall have is that we won't have enough time to protect other countries. All the shame and humiliation we have suffered previously, which resulted from being protected by others, will have become potent medicine to help us built up this feat of modernization. Commemorative monuments will be erected; a thousand torches will illuminate the entire world. The wind of freedom will blow fiercely, refreshing in one single sweep the entire five continents. Such will be the victory of our race. How pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
2. No Obnoxious Mandarins<br>
<br>
The poison of absolutism coming from those people who have oppressed others for thousands of years spread from China into our country so thoroughly that a single individual surrounded by a few thousand mediocre men was able to treat our people like fish and meat. And yet our people are so naive and stupid that they do not know how to wrest back their democratic rights, how to preserve their country's destiny. Day and night, they simply think of how best to provide the ruler and his cohorts with their own blood for beverage and their own flesh for food. Alas! How pitiful that is!<br>
<br>
After modernization the people's mind will be open, their energy increased, their sense of rights developed. Our country's destiny will be in the hands of our people. In the middle of our capital city we shall build a large Congress Hall. All political matters will be decided by the public. The Higher Assembly will wait for the consent of the Middle Congress: the Middle Congress will wait for the consent of the Lower Congress before any decision can be put into action. The Lower Congress is where the majority of the public can debate decisions taken by the Middle and Higher Congresses. Our people, however noble or humble, however rich or poor, however old or young, will have the right to vote. Whether to preserve or to do away with the monarchy, whether to promote or demote the mandarins: our people will have the ultimate right to make those decisions. The mismanagement done by the ruler or the abuses perpetrated by the mandarins, all behavior that is not in conformity with the public good, can be reprimanded or punished by our people in their deliberations in Congress. At that time those mandarins, of however high or low ranks, who are obnoxious to the people, will no longer have the right to live on our land. At that time our people will experience only joy and happiness. They will have their mouth full while pleasantly stroking their belly. When they lift their head, they can see the sky. The mountains will echo a <b>(p.109)</b> thousand peals of laughter. Applause will strike like thunders, singing the praises of the government for a thousand years to come. We shall be that glorious and prosperous! How pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
3. No Dissatisfied Citizens<br>
<br>
The French stole our country. They gagged our mouths. They tied up our limbs. They blinded our eyes. They plugged our ears. The publication of books and newspapers, the deliberations, the meetings no matter whether during daytime or night, no matter how many or how few participants, no matter whether young or old people, the French strictly forbade them all. We still have to obey their order, even when, in anger, they demanded that we look at our fathers as our enemies. When it pleases. them to require us to respect a dog as a king, we still have to acquiesce to their request. Even the king and the mandarins, the rich and the talented people, would not dare go one step away from their houses without asking for special permission from the French. If your taxes are not paid in full to the French, you are regarded as burglars in your own homes. Here are French dogs, French horses, French women, servants of the French: all are free to insult whomever they choose to insult. Seeing them next to our people, it is like paradise on their side and hell on ours. Such iniquity, such inequality, where in the world can one find a more unjust situation? Are we going to sit back and relax instead of rising up to ring the bell of freedom? One who never loses never wins either; we should be determined to break this vicious circle of oppression.<br>
<br>
After modernization we shall wield power in our country. We shall keep our own way of life. Civilization will reign through liberty everywhere. Newspapers will appear on sidewalks, and new books abound. Petitions and lawsuits, verbal and written polemics, will flourish. Domestic and foreign affairs will be discussed in every detail. Writers will be encouraged to create. Every hidden feeling of the rickshaw puller or of the horse attendant. of the mother-widow or of the lone orphan, will reach the leaders' ears. Then the people of our country will be drunk with happiness, a happiness as immense as the ocean, the limits of which the eyes cannot fathom, or as high as the sky the contours of which the arms are unable to grasp. Such freedom, how pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
4. No Soldiers Without Glory<br>
<br>
Before modernization our people had barbarian customs that were deeply rooted, while their desire for progress remained very shallow. They venerated empty pictographs like gods and saints while despising practical professions like grass or thrash. From king to subjects, all looked down upon military officers as servile creatures to be trampled on; they considered soldiers as draft <b>(p.109)</b> buffaloes or horses: just a bunch of wiggling creatures. Our people, being not highly educated, could not see not see very far. When the villagers saw the contempt expressed by those in higher positions for the soldiers, they filled themselves with disdain. They knew that soldiers, while living, always walked in front of their horses, and therefore they were being killed on the front line. And after their deaths they simply became wandering spirits along the roadside, leaving their corpses in deserted plains. Being a soldier is definitely very hard and also very lowly. In addition to all that, the soldiers also received all the mistreatment. The villagers quickly realized how pitiful the soldiers' fate was. And also how discouraging all those diverse feelings were. Under these conditions who would still want to become a soldier? And if no one wants to become a soldier, then who will protect our homes? After our country is lost, who then will be to blame? The country's destiny is, indeed, in the hands of the soldiers. The soldier is our country. If the soldier is so abused, how is the country to be preserved? Now that the country has been lost, it is as if a car in front of us had overturned. Let's look at it as a warning. We should keep in mind that the right and duties of the soldiers are intimately tied to the destiny of the country. We should try to strengthen our country. That is the soldiers' responsibility. That responsibility is also ours. The soldiers should see how their fate will be in the future.<br>
<br>
After modernization military officers, king, and people--all are united. The soldiers will protect the country. They will be respected. All our compatriots will know then that the country belongs to each one of us. Every one of us has the responsibility to protect our country; every one of us has the duty to become a soldier; every one of us will be willing to respect the soldiers. While living, the soldiers will constitute our national militia; they will show their pride for the whole wide world to see. After their death they form the national soul; their spirits will survive with our mountains and rivers. The people in the country will not spare their wealth to honor their soldiers. The king of our country will walk up the ritual platform to offer sacrifices in honor of our soldiers. In Japan there is a monument in Tokyo called the Yasukuni Jinja wherein sacrifices are offered to soldiers killed in battle. Twice a year the emperor comes to offer sacrifices at that monument.<br>
<br>
After modernization we shall follow that example. The nation as well as the society have the duty to take care of the families of the soldiers killed in battle. The nation should build statues in bronze, erect stone stelae to commemorate the soldiers killed in battle. Soldiers! O soldiers! No one in the country can lay claims to the same glory as yours. The honor you earn will not be surpassed. At that time our compatriots will see how vast our country is and how glorious it is to take honor in the obligation of running ahead of the horses. When they look back at their villages, they would pity themselves, for they will <b>(p.110)</b> realize how boring it is simply to die in their own homes. What a joy that will be! How pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
5. No Unequal Taxes or Forced Labor<br>
<br>
Under the previous dynasties that reigned over our country, taxes the rulers levied from the people were not heavy, although their collection could not avoid the following barbarous abuses: (1) the corruption of the mandarins; (2) the greed of the powerful gentry; and (3) the mismanagement of the village notables. There were hundreds of ways to oppress the people, who, consequently, suffered a great deal. But that treatment was still somewhat humane. Today the French consider us no better than animals, buffaloes or horses to be traded in exchange. May I ask a question of our fathers, uncles, brothers, and nephews? The French levy every year from our people a head tax of two, three four, or five piasters. Compared to the price put on a buffalo, a horse, or a chicken, what would be the difference? Alas! Our people have used up their sweat and blood to provide the Frenchmen, their women, their horses, and their dogs each year with so many hundreds, thousands, millions, billions . . .  And yet taxes are levied on everything: on things essential to our survival, on places necessary to our production. Even our bodies, which are created by Heaven and Earth and raised up by our parents with so much pain and care, they also have to be taxed by the French enemy four or five piasters every year. What is the meaning of that? Alas, our bodies are worth less than a buffalo, a horse, or a chicken. How pitiful that is! How pitiful that is! Mistreated in that fashion by the French, how come we have not risen up yet? Taxes, head taxes--that is a form of taxes no other country in the world has, except our own country. Our people are not made of wood, stone, mud, or ashes: how can we accept being despised to that extent? An animal that is cornered knows how to attack and to bite in order to escape; we are human beings, and yet we do not know how to get out of our quandaries. Even a caterpillar knows how to wish that the pine needle would become longer and longer what then about us? When shall we be able to be proud of ourselves?<br>
<br>
After modernization, first, we have to get rid of all the wretched old practices that have existed through many dynasties. Second, we shall reform all the inhumane institutions set up by the French. Taxes, corvées, head taxes--none of these will remain after independence. All taxes will be decided upon  by Congress. Taxes on this or that commodity have to be agreed upon by our people, and the proceeds must be spent on useful enterprises for the public good. The government can only start implementing its tax policies after the  people have given their consent. Our people will not pay one piaster or one grain of rice, if it is not our of their own will and with enthusiasm. Their <b>(112)</b> patriotism leads them to pay their taxes willingly. No more of the barbarous coercive tactics of yesteryear. Then we shall be as happy as the sky is high and the ocean deep. The day will be warm, the wind harmonious, everybody at peace. How pleasant that will be.<br>
<br>
6. No Unjust Law<br>
 <br>
In the old days our penal codes involved cangues and cuffs. Our bodies were oppressed; we could not move around; our bodies were numbed. We could not speak; our mouth would simply shut tight. The culprit, while sleeping or eating, is no different from cows, buffaloes, chickens, or pigs. Alas! Are our compatriots not all our relatives? Are they not made of the same bones and the same flesh? How can we treat them in such a wretched manner because they have committed some crimes? After we have built up our country together, how do we have the heart to treat one another like that? O my compatriots! O my compatriots! Please take a look at our penal code after modernization. <br>
<br>
After modernization, within our country, no one will lack patriotism; all will serve the common good, loving one another, obeying the laws of the country, pursuing the benefits of civilization. Under such conditions what do we need the cruelties of a penal code for? If by misfortune, however, some of us happen to commit some crime, then we shall have a few civilized articles in the penal code to deal with such cases. Our civilized penal code will take its inspiration from those of Japan and Europe. At the capital city we shall establish a Reeducation Center, presided over by a judge appointed by the Supreme National University. The people who have committed crimes will be sent to a school that will bring out and nurture the good side of their heart. That would give them back their civic dignity. We should also set up a workshop to teach them some craft with which they will be able to earn a living. That will prevent them from committing crimes again out of joblessness. We shall also place in that school a fair supervisor, a competent teacher who every day would come to explain to the prisoners the good and the bad so that they can repent for their errors. After their terms of confinement they will be regarded as innocent people; all their civic rights will be restored to them; they will be equal to other citizens. While in jail, the prisoners are like children receiving education. After their sentences have been purged, they will be able to contribute to the affairs of state according to their ability. It is like the spring breeze blowing on everything. All sicknesses and infirmities will be cured. At that time our people will experience only peace and will not know what criminal law means. All sufferings, sicknesses, and infirmities will have been cured with effective medicines. Aggressiveness like that of the tiger, the panther, the peacock, and the owl will all fade away as if melted by sacred water. We shall live in such happiness. How pleasant that will be.<br>
<br>
7. No Imperfect Educational System<br>
<br>
Education is the mold that shapes human beings. Mandarins, officers, and soldiers all come out of it. Education is also the basis on which politics are built. Taxes, criminal law, everything is determined by education. We won’t have anything to say about our premodernization system of education, which is so old-fashioned and conservative. It is as if one broke one’s arm nine times before one finds a way to prevent it from happening again. After modernization our education will be perfect. I should not say more. But since some of us are still in the dark about this problem, allow me to address myself to it.<br>
<br>
After modernization both the royal court and the society will devote all their efforts to education, moral as well as physical. We shall learn from Japan, China, Europe; we shall learn everything. Day care centers, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, universities, will be created everywhere, from the cities to the countryside. Right after modernization we shall invite teachers from Japan, Europe, and America. After a while some of the teachers will still be foreigners, but some of them will be recruited from among our own people. Then, after complete modernization, our own people will know more than the people from Europe or America, so that we won’t have to invite any foreigner anymore. How to establish schools, how to organize the curricula, how to teach, how to find jobs for our graduates- everything will be copied from the good model of Japan and Europe. We shall study philosophy, literature, history, politics, economics, military science, geometry. We shall study industry, commerce, agriculture, home economics, medicine, forestry. For all the disciplines we need to study, we shall employ enough professors. We shall open up enough schools so that our people, whether they be rich or poor, noble or humble, male or female, as soon as they reach five years of age, can receive a kindergarten education in kindergartens; as soon as they reach eight years of age, they can receive a primary education in primary schools; as soon as they reach fourteen years, they can receive a secondary education in secondary schools. When they reach the age of eighteen, their knowledge is already vast enough for them to be admitted into superior schools in order to receive a specialized higher education. All the expenses related to education will be supported by the court or society. If a citizen is too poor to contribute anything toward his schooling fees, then the court and society should come to his aid, so that no citizen shall be denied at least a primary education. Furthermore, before entering primary schools, everyone should already know <i>quoc ngu</i>,[4] be able to read newspapers, and learn about interesting news or about useful commentaries. Their minds will therefore be open more widely. After entering primary school, students should diligently study so as to build up the dignity of a citizen. Moreover, textbooks used in primary and secondary schools, as well as in universities, shall be prepared by the Ministry of Education, which will add <b>(p.114)</b> all the comments and remarks resulting from discussions in Congress. All the textbooks will aim at encouraging patriotism in the people, cultivating their mutual trust and love, opening up their minds, promoting democratic rights so that everyone can advance a thousand steps a day.<br>
<br>
With regard to education, that of the military and women IS the most important. The soldier has indeed the duty to help the peasant, the trader; to open up new land so as to facilitate immigration; to strengthen the position of the country and improve its power. If his education is not thorough, how then IS a soldier to die for the country, for the love of his compatriots, for the prosperity of the fatherland? Once our country has been modernized, the soldiers will receive an education at home while at home, m their garrisons while they are in garrisons. The soldiers who belong to the artillery, cavalry, or logistical corps will be initiated into the methods of artillery, cavalry, and logistics. The sailors, the infantrymen, and their officers will receive an education geared to their branch of service. There will be no place, no moment, where and when education is not dispensed to the soldiers to train them not to fear death, to increase the courage of the commanding officers, so that our country will be the most powerful of the five continents. That is the result of the education of the soldiers.<br>
<br>
Women will become good mothers, loving wives, knowledgeable in literature and poetry, well trained in commerce; they also are expert educators of our children and efficient assistants to our soldiers. A good mother will have nice children; she will be a virtuous wife to a perfect husband. Moreover, in politics women will possess many rights. Only with education will_ one know how to neglect one’s private interests in order to take care of the public good, so as to make one’s country accumulate its riches and increase its strength. A country that has no patriotic women is bound to be subjugated by another country. In the modernization scheme of countries women’s education plays an important role. Textbooks to be used by women must be selected from among the best. The schools that are reserved for women should have better teachers. In all matters related to finance, in industrial schools, in convalescence homes, in trading outlets, in banks, in post offices, in buses, in trains, it is best to employ well-educated women. They will strive to serve the country as much as men. Their pride and dignity will be equal to men’s. The government and society will join in their praises. Every woman in the country should of course endeavor to become a good mother, a virtuous wife, but also a talented woman. They will leave their names in stone stelae and in bronze statues. Women shall not be inferior to men. That’s the aim of women’s education.<br>
<br>
In political institutions justice and humanity will prevail over all other notions. People of the country will be like members of the same family.<br>
<br>
Our national territory extends in the south to the province of Hatien and in the north to that of Langson. That’s our common home. We are born and raised <b>(p.115)</b> in that home, protected by Heaven and Earth. We are compatriots, standing on the same land, and after our death, buried under the same mound. We are of the same blood transmitted by our ancestors through thousands of years. We have the same name, no matter who does the calling. We are unlike the people of Hu, Han, Qin, Yueh.[5] How can anybody say that we do not belong to the same family? In our sufferings, in our affections, we share the same relationship of flesh and blood. We help one another without ever getting angry at one another. Everything looks much like the fresh ocean and the calm spring.<br>
<br>
After the modernization of our country no one should be jobless. We should create charity houses, reeducation institutes, so as to reform those who have committed crimes and, therefore, have to be confined. Schools should be open to teach the blind, the mute, the deaf, the infirm. Orphanages should be established as well as resthouses for the aged and also maternity wards. Schools for the poor should be staffed by experienced teachers, who will treat their pupils with devotion and humanity so that our people may enjoy peace and happiness. Then, nothing will be missing in our system of education. It is as if trees and grass will grow with rain; fish and prawns will dance in a peaceful ocean. If that’s so, how pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
8. No Unexploited Mineral Resources<br>
<br>
Our national territory extends in the west to Siam; in the north to the province of Yunnan; in the east to the China Sea; in the south to the island of Poulo Condore. In the middle, next to the province of Nghe An, there are four marches: Tran Ninh, Tran Dinh, Tran Bien, and Tran Tinh. The northern part of our country includes ten <i>châu</i>.[6] The province of Quang Tri has two Cam regions: Cam Lo and Cam Linh. The south touches two countries: Water Haven and Fire Haven.[7] Our soil is fertile: we can raise cattle in our forests. The flanks of our mountains can be cultivated. Our country has several plains fit for agriculture for a long time. And yet our country is still a semicivilized, semibarbarian one, because the mind of our people is not fully open yet. Our men of talent are few. We rely on human labor and not on machines. The yield of our field is still very low. When a flood or a draught occurs, we simply endure them as unavoidable natural calamities. Our people are unable to save even one, let alone one hundred, kilograms of paddy, and yet thousands of acres of land remain unexploited. Although the monarchy is all-powerful, it does not know how to develop the economy. Our country counts many entrepreneurs, who, unfortunately, do not know how to nurture their talents. The country becomes poorer and poorer. The people encounter more and more hardships. How pitiful that is!<br>
<br>
After modernization agriculture will be developed. It will prosper. If human labor does not suffice, there will be machines to help. If rain and sun are <b>(p.116)</b> not propitious, technology will remedy the situation. If one man does not dispose of enough resources to exploit a plot of land, society will contribute money to complete the work. If the people cannot finish a job, the court will dispatch mandarins to help. The high officials of the Ministry of Agriculture will be people experienced in agricultural sciences. The peasants will receive all necessary information from all quarters. Rice will abound; riches will pile up sky-high. We shall neglect no resources from the forests. In our villages money will be plentiful. Then, more and more land will be opened up for people to settle in. Our strength will be greater than all the neighboring countries combined. We shall be rich. Our fame will spread to the entire world. If we shall be that rich, how pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
9. No Neglected Industry<br>
<br>
Compared to those of other countries in Asia, our people are probably more intelligent and more capable. And yet all the merchandises, all the goods, are imported from foreign countries. Foreigners rake in all the profits. Food such as tobacco, tea, alcohol; textiles such as brocade, velvet, cotton, silk, if they are not made in France, then they are sold by the Chinese; if they do not come from France, then they come from China. We are so stupid to spend all our money on these foreign imports. We feed the resources given to us by Heaven and Earth to the foreigners. Today we buy French merchandise; tomorrow we purchase Chinese goods. This man uses French material; that one wears Chinese clothes. Our people are intelligent and clever. Our country has silver and gold mines, factories, manufacturies. Why, then, are we so stupid as to waste our resources and to subject ourselves to hard work, day and night? That’s simply because the court does not know how to encourage the workers and promote the professions and because our society has no will to fight for its own good. While the French accumulate all the profits, they consider us stupid, incapable. Everyday they try to relegate us into obscurantism in the hope that we will become oblivious of everything.<br>
<br>
After modernization our people will open up their eyes and ears. Their intelligence will expand. Technical schools will mushroom everywhere in the country. There will be engineers to prospect for mines, to smelt gold, to manufacture arms, to invent machines, to produce trading goods, to forge agricultural implements. Our draftsmen will be accurate, our tailors experienced. For every trade we shall have experts. Our technical schools will employ good teachers from Europe and Japan. Little by little, our mineral prospections will spread wider and wider; the profits derived from mineral exploitations higher and higher. The more resources we get out of our soil, the stronger will our country be. Our mountains and rivers will look like satin and brocade; our countryside will appear like big cities. Then, our people will <b>(p.117)</b> acquire so much cleverness that nobody can surpass them. They will know everything pertaining to profession. Even Europe and America will not equal us. How pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
10. No Losing Commercial Activities<br>
<br>
If the merchants are stronger than the tiger and the crocodile, then there is no country in the world they cannot swallow. If the traders hold in their hands rifles or swords, then there are no people in the world they cannot kill. How pitiful are the weak countries! Our country has been weak; its commerce has stagnated. So far, our resources have acted like oil and grease: they have simply melted away, without any hope of recuperation. The poor people would have been enterprising had they possessed the resources. On the other hand, those who dispose of enough means lack determination. Without resources or determination, how can one survive in this competitive world? In the final analysis, if the situation is that bad, it is because our people do not have mutual trust, mutual sympathy. They also lack the desire for progress and the sense of adventure. Without trust and sympathy the poor who have the mental abilities refuse to cooperate with the rich, while the rich who possess the means are unwilling to help the poor. It results in the destruction of our society, the decrease in our resources. Without trying to find ways to unite their efforts or combine their riches, how can they expect to do business? Without the desire for progress or the sense of adventure, they won’t be able to invest a penny, Jet alone millions. They don’t dare take one step away from their homes, Jet alone go across the ocean. The string tight on their purse, their money buried, devoid of any sense of adventure, lacking important investments, how do they expect to run sound businesses?<br>
<br>
After modernization our people’s mind will be wide open. They will learn more about business. Our people will have sympathy for one another; they will trust one another, gathering the resources of thousands and millions of individuals into a common fund, putting the know-how of thousands and millions of individuals into a common pool of knowledge, thereby developing a common enterprise. Our people will venture into faraway lands. The court will respect anyone who has a true profession; society will revere those who are experienced in business. Trade will be developed. Our people will cooperate with one another, combining their resources so as to compete with the foreigners in commercial ventures. Rice, tea, timber, and many other products will be exported to other countries. Our merchandise will top the list in the world. Commercial companies in the capital cities of France: Paris; Germany: Berlin; Great Britain: London; and America: Washington, as well as those at various port cities will agree that our trade constitutes the most prosperous. More than a thousand ships will enter or leave our ports every day. Millions in foreign <b>(p.118)</b> currencies will be added to our treasury every day. At that time we shall use our riches as citadels that no enemy artillery in the world could penetrate. We shall line up our ships as shields so that threats from countries of Europe and America will be just like passing ocean waves. Our country will be that rich and strong. How pleasant that will be!<br>
<br>
If the cultivator knows how pleasant it will be to harvest his crop, then he will not mind the hardships of rains and winds that he must go through at this time. If the builder knows that reunion means joy, then he will not find it annoying to carry stones to build roads. It is the same with the modernization of our country. How pleasant that will be! Who among our people will not agree with it? Who would not applaud it? But after the initial excitement people begin to doubt. For they have no clear ideas about the ways and means to build up a New Vietnam or about the investments necessary to foster a New Vietnam. I, Boi Chau, although my knowledge is limited, am nevertheless a beloved son of our country; I would respectfully like to present my humble perception of it so that our notables, colleagues, and friends can make their choice.<br>
<br>
The Six Desirable Situations<br>
<br>
There are six highly desirable situations: 1. Our people should desire progress and adventure. 2. Our people should love and trust one another. 3. Our people should be concerned about the civilizing process. 4. Our people should have true patriotism. 5. Our people should be truly virtuous. 6. Our people should endeavor to acquire fame and profit.<br>
<br>
1. Desire for Progress and Adventure<br>
<br>
Our people do not lack finesse in their thinking, intelligence in their mind, and heroism in their behavior. Then, how come that, within our country, the one who proclaims himself king can abuse our people at will while he is the servant of a foreign country? From the Chinese Han, Tang, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties to the French today, the skill of being slave has rather been well fine-tuned by our people. Why is that so? Because none of us has the desire for progress, the longing for adventure; because all of us bask in our stupidity and our weakness, finding that the best way to deal with the world is to indulge ourselves in good food and in sex plays. Our garden and our kitchen represent for us the wide universe. Other people can defecate on our head; still we stand there idle and console ourselves by saying, “I only want my peace.” Foreigners may swallow our race and yet we meekly say, “I shall wait for my time.” Alas, in this <b>(p.119)</b> competitive world, where people’s dispositions are as poisonous as snakes, where vultures pursue sparrows, the otter swimming after the fish, where can we find someone like the Buddha? If you don’t want to progress, people will kill you. Who will care about you if you do not have the sense of adventure?<br>
<br>
Even under these circumstances, is our country really incapable of rising up? Please, my dear compatriots, open your eyes in order to wash out the shame inflicted onto our mountains and rivers. All other people behave like heroes; why are we so cowardly and weak-hearted? Other people are all in commanding positions; why are we satisfied with being merely slaves? If all of us have one mind, then we can reach independence. If our desire for progress is firm, our longing for adventure strong, then we shall be able to capture lions and tigers with our bare hands, to catch whales and sharks in the vast ocean. If the strength of one man is not sufficient, then we shall have the strength often men. If the strength of ten men is still not enough, then we shall have the strength of one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand men so as to accomplish the task. If everybody in the country is brave to that extent, then the French will not know a single day of peace. This is the first pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
2. Love and Trust<br>
<br>
Our population is not small; our territory not tiny; our resources not limited, as I have stated above. According to the head tax registers established by the French, our country counts twenty-five million taxpayers; the whole population, therefore, should amount to no less than fifty millions. That is not a negligible number. The area of our territory covers up to 250,000 English square miles. Five kinds of gold, five kinds of rice, are found here, and the soil is fertile. The rice of Saigon,[8] the goods of northern Vietnam, are sufficient to overfeed the Chinese, Indians, Malays, Siamese, French men, women, their dogs, and their horses. The servants and the cooks of the French masters indulge in wasting food and the rest. That serves as evidence to the vast amount of our resources. An important population, a vast territory, with plenty of resources, what can we not accomplish with all that? Why, then are our people still slaves, our resources shrinking away, our business always resulting in bankruptcy, our agriculture in losses, our crafts in shoddy trinkets?<br>
<br>
It is true that Heaven has not been kind to us. That is because our people have no mutual love or trust. They treat one another as people from Qin and Yueh. Although of the same race, they regard one another as enemies. Walls and hedges are erected between houses, moats and ponds dug out in front of every door. A piaster9 given to a brother is as heavy as five kilograms. Close friends are yet separated by a thousand miles, carrying in their mind contradictory thoughts. In time of sickness no help is ever available. People sing in my <b>(p.120)</b> house without any regards whatsoever for you, who are crying in yours. The people in the eastern hamlet, eat and drink to satiety without any worries for the people in the western hamlet who are hungry and thirsty. Alas! After our mountains and rivers have been reduced to ashes, only our combined strength can save them. How do we have the heart to pursue our individual reputation, our private interests, enjoying our own virtue, our own dispositions. Our life is suspended by a single thread; how do we dare lift our arms to fight one agam.st another? Catastrophe is threatening three generations of ours; why do we still fight among ourselves behind the fences, with so much hatred and rivalry? Alas! No strength can subsist without unity, no achievement without cooperation. For a game, a banquet, one needs at least a few dozen people. For an undertaking that will bring profit to ten thousand generations, which will leave its mark on the mountains and rivers, how can a handful people hope to complete the task? So now, what about getting all of us together, combining our intelligence, pooling our resources, renouncing all rivalry and hatred among ourselves, uniting ourselves in life as in death, throwing the riches of tens of thousands of people into a common fund, capitalizing on the strength of tens of thousands of people to build up a common force. You wear my shirt, while I eat your rice. When you fall sick, I’ll bring you the medicine. If my house is dark, I light it up with your lamp. If thousands of people were to join their shoulders, what weight can they not carry? If thousands of people were to lend a hand, what task can they not accomplish? When the people of our country have reached such a mutual trust and mutual affection, will our eyes still see any French gentleman around? That’s the second pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
3. The Civilizing Process<br>
<br>
Soon our people will see automobiles and electric trains. They will hear French rifles and firecrackers. They will know all about French culture and French technology. But right now they are still like blind, deaf, and a bit drunk or benumbed. Why is that so? That’s because we refuse to change. How our ancestors did it, we now do it exactly in the same way. We do not want to devise new methods. Disciplines like optics, chemistry, physics, are said to be too difficult to learn and impossible to imitate. The older people with experience are disappearing every day; the younger ones have family obligations with wives and children. Things related to automobiles and electric trains remain entirely in the hands of the French. What importance does it have that we serve the French as dogs and horses? Let the French make French rifles, French firecrackers. What importance does it have that, as their servants, we slave for the French? We do not have the same culture as the French. Our doctoral and master’s degree holders do not have the same scientific knowledge as the <b>(p.121)</b> French. They are merely good enough to become interpreters in the offices of the governor-general or clerks in their residencies. Their knowledge being so limited, how would they understand anything about civilization? But expertly manufactured products do not spring out spontaneously from the earth. Without education how will one be able to achieve any feat of civilization? Other people have machines; we should try to learn how to make them. People have modernized their ways; why do we have to cling to the old ones? The professional training as practiced in England, Japan, Germany, and America takes at least two years to complete. We should not see it as too difficult. The military, agricultural, technical, and commercial training require at least five years; we should not consider it too long. In order to learn from other countries, we should first familiarize ourselves with their languages, their writing systems, for one or two years. If one has determination, that should not be too hard. And this is simply to get on the bandwagon of civilization. To follow in other countries’ footsteps one should visit all their cities, be confronted with the high cost of living, spend a great deal of money. But if one has determination, one would not consider it too expensive. That is simply to build up the defense of civilization. If other people have taken one month to reach their goal, we should try to attain it in one or two weeks. If other people have the talent to make steps a thousand miles long, we should try to make steps often thousand miles. At first we learn from them. After that they will learn from us. The Japan of today is similar to the Vietnam of tomorrow. That is the third pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
4. True Patriotism<br>
<br>
If the waves are rough, then the coast must be steep. If the rain is heavy, then the sky must be shaken by lightning and thunder. That should wake everyone up who has a soul. Our people have talked at leisure of patriotism, sounding like bells. But talking without doing is like no talking at all. To have knowledge without applying it is like being without knowledge. Our mountains and rivers, for fifty years now, have been moaning and groaning. Now they are like dead and drunk. As long as our bodies can still move, we should try to increase our will and energy. We should try to follow our time. In order to survive our compatriots will need to do two things. They are (1) to shed their blood so as to wipe out the horde of disloyal slaves; and (2) to shed their sweat in order to acquire a good future and to contribute their money so as to accomplish the great task.<br>
<br>
I have always been ashamed of myself because I have not been able to accomplish anything significant. But you, my compatriots, why would you be unable to achieve something? With ten Xie Cheng, a hundred Jing Ke, there is no enmity that cannot be revenged. With one Zi Feng, two Lu Su, there are no <b>(p.122)</b> mountains that cannot be propped up or even moved.[10] That is the fourth pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
5. True Virtue<br>
<br>
In the marketplaces, in the villages, everywhere people talk about civic virtues; even women and children know how to discourse about them. May I ask our compatriots: nowadays, who among us would not be able to accomplish a great deed? In the final analysis one should not talk about the lance in the East as opposed to the shield in the West, or of the pearls of Qin as against the emerald of Qao. One should ponder over the fact that, if the bow from Qu is lost, then someone from Qu would have found it; nothing therefore is privately and individually owned. From one man to the whole population of the country, if everyone is of one will, what can we not accomplish? O my dear compatriots. If you have realized how important the civic virtues are, then try to act accordingly. If someone makes a mistake, his brother will bear the consequences. If someone has talents, his brother should benefit from them. Even lives can be exchanged, let alone money, belongings, resources. Everything should be held in common. The country is common to all of us who should reckon that fact. Everyone should care about the country; everyone should try to help. If you fall sick, I should worry about you as if we shared the same body. Why should we hesitate because we walk in the same direction, on the same road, toward the same goal ahead? After unity has been achieved among the whole population of our country against a small community of Frenchmen, will they still dare sit on our heads and ride on our backs? That is the fifth pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
6. Fame and Profit<br>
<br>
When one talks about moral virtue, one should not think of fame. When one talks about heroism, one should not mention profit. Indeed, fame and profit have no common measure with moral virtue and heroism. Without reality, fame will quickly disappear. And if it is not genuine, fame will look like defamation for thousands of generations to come. If one pursues only one’s own profit, in the volatile conditions of the world today, one will ultimately face a limitless catastrophe. On the other hand, if one has real fame, nobody will dare utter a word against it. People like Washington and Saigo Takamori do indeed have real fame; that is why the capital city of America now holds high the example of the former and the capital city of Japan erected a tall bronze statue in memory of the latter. The search for fame of these two men has certainly been well rewarded. Let our compatriots seek fame in these fashions. If profit is genuine, then not only one can accumulate that profit for oneself, but <b>(p.123)</b> the rest of the people may have an equal share of it. It is like the opening of Africa or the digging of the Suez Canal. These two endeavors require the spending of vast amounts of money. Both aim at profit. But to spend money during more than ten years and subsequently be able to open up an entire immense continent for people to settle or to spend more than a thousand million and end up by reaping profit from the Eastern seas to the Western ocean, the search for profit in such a fashion is also well rewarded. Let our compatriots seek profit in the same way. But of the fame of one day and the one lasting for ten thousand generations, which fame is better? In life one must accept every hardship, including death. In wealth one spends thousands of ounces of gold in order to reach fame and reap profit. In the same manner the rights of the country should be fought for with bones and blood; we should utilize all available resources in order to seize the benefits of civilization. If our people are all determined to seek fame and profit, how then could our country not become rich and strong? That is the sixth pleasant situation resulting from modernization.<br>
<br>
Only when the six desirable situations are realized shall we attain the ten pleasant conditions. After we have realized the six desirable situations, power will reside in our hands. We shall mold it in whatever shape we like. Our country will be rich and strong only when its people have one will, one determination. Then we shall be able to shake the sky and move the earth. Will our people hesitate to accomplish that feat of gathering the energy of all to build up an impregnable citadel and of uniting the intelligence of thousands of individuals to flatten the waves of the ocean?<br>
<br>
Allow me to bow my head in wishing long life to the New Vietnam. 11<br>

Notes<br>

I. SLOT III, 55.<br>
<br>
2. This is how the prosecutor general, chief of the Judiciary Service in Indochina, expressed his opinion about this document, which was naturally banned by the colonial authorities. In a note sent to the governor-general of Indochina dated 28 April 1909, he wrote: “The document <i>The New Vietnam</i> contains trashy statements, defamatory remarks toward France as well as calls for massacre. It deals with laws and regulations to be enacted by the future government of independent Vietnam. The author assumes that the goal of independence has been attained and, from now on, one should plan the economic reconstruction, the political proportional representation, the responsibility of the ruler, the penal regime. Nothing has been left out of that draft of a new constitution and the chapter which spells out the promises for the future is one of the most elaborate in this document. Unjust taxes and the burdensome and tyrannical bureaucracy of the French are considered past realities! One should take good notice of this book for Phan Boi Chau and his devotees are all convinced of the success of their criminal project. Nevertheless, while reading the <i>New Vietnam</i>, one cannot fail to be <b>(p.124)</b> impressed by the ardent faith that moves its author” (ANSOM, Indochine, Nouveaux fonds 28 [2]).<br>
<br>
Phan Boi Chau wrote in his autobiography (Apr. or May 1907) while in Hong Kong: “At this point having a few decades of free time, I wrote <i>Tan Viet Nam</i> (The New Vietnam). This book could be broadly divided into two parts: the first part deals with the ten deep satisfactions (<i>Thap dai khoai</i>) and the second with the ten earnest aspirations (<i>thap dai nguyen</i>). The book was printed in a thousand copies” (in G. Boudarel, <i>Mémoires</i>, 83).<br>
<br>

DOCUMENT2<br>
<br>
<b>(p.125)</b><br>
<br>
Phan Chau Trinh (1872-1926)<br>
<br>
Letter to Governor-General Paul Beau<br>
<br>
(1907)<br>
<br>
Phan Chau Trinh orPhan Chu Trinh was one of the two prominent nationalist leaders in the first quarter of the twentieth century. The other one was Phan Boi Chau. Phan Chu Trinh passed the doctoral examination in the old Confucian educational system in 1901, when he was thirty years old. In 1906 he resigned from his position as an official in the Vietnamese royal administration and, together with Phan Boi Chau, went to Japan to seek help for the Dong Du movement. There the two men discovered that they basically disagreed on two counts. First of all, Phan Chu Trinh did not believe Japan could lend assistance to the Vietnamese independence movement without being tempted to dominate it once the French had vacated the colony. Second, unlike Phan Boi Chau, Phan Chu Trinh intended firmly to put an end to French colonialism at the same time as he would also terminate the monarchical regime in a new independent Vietnam.[1]<br>
<br>
Upon his return from abroad Phan Chu Trinh wrote the following letter addressed to the governor-general of Indochina. In 1907 he helped found a private institution of learning called the Dong Kinh Nghia Thuc (Tonkin Free School).[2] In 1908 he was implicated in a peasant uprising protesting against high taxes. The Vietnamese royal administration condemned him to death, a sentence that was subsequently commuted to forced labor for life to be purged in the infamous penitentiary located on the Con Son island, better known as Paulo Condore, off the coast of south Vietnam. Three years later, in 1911, the French League for Human Rights obtained his freedom in exchange for a voluntary exile in France.<br>
<br>
During World War I Phan Chu Trinh was arrested by the French government and confined for a short while in the Sante Jail in Paris. He was finally permitted to leave France to return to Vietnam in 1925. He died in Saigon on 24 March 1926.<br>

A note written by a French Security agent whose mission was to spy on him and Nguyen Ai Quae reports that he and Nguyen Ai Quae were the “two <b>(p.126)</b> most influential members of the Vietnamese community in France.” Here is how the editorialist of the Co Yo San, a publication of the Vietnamese communists, evaluated him at the time of his death: “he has never been a revolutionary. He never dared to conceive of an armed conflict against the imperialists. He did not know that in order to liberate Indochina, blood must be shed. “3<br>

In this open letter Phan Chu Trinh describes in frank and candid terms the shortcomings of the French colonial policy as it was implemented in Vietnam. As Phan Chu Trinh sees it, the imperfection derives from three causes: (1) “The first one resides in the fact that the Protecting Power gave too great a liberty to the Vietnamese mandarins.” (2) “The second cause resides in the fact that the Protectorate has always regarded with contempt the people of Vietnam, resulting in a segregation syndrome.” (3) “The third cause stems from the advantage that the Vietnamese mandarins take of the segregation policy so as to maltreat their own people.” This document gives Phan Chu Trinh the deserved reputation of being less concerned about French colonialism than about the abuses of the Vietnamese mandarins.<br>
<br>
I, Phan Chu Trinh, former mandarin, am writing to you to describe the critical situation of the Vietnamese country.<br>
<br>
Since Vietnam was placed under their protection, the French have built roads and bridges; they have improved communication through the construction of railroads and steamships; they have established post offices and telegraph lines: all these works are indeed very useful to Vietnam, and anybody with ears and eyes can hear and see them. There are, however, a few features I cannot fail to mention to you: they are the abuses perpetrated by the mandarinate, the sufferings accumulated by the people, and the decay of our customs. The French have not only shut their eyes to all these evils that are undermining the future of our nation; they have, furthermore, allowed these evils to spread their evil influence without even bothering to make an inquiry into their destructive effects.<br>
<br>
In recent decades the high officials of the Royal Court were content to relax in their comfortable palaces, devoting their time to contemplating the futilities of the past. In doing so, they thought they had properly fulfilled their duty. As for the mandarins of the provincial administration, they ruled with arrogance over our villages while sharpening their talent in flatteries toward their superiors. Their ploy has become a daily occurrence. The dignity of the scholars has all but vanished. Their exactions increase with every passing day, so that the masses have no escape. Because of all this, public affairs have been neglected, and the rural population has started to move out of the countryside. The customs are in decay; ritual and propriety have all but disappeared. Thus, a country that expands to more than 400,000 square kilometers and that counts more than twenty million inhabitants is regressing from semicivilization into <b>(p.127)</b> complete barbarism. Maybe educated persons are not lacking who, in the deepest of their hearts, feel distressed over the ruin of their fatherland; to witness the disappearance of their race indeed fills them with anxiety. Everyone realizes the urgency of a solution. Among them those who are more courageous leave for overseas, and, once far away, they weep profusely and never think of a return. The less courageous people bury themselves in the comers of their villages and remain silent. No one dares appear before the Great Dignitary of the Protecting Power [the French governor-general] to denounce, with guts and blood, the inequities committed by the mandarinate and to speak up loudly about the people’s sufferings over the past several decades. Nothing has reached the ears of the Great Dignitary of the Protecting Power so that today Vietnam has become a dying country, without hope for any cure. This is obviously the fault of the educated people, but that state of affairs also derives from the misunderstanding of the masses, who are convinced that the policy of the Protecting Power consisted mainly in mistreating the Vietnamese people.<br>
<br>
It has been several years now since I resigned from the mandarinate. I have traveled extensively throughout the country, from north to south. My ears have been made attentive to what people say, and I have seen with my own eyes the abuses perpetrated by the mandarins. On the other hand, I have made a detailed inquiry into the feelings and opinions that Vietnamese and Frenchmen entertained toward one another. Today, without fear, I have come to describe the situation to you, Great Dignitary of the Protecting Power, in the hope that, upon hearing my testimony, you would sympathize with the situation I describe and not disapprove of my behavior.<br>
<br>
Except for those who are in the mandarinate, in Vietnam today the opinion of the common people, whether they be intelligent or stupid, is that the Protecting Power mistreats the Vietnamese, that it does not consider them to be human beings. When the people observe that the indigenous mandarins, instead of acting in the interest of their own folk, are harming them instead, the Vietnamese would again say that it is precisely the Protecting Power that unleashes these mandarins upon them so that the Vietnamese would destroy one another in such a way that they would quickly exterminate their race. For the Vietnamese people that represents the designs of colonialism. Over the last few years the thinking of our scholars and the songs of our villagers all proclaim the same theme, from north to south. And since they realized that their own intelligence will not be enough to allow them to survive and their strength insufficient to preserve their autonomy, our people look up to I do not know what foreign power to save them.<br>
<br>
Alas, how pitiful is a population of so many millions who count among them so many thousands of educated men and yet are so blind and so weak, so confused and so lost, as not to know how to help one another, to unite with one <b>(p.128)</b> another, to live with one another, and to shoulder one another’s efforts. In this world where might is right they only have complaints without any plan; they live as in drunkenness or in dreams. Isn’t such a mentality profoundly pathetic?<br>
<br>
In the past decades, of all the people in this country, whether intelligent or stupid, rich or poor, no one escapes from the tutelage of the Protecting Power, yet how is it that they all have reached the lowest level of their subsistence, that they are about to witness the destruction of their race? What are the causes of this predicament? I urge you, Great Dignitary of the Protecting Power, to scrutinize them thoroughly so as to understand them fully.<br>
<br>
The causes are three in number. The first one, as I see it, resides in the fact that the Protecting Power gave too great a liberty to the Vietnamese mandarins. Up to now the Protecting Power has been satisfied with placing in the protected country two or three of its great officials, who, together with the Vietnamese royal government, governed the state. The provincial government, on the other hand, had only a few officers of the Protecting Power within its ranks; it obviously cannot function without the service of indigenous administrators to manage the affairs of state and control the people in the countryside. Whether the country is governed or not; whether the people are pacified or not, it all depends on the quality of these indigenous administrators. It makes a great difference whether these mandarins are capable men or incompetent ones, whether they have talents or are devoid of all faculties.<br>
<br>
In the past forty years the decay of Vietnam has been evident. The higher as well as the lower classes are only interested in pleasure. The laws are not respected. Men of talents no longer exist. The high officials simply wait for time to be promoted to higher ranks. The lower-ranked mandarins resort to intrigues and briberies to obtain their advancement. The scholar-students follow their example and have made that kind of behavior into a habit. Those who desire a mandarinal title spend their time begging in front of the higher officials’ residences. Those mandarins who live in the countryside take advantage of their official position and behave with unforgiveable arrogance in their villages. Others, beside their festivities and sexual adventures, hardly know anything else. The peasants, the artisans, the merchants, indulge as well in pleasure. Anywhere one turns one witnesses the same scenes. In cities, as in the countryside, those who have power behave as treacherously as the hare, while the weaklings act as stupidly as the pigs. Ignorant and greedy, they don’t back off from any wrongdoing. Being victims of exactions and beatings, they do not dare show their anger. The entire country is intimidated into cowardice. Human dignity becomes an empty word. Those conditions can be seen clearly everywhere. I am not exaggerating, nor do I dare tell lies about the entire people of the whole country.<br>
<br>
When the people of a country have reached such a low level of decadence, no matter whether they be mandarins, scholars, or commoners, only a clear <b>(p.129)</b> definition of punishments can turn them away from crimes and induce them to live within the law. Only then can they be led onto the path of progress, with the hope that they might be able to help themselves find peace and improvement. The Protecting Authorities have been established here long enough for them not to be aware of that state of affairs. They also know that the customs of Vietnam could not be changed suddenly, and, since the Vietnamese were not capable of governing themselves, the Protecting Authorities have taken into their own hands the administration of the country in the name of the Vietnamese. But, ironically enough, they preserved the Vietnamese royal government; they kept the Vietnamese mandarinate intact while giving them only enough power to transmit orders and levy taxes. As for the affairs of state and interests of the people, the Protecting Authorities never bothered to know anything more. They simply proclaimed that they governed Vietnam with the assistance of the Vietnamese. Naturally, from time to time, they promoted one or two high dignitaries, dismissed one or two mandarins. But if the ones who got dismissed were incapable, the new recruits were not necessarily more competent. If the dismissed officials were rudely greedy, the new appointees have not necessarily kept themselves clean of corruption. Moreover, some who are dismissed one day can find themselves promoted the next day. Removed from this region, they are sent to another. Bad reputation and corrupt practices have accumulated. How pitiful all this is!<br>
<br>
Knowing, for some time, that the Protecting Power favors and never punishes them, the Vietnamese mandarins grow accustomed to that treatment. Those who are greedy become more so, counting on their corruption to climb up the hierarchical ladder. Those who are lazy become even lazier, counting only on their apathy to remain in their position. What they are principally interested in is to show ostentatiously their gowns and their hats; they ride noisily in their carriages or on their horses. When asked about their mandarinal titles, they readily reply that they are the great dignitaries of the Vietnamese government or the high mandarins of the provincial administration. Besides their regular meetings and their routine court appearances, if asked about the strong and weak points of their country or of their province, they would not have a single idea. If one asked the same questions of the prefecture or district mandarins, they would say that they are indeed the chief executives of this prefecture or of that district, but, besides the collection of taxes or the reception of higher officials on visits, they would know nothing concerning the affairs of their constituencies. All officials, whether of high or low rank, considered corruption and exaction the outright privileges of the mandarinate. They paid no attention whatsoever to the people’s complaints. Alas, if it had been true that the Vietnamese people are so corrupt and their mind so shut up and if they had lived in similar conditions for the past several centuries, then their race would have been annihilated long ago. How was Vietnam able to stand as an independent <b>(p.130)</b> country for more than a thousand years, and how was it able to become an important nation in the Southeast Asian region? How could its people develop into an important race today? If France treated all the protectorates and colonies she has in the five continents in like manner, how would any of them accept with grace to follow her guidance? Alas, although Vietnamese law is known to be unjust, some articles would nonetheless exist to rein in the mandarinate. But the most stringent rules are now applied to oppress the common people, while the regulations are so lax toward the mandarins. It is as if the dyke had been broken and water has flooded the four comers of the land; no end seems in sight. All this evil results from the great liberty that the Protectorate has given the indigenous mandarinate, thus allowing it to become so rotten.<br>
<br>
The second cause resides in the fact that the Protectorate has always regarded with contempt the people of Vietnam, resulting in a segregation syndrome. Great France and Vietnam have lived together for a long while now. Seeing that our mandarins are corrupt, our people unintelligent, our customs in decay, the French despise our people, who, in their judgment, have no national dignity. Therefore, in their newspapers, books, conversations, or discussions, they usually express the contemptuous opinion that the Vietnamese are barbarians and comparatively not much different from pigs. Not only do the French refuse to treat the Vietnamese as equals; they even are afraid that if the Vietnamese come too close to them, they might somehow be soiled. Over the last decades, whenever the French officials are angry, Vietnamese mandarins, scholars, or common people, whether they have committed any crime or not, are all humiliated. As for the poor people who sell their labor or the villagers who discharge simply of their corvée duty, many have died, having been kicked and beaten by the French. People from north to south relay that message to one another, and all those who still have some feelings are outraged by the thought that the French are treating us like animals, looking at us like wood and stone. Anger fills their heart, but they dare not speak up. The ignorant people in the villages fear the French like gods from Heaven; they are terrified by the French as they would be by lightning and thunder, running away from them as far as they can. Those scholars who have any conscience left consider a career in the mandarinate as an unenviable outcome. Only those who crave for mandarinal titles or those who are compelled by familial conditions would suffer that humiliation; they subsequently try to forget it, hoping that circumstances and conditions will change. Sometimes on clear nights, they attempt to awaken their consciences, uttering to themselves a few words of shame and anger. Quickly, however, they convince themselves that they are powerless, simply involved in some vicious cycle. Little by little, they grow accustomed to the situation and soon enough reach their peace of mind. It is, therefore, not true that all of them have lost their conscience or that all rejoice in their shame.<br>
<br>
Up to the present day no Vietnamese official, whether of high or low rank, <b>(p.131)</b> would not be terrified, all his hair standing on ends, whenever he meets a French administrator, lest his words or deeds should displease and anger the Frenchman. As for the simple folk in the villages, whether they be mandarins or belong to the scholar-gentry class, whenever they venture a few steps beyond their gates, if they chance upon a French official, a French soldier, or a French merchant, they all bow their heads, drop their ears, hasten their pace to proceed quickly through the encounter. They merely want to avoid being humiliated or beaten up. It is amazing that people of two countries living together on the same territory could have such diametrically opposed behaviors and feelings. It is, therefore, not surprising that only those who desire to become mandarins would sit day after day at the doorsteps of the Protectorate High Officials’ residences. As for the scholars who still possess some sense of dignity, none would dare approach your courtyard. Those who bring their suit to court for one reason or another could hope to see the face of the [French] administrator; at any rate, the complaints and grievances of the common people never reach his ears.<br>
<br>
Alas, it is undeniable that corruption and shamelessness charges can be lodged against the Vietnamese. But in a country this big, among a population of so many millions, are there not one or two persons with whom you could reasonably discuss the advantages and disadvantages to the country? Why, then, does the Protectorate maltreat all the people without exception? I am afraid that the longer the two people live together, the further they will move apart from each other. Given this sort of feeling toward one another, to hope for any kind of solidarity between them is difficult to imagine.<br>
<br>
Recently I read in the <i>Dai Viet Tan Bao</i> newspaper that there are presently about twenty Vietnamese living in Japan. Among those twenty there certainly are one or two who would be somewhat aware of the hopelessness of the situation of Vietnam. These people used to live no further than a hundred miles from you or from the provincial chief. And yet they, who for thousands of years have never gone beyond their gates, have resolved to abandon their families and relatives to cross vast oceans to go to a foreign country that for thousands of years they had never heard of. There they lament with moving voices about all the grievances that trouble their soul. They have resolved not to come to your office or to the provincial chief’s office to give vent to their sufferings. That kind of situation results directly from the policy of segregation practiced by the Protectorate, which consists in treating the Vietnamese people with contempt.<br>
<br>
The third cause stems from the advantage that the Vietnamese mandarins take of the segregation policy so as to maltreat their own people. The isolation of the Protectorate from the people, the divergence of views with regard to the advantages and disadvantages to the country and the corruption of the mandarinate, have already been discussed earlier. Nevertheless, were it not for that <b>(p.132)</b> segregation policy, maybe one day, because the French will have lived long enough to understand the situation or maybe because the Vietnamese people will no longer be able to contain their sufferings and will try to disclose their grievances, then East and West might be one; the two sides might understand each other, and the mandarinate would have no room to show its wickedness. I am afraid that such an idea is so seductive that the mandarinate would want to suppress it, and that is why its officials endeavor to sow the seeds of segregation. They also know that what the administrators of the Protectorate like or care for is the collection of all the taxes and the impression of all the corvée labors; what they dislike are obstacles put in the way of the implementation of official business and conspiratorial assemblies. Therefore, what the Protectorate officials like or care for the mandarins put it in their heart and their feet, eager to satisfy them, even if they have to skin the people alive, suck their blood, or carve out their bones. Nothing will stop them. When the mandarinate are sent out to administer a province, a prefecture, a district, they use their position to threaten the people; they exercise their power to oppress the scholars. Then, fearing the possible reaction of the people and the scholars, the mandarins quickly implicate them in activities they know the Protectorate dislikes: if the mandarins do not accuse them of taking advantage of their wealth to prevent the administrators from doing their duties, then they accuse them of rallying the scholar-gentry for illegal purposes. All these denunciations are, of course, false and groundless, but, being unaware, the Protectorate believes them. That is why some people are falsely accused and are even indicted. Sometimes the Protectorate recognizes the groundlessness of the accusations, but still it would not punish the mandarins, under the pretext that they were but doing their administrative duties. It all results in the people being further alienated from the administration, the scholars’ morale sinking to a lower level, and the mandarins’ power becoming more consolidated.<br>
<br>
The prefecture and district mandarins simply choose the domain in which they want to exercise their corruption. When it comes to lawsuits concerning robberies or homicides, the mandarins can always use some pretext to extort bribes; this, naturally, ends in hundreds of abuses. With regard to the number of schools (in any given province), the culture of silkworms (those who desire to raise them are given the breeding larvae for free), the cultivation of rice (the cultivators who harvest the best rice are allowed to auction them), to the annual registration of manpower and rice fields, the general census of population, the inspection tours of the Protectorate officials, the smallpox vaccination tours by medical doctors, the transportation of merchandise- none of these matters, in the eyes of the Protectorate officials, should be a burden to the common people. To the Vietnamese mandarins, however, they are important social activities or urgent businesses to be pressed upon them. So they scatter to the four comers to sow untold misery among the people and to put forth exacting demands on <b>(p.133)</b> them. The money collected from welcoming or farewell parties, from the legalization of official deeds or contracts, from the fines imposed by the notables of the village and other officials of the administration, pile up as high as mountains. For the past several decades, when the grievances of the people have reached the ears of the mandarins, they are considered gratifying opportunities to make money. Whether it pertains to important or trivial matters, whether it is urgent or not, as soon as the mandarins receive a piece of paper from the Protectorate officials, it is as if they had laid their hands on a precious pearl. They would treasure it as a protective talisman, happy that it would make them into prosperous mandarins. As for the small clerks, the cantonal notables, all oppressors of the people, seeing this, they all become so highly envious that they carry gold and silver to the capital city or to the provincial cities in order to buy a low-rank mandarinal title in the hope that even a bit of left over would be enough to make themselves and their families prosperous. Such are the sufferings of the poor people that can be seen only in their general outlines. Under so many layers of power and authority nobody, understandably enough, dare speak up. A few scholars, being aware of this kind of situation but feeling that they belong on the outside and fearing that they would be held in suspicion, are unwilling to be concerned with the problem. The grand mandarins, although conscious of it, prefer to let that situation slip by as if they had not heard of anything, because of their own corrupt practices. As for the officials of the Protectorate, perhaps because of a lack of communication or because of their isolation from reality, they do not know anything.<br>
<br>
Today the people are ruined; poor as rich are suffering; many are lying dead from starvation in the streets; robberies and banditry crop up everywhere; reproach and grievances are heard all over: the situation has indeed reached some degree of urgency. The scholars in the country advocate the study of the West, the abolition of the mandarinal examinations, and the foundation of trading corporations; all that, if successful, will relieve the situation maybe by one or two percentage points only. Even so, the mandarins still view these activities as directed against them. If they do not consider them as unsound enterprises, they see them as conspiracies. These false and segregationist accusations must have reached your ears not once every day but many times over. Alas, even if Vietnam is a barbarian or semicivilized country, it has, for thousands of years, transmitted its writing from generation to generation. Its poetry and its books are still extant. Is it not a well-known fact that to serve the people deserves praise and to mistreat them constitutes a crime? How can the mandarins, who are familiar with books and writings, see their offices as marketplaces, the common folk as fish and meat, those who are concerned about the well-being of the people as mad persons, those who think about the people’s interest as rebels, so that nowadays black is no longer distinguishable from white, right is confused with wrong. They act evil, and they speak evil. <b>(p.134)</b> Nothing is sacred to them anymore. This stems from the fact that the mandarins exploit the distance separating the French from the Vietnamese people to alienate them completely from each other.<br>
<br>
Of the three wrongs mentioned here I have presented only one or two examples. As for the clever flattery of the mandarins and their strange cruelty, even the most imaginative scholar of Europe in his hundred cogitations would not be able to understand them. How the common people suffer from cold and starvation, how they endure their hardships, the most talented painter of Europe in his hundreds of sketches would not be able to reproduce them. If the situation is so desperate, it is simply because the Protectorate favors the mandarinate, maltreats the people, and lets the mandarins abuse the people. That’s all.<br>
<br>
The policy of the Protectorate in its management of the affairs of Vietnam lends itself to some comments. These comments concern the Protectorate’s refusal to teach the people efficient ways to earn their living, to familiarize them with new methods to make profit, while taxes have all been increased and corvée required from the people in a hundred different schemes-so much so that now, out of ten poor people, five or six reach the stage of misery through the corruption of the mandarins, three or four through corvée and taxes. For thousands of years Vietnam was an agricultural country; people also raised cattle and silkworms. Specializations did not prevail yet, and industry and commerce were still lacking; that state of affairs does not invite any remark. Recently, however, people from every walk of life, high and low, every one, are only in search of pleasure, interested merely in finding their own peace. The court is incapable of renovating anything, while the people happily indulge in their laziness. Money stagnates, the ways leading toward profit are without issue; that is why among hundreds of taxes none is sufficient. Whenever a bad crop occurs, the peasant relies on charity. The ignorant people, not knowing what to do, sit noisily around, waiting for food to come: they thus sit unto death. Today people start to migrate from their land and scatter into the four corners of the country. Governmental efficiency breaks down; the people’s customs deteriorate: this indeed has not resulted from only one day’s evolution.<br>
<br>
From the time Vietnam became a protectorate of France, bridges, sewers, and roads have been built and repaired; military posts and stations have been erected; salaries and indemnities for the mandarins have accumulated into the millions. And yet, beside the taxes, principally those imposed on land and per head, and not counting the customs duties, the government does not know where to go in order to improve its finances. Given the present situation, there is indeed no other way out. But if the government had secured the collaboration of two or three high mandarins with some technical knowledge and some human feelings and the assistance of a few hundred officials with talent and honesty, if it had treated them with sincerity, delegated some power to them, <b>(p.135)</b> the government would have been able to discuss with them ways and means to raise profits and decrease expenses, to change this or modify that, to plan improvements in economic fields, to devise new methods for earning a good living, and after all that and only then, slowly, it could increase the taxes. In this way benefit would accrue to the state, and no harm would befall the people. It is, therefore, not true to assert that there is no way out.<br>
<br>
But now, claiming that the mandarins are incompetent and the village people deceitful, the Protectorate applies its own policy. No matter whether the lands are large or small, with good or bad soil, the manpower is big or small in number, rich or poor, they are equally taxed. This year taxes have been increased by l percent; next year it will be another I percent. This year an item is added to the tax assets, next year another one. That is the Protectorate’s financial policy, which is enforced with utmost energy. The mandarins, seeing it as a way toward promotion, suck all the blood of the people in order to reach the quota. All of them see in that fiscal policy the easiest way to get as much money as possible. It is only to be feared that, once the fish is caught and the pond empty, the policy cannot be applied over a very long period. The Finance Department of the Protectorate knows its mathematics well. I don’t question its figures. For any given province all it has to do is to calculate the surface of its fields, its other resources, the number of its inhabitants, the cost for their food and clothing, their other expenses, the amount of taxes paid . . . It would immediately see whether the resources of that province were abundant or scarce, whether the standard of living of its people was high or low; everything would be so clear. To all the expenditures one should add the bribes paid to the corrupt mandarins, the energy spent in forced labor, the resources lost through natural calamities-all this is in fact difficult if not impossible to compute. Finally, one should also take into consideration the alms donated to the homeless, the wealth lost to burglars and bandits. In these conditions is it realistic to wish that people would not die of hardships?<br>
<br>
What to say now of the abuses pertaining to forced labor. Every able body, each year, has to give fourteen days of forced labor: four days for public works and ten days of corvée. In addition to these fourteen days the people have to pay for every other public work done by the state in the interest of their community. All this, in fact, does not represent too great a burden. But it does elicit, in the villages, a great deal of disturbance: some people leave; others return; there is a constant movement on the road to and fro; not a single day is peaceful. In addition, the mandarins take advantage of the situation to exercise their arbitrariness: they set this villager free from his obligations but draft the other; they replace this name by another name; they take everything into their own hands, consulting no one else. It should be the mandarins who put out the money to hire the people, but it turns out to be the people who put out the money to hire the mandarins. How many poor people came out of this quandary <b>(p.136)</b> losing their jobs or ruining themselves completely? As for the money the government should receive for their hired labor or from other transactions, the clerks in public offices retain most of it. The poor people, all year round, run from place to place offering their labor, carrying their products, and yet only one- or two-tenths of the wages due them reach their pockets. In these miserable circumstances it is difficult to ask the people not to leave everything and become vagabonds.<br>
<br>
The fate of the Vietnamese people today is indeed miserable and insecure, indeed not different from that of buffaloes and horses. People can tie them up, whip them at will. They have a mouth but dare not speak. They are about to die without being allowed a lament. Weighing down on them is the power of the Protectorate government compounded by the cruelty of the Vietnamese mandarinate. What can one not get out of them through whipping? I am afraid that soon the rich people will be ruined, the poor ones resourceless; the mild people will become beggars and the tough ones robbers and bandits. A few more years from now villages will be deserted, old and young people will have died, if not of hunger, then of imprisonment or exile; if not from drifting along the highways, then from the oppression of the mandarins. The day will come when rice fields will have no one to tend them; corvée will no longer be honored; taxes no longer paid. Even if you peel their skin or carve their bones, the only good that it will do is to send the Vietnamese people onto the same path as the Red Indians of America. That’s all.<br>
<br>
Alas, the French emperor Napoleon as an envoy from Heaven spread around him the flowers of freedom, so that until today the European people have not ceased singing his praises. As for the saying “consider your enemy as friend,” it is a principle regularly professed by French women and children. Today, as this old country of many thousand years in Asia has come under the protection of the French flag, it has become so wretched and oppressed that it can no longer stand on its own. I am sure that you must be deeply moved and troubled by that situation and that, day and night, you are pondering a remedy that would not let that misery linger at the expense of French honor and with the unfavorable criticism of other nations. Because of the abuses of the mandarins, because of the burden of taxes and corvée, the sufferings of the people have reached alarming proportions, and yet the Protectorate continues to ignore their supplication: wouldn’t it be now too late?<br>
<br>
Recently, people in the North and South have been entertained by the rumor that the Protectorate is going to change its policy within the government of Vietnam: it will modify its treatment of the Vietnamese people; it will regard the French and Vietnamese in the same way so as to conquer the hearts and minds of the people. I presume all that is to be seen as long-range policy goals. I have read many newspaper articles coming from Hanoi and have learned that the governor-general of Indochina, in speeches delivered in Hanoi, talked of <b>(p.137)</b> improving the treatment of the Vietnamese, of civilizing the Vietnamese. Many matters are mentioned over and over again-things like reform of the penal code, renovation of the educational system. But with regard to the abuses of the mandarinate, the exactions of taxes and corvée, not a single word has been uttered. The French editor of the newspaper <i>Le Courrier d’Haiphong</i> has written thousands of words commenting on the policies implemented in Indochina. He is not at a loss for words when it comes to criticizing the taxes and the corvée systems. But, concerning the Vietnamese mandarinate, his argument is that if this old institution of Vietnam is not preserved, the Vietnamese people cannot be governed. That kind of interpretation is indeed frightful. After all, the Protectorate’s use of the indigenous mandarins to oppress the Vietnamese people is not a new phenomenon. The fact that the mandarinate relies on the authority of the Protectorate to oppress the people provokes the resentment of the people against the Protectorate: that sentiment is quite deep and widespread. Now if one wants to pursue the good while not, at first, eradicating the evil, or, in similar fashion, if one wants to govern the people without first selecting good mandarins, I doubt that one can attain any success. At the present time the Vietnamese people are awaiting their imminent death, while the mandarins do not know anything else besides carrying out orders and running errands. If you force them to apply your new policy, I am sure you don’t want it to be only in words. The mandarins, however, will not cooperate. What they want is to remain silent and abuse the people, that’s all. To paint a mural in five colors on a wall of mud or to garnish with eight most delicious dishes a dusty table is not only a useless act; it is an uncouth masquerade. Can one call that attitude generosity toward the Vietnamese people? Is it what civilization means? It is in fact not different from giving a cake to a child who makes a nuisance of himself or to offer gold and silver to the people lest they revolt because of starvation. Alas! What all that does is to increase the doubt in people’s minds: what is left for them to do is to await death. I cannot see in it any gain to the Protectorate’s civilizing policy toward Vietnam at all.<br>
<br>
When one examines the Protectorate’s policy closely, one has the impression that the Protectorate is afraid that the scholars and people will conspire to resist it. The Protectorate, therefore, uses the mandarins to spy on them; it relies on punishments to oppress them. Encouraging the mandarins to indulge in abuses would simply result in dulling the spirit of the scholars and people. That should, of course, be avoided. To love freedom, to conspire for independence, to be ashamed of being slaves to others, all that can be suspected of peoples of Europe. But to suspect the Vietnamese people of these sentiments is no different from suspecting a weakling of climbing a wall to commit a burglary or a three-year-old child of burning houses to kill people. That’s being oversuspicious.<br>
<br>
In the past years education has not been too well developed in Vietnam; <b>(p.138)</b> the customs have deteriorated, intelligence has decreased, and honesty has all but disappeared. Within the confines of a village or a hamlet people consider one another as fish and meat; those who belong to the same family and share the same blood cannot help but see one another as the enemy. Even if they had any rebellious design, they would not have had any land to retreat to, no arms and ammunition to use, nor any resources to count on. But, if by some weird circumstances, the Protectorate were to lend them a few thousand rifles along with the territory of a few provinces for them to keep as their own without asking any further questions, I am sure that after a few years, if they don’t take revenge on one another, then they will become rivals; if they don’t steal money from one another, then they would fight against one another over rank and position; they would kill one another to the last one. It is certain that they cannot survive one single day in the present world. What to say about rebellion against anyone else?<br>
<br>
The scholars and people of Vietnam are powerless; therefore, there is nothing to worry about as far as they are concerned. But to say that they are of one heart and one aim together with the Protectorate, that they have no suspicion whatsoever, that they trust the Protectorate unto death, that’s certainly not the case either. Over the past several decades the abuses of the mandarins have been more than severe; the resentment accumulated by the poor people runs deep enough. In addition, the tax burden, the natural calamities of drought and flood, the impossibility of acquiring the means of subsistence, the threat of death and perdition, sufferings piling upon sufferings- all this seem to have no end.<br>
<br>
Now the resentment has become momentous; the people’s feelings are at a boiling point; their complaints echo mournfully to faraway places. If they did not stand up to fight against the mandarins, that’s simply because they have not had any opportunities. Should some day a strong neighbor come to sow trouble [in Indochina] and should France and that troublesome neighbor come to fighting against each other, then surely the people will rise up. The greedy will plunder in order to appropriate wealth, the strong will kill to settle old scores, while the mandarins will side with the stronger party. The great order having been shattered, the fastest will then occupy whatever territory they can lay their hands on. If people were allowed to choose their masters and their owners, they would not hesitate to do so. These are the deep feelings of the Vietnamese people today. If you say that it is the duty of the Vietnamese people to fight to their death on behalf of the Protectorate against the invaders, I am afraid that within the borders of this country there are quite a few people who disagree with that assertion of yours. Naturally, if the Vietnamese people have pushed themselves into these quandaries, it is simply because of the hardships they have endured from bad government, because of the oppression they have <b>(p.139)</b> suffered from an unreasonable power, and not because the Vietnamese people have any special predilection for rebellions, calamities, or catastrophes.<br>
<br>
If France is really interested in changing her policy, she should employ only those mandarins who have talent; give them authority and power; treat them with propriety; show them sincerity; deliberate with them over the best means to promote the good and eradicate the evil; open up new ways for the people to earn their living; provide the scholar-students with the freedom of discussion; widen the freedom of the press so as to know the people’s sentiments; put an end to the abuses of the mandarinate by resorting to just punishments and fair rewards. Furthermore, if, little by little, the legal system is improved, the mandarinal examinations abolished, the educational system renovated, libraries built, teachers trained, commercial and industrial knowledge encouraged, the taxes and corvée systems ameliorated, then the people will quietly devote their efforts to do their work well. The scholar-students will discharge their duties with joy. At that time people will only fear that France will abandon Vietnam. Who would and could see her as an enemy?<br>
<br>
Alas, the Vietnamese people are in full decay, their intelligence totally blackened. Compared to other countries of Europe and Asia, the distance is great. The only way for us to keep our territory and to allow our race to survive on this globe is to have a capable teacher to educate us and regard us as his pupils; to find a good mother who would treat us like her own children, raise us and take good care of us, with confidence and with affection. From East to West, from North to South, wherever one goes, everything points to dependence. If there must be dependence, then to talk about the glory of depending on X or the shame of depending on Y, all that is sheer nonsense.<br>
<br>
If out of untold sufferings, by throwing away thousands of those ignorant heads, discarding thousands of liters of dirty and colorless blood; by tossing out a thousand corpses whose blood flies and gnats would not dare suck, whose flesh foxes or raccoons would not dare nibble, the people gain in exchange a slave condition for hundreds of generations to come, do you expect them to be fully satisfied? I don’t think the Vietnamese people are that stupidly mad. If this time I am not more outspoken, it is simply because I would like to see what designs the Protectorate has in the way it intends to treat the Vietnamese people. That’s all.<br>
<br>
It is with a sad and resentful mood, not knowing where to vent my frustrations, that I took up my pen courageously to write to you these frank remarks. I also set aside everything about rite and ritual. If you sincerely have any regard for the Vietnamese people, then you will generously examine my intention, receive with goodwill my suggestions. You will allow me to come to your doorstep. Without haste you will ask me questions. I will then open to you my heart, discuss with you the good and the evil, in the hope that the people of 140)</b> my country will have a chance to come back to life. That is my deepest aspiration. But, on the contrary, if the unique policy of the government of the Protectorate is to mistreat the Vietnamese people; if it has resolved to abandon 460,000 square miles of national territory and sacrifice more than twenty million people; if it is determined not to allow the scholars and people of Vietnam to raise their head in dignity, then accuse me of treason, indict me with slander and libel, put me in handcuffs and shackles, then throw me into a cauldron of boiling oil, so that those scholars within the country who are endowed with some intelligence and talent will have their legs paralyzed and their mouths shut. They will then know how to behave properly, how not to follow in my footsteps, and how not to speak up improperly so as to be implicated in crimes similar to mine. That would be the misfortune of Vietnam, and that also is my warning.<br>
<br>
I await the instructions and orders of Your Excellency the Great Dignitary of the Protecting Power.4<br>

Notes<br>
<br>
1. According to Phan Boi Chau’s biographers, Kiem Dat and Phan Ba Can, in Phan Boi Chau (Sepulveda, Calif., 1981 ), 23, Phan Chu Trinh would have explained the difference between the two of them in the following way: “The entire country is in a deep sleep, their snore sounds like thunder. Far from the outside, you appeal to their patriotism, you scream your lungs out, but to no avail! What you really need is some one in the country who would knock people’s head, twist their ears so as to wake them up! I’ll go back home and play the role of Mazzini while, outside, you will be Garibaldi.”<br>
