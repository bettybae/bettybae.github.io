<h1>X | The Days of August</h1> 
<br><br><b>On August 14, 1945, the guns fell silent across Asia.</b> With the announcement of the Japanese decision to surrender, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur headed for Tokyo Bay to present the Allied peace terms to representatives of the imperial government on board the battleship U.S.S. Missouri.</p><p>In their mountain fortress at Tan Trao, Vietminh leaders had already heard the news of Tokyo's impending surrender and had begun to react. On August r6, the day of the opening of the National People's Congress, 
units of Vo Nguyen Giap's Vietnamese Liberation Army, accompanied 
by Major Allison Thomas and his Deer team, had begun to move southward 
toward the Red River delta. On the same day, popular uprisings 
broke out in rural districts throughout North Vietnam. Some of the 
actions were essentially spontaneous in character; others were incited by 
local Vietminh units. In those areas where government power was successfully 
destroyed, local "people's liberation committees" were established. 
The seals of office were transferred to the new authorities, and 
hostile elements were beaten and in a few cases people were put to death. \ </p><p>The revolutionary forces were undoubtedly assisted by the famine in the northern and central part of the country that had continued since the previous winter. The government of Prime Minister Tran Trong 
Kim, which was appointed by Emperor Bao Dai after the Japanese coup 
in March, had attempted to end the crisis by stopping the forced sale of 
rice to Japanese authorities, placing a ceiling on prices, and seeking to 
increase grain shipments from the southern provinces by improving 
transportation facilities. Famine relief associations were established to 
provide grain to the needy. A good spring harvest had helped to reduce 
the famine, but heavy rains in midsummer caused the Red River and its 
tributaries to overflow. Many peasant families living in the low-lying 
regions of the delta were forced to abandon their homesteads and seek refuge on the dikes above the swirling waters. Widespread hunger provided 
a golden opportunity for the Vietminh, who continued to encourage 
angry peasants in areas coming under their occupation to seize public 
rice stocks for their own use. But at least in the short term, little could 
be done to alleviate the suffering. Up to one million people, nearly 10 
percent of the population of the northern half of the country, had died 
of famine during the first half of the year.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></p><p>In a few instances, the insurgents encountered opposition from Japanese occupation forces. When units of Giap's VLA, carrying U.S. weapons 
and dressed in fatigues, entered the provincial capital of Thai Nguyen 
on the morning of August 19, a massive popular demonstration broke 
out in the center of town to welcome the new arrivals, and dispirited 
soldiers of the Civil Guard turned their weapons over to the attackers. 
The Vietnamese governor and other senior officials within the province 
announced their surrender, but Japanese troops launched a vigorous defense 
of their own headquarters in the center of town. When news of 
the stubborn Japanese resistance reached the Party Central Committee, 
it ordered Giap to leave a portion of his troops in Thai Nguyen to block 
the Japanese, while directing the remainder toward the capital of Hanoi. 
A similar process took place in neighboring Tuyen Quang province.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a><br><br><b>In Hanoi, rumors that Japan was about to surrender had begun to circulate on August 11, after the dropping of the second atomic bomb, on Nagasaki, two days earlier.</b> Members of the Party regional committee 
under Nguyen Khang began rapidly to prepare for an insurrection to 
seize the city from the Japanese. In fact, they had been preparing for 
that day for several months. Although there were only about fifty Party 
members in the capital, several thousand people had reportedly joined the 
Vietminh National Salvation Associations as disillusionment with the ineffectual 
policies of the Tran Trong Kim government spread. By the end of 
I944, the most dedicated activists were being enrolled in assault units 
designed to seize government installations, or in so-called honorary units 
to carry out terrorist operations against government officials and other 
local residents sympathetic to the regime. In the surrounding villages, 
armed propaganda units had been formed to prepare for the moment 
when local villagers would be ordered to enter Hanoi to arouse the urban 
population and assist urban forces to seize power.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> </p><p>Economic conditions in all urban areas operated in favor of the insurgents. Industrial production had plummeted during the last two years 
of the war, while inflation-brought on in part as a result of the issue 
of banknotes by the Japanese military administration to meet its own 
needs-was rising rapidly. In a few months, the rate of exchange for the 
Indochinese piastre declined from about US$0.25 to less than US$0.10. 
By some estimates, the cost of living was up over thirty times what it 
had been at the beginning of the war. With living costs rising and the 
food shortage continuing, many middle-class residents in Hanoiand 
other major cities began to turn their eyes to the Vietminh, and some 
even began to buy Vietminh "revolutionary bonds" to curry favor with 
the potential new revolutionary authorities </p><p>During the first two weeks of August, Party leaders based in Hanoi sought to infiltrate government military units stationed in the capital and established contact with Phan Ke Toai, the imperial delegate in Tonkin. Toai, who was reported to be secretly sympathetic to the revolutionary 
forces (his son was actively involved in the Vietminh Front), 
met with Nguyen Khang on August 13 and asked the Vietminh to join 
the Bao Dai government, which was now prepared to deal with the 
victorious Allies. But Khang refused and advised that the emperor abdicate 
and turn over power to a new republican government. Toai was 
noncommittal, but agreed to transmit the message to the imperial court 
in Hue. On the same day, Prime Minister Tran Trong Kim, conscious 
of the stain of illegitimacy on the current government and painfully 
aware of his own inexperience (prior to appointment as prime minister, 
he was a historian of moder~te political views), resigned in Hue and 
turned over his authority to a committee designed to serve as a provisional 
government until the arrival of Allied forces. Non-Communist 
nationalists created their own Committee for National Salvation to serve 
as the representative of that government in Hanoi.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a></p><p>Reports that Tokyo had accepted Allied peace terms the previous day arrived in Hanoi on August 15. Japanese occupation authorities immediately 
turned over power to the local Vietnamese government. That 
evening, members of the Indochinese Communist Party regional committee 
for Tonkin met in the suburb of Ha Dong to draw up their own 
response to the week's events. Although the committee had received no 
orders from Ho's headquarters in Tan Trao, the Party's March directive 
had emphasized the importance of local initiative in order to take maximum 
advantage of the vacuum that would be created at the moment 
of Japanese surrender. The regional committee ordered popular uprisings 
in the provinces throughout the Red River delta in preparation for an 
imminent attack on the capital. A five-man "Military Insurrection Committee" 
was created under Nguyen Khang to direct the operation. The 
next morning, Khang rode by bicycle into Hanoi, where he met with 
local leaders to coordinate their actions. But, lacking word from Tan Trao, 
they still made no final decision on how and when to seize power.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[5]</a> </p><p>On the night of August 16, the people of Hanoi lay in the dark awaiting their fate. The street lights in the center of the city had been 
dimmed and covered in black shades in preparation for possible air raids, 
and the occasional light emanating from local hotels and restaurants 
contrasted sharply with the prevailing blackness. Suddenly, the eerie 
quiet of the streets was punctuated by the sound of pistol shots. A 
Vietminh squad had entered a downtown movie house near Hoan Kiem 
Lake (known to the French as Le Petit Lac) and interrupted the film 
with a series of short speeches. When a Japanese military officer in the 
audience fled the theater, he was gunned down on the street. His body 
lay untouched for hours. </p><p>Hoping to devise a response to the rapidly evolving situation, leading members of the Tonkin Consultative Assembly, a deliberative body created two decades earlier by the French colonial regime, convened a meeting of the assembly at the imposing Governor-General's Palace in the fashionable northwest section of the city on the seventeenth. The meeting 
was dominated by pro-Japanese members of the Dai Viet party, who had 
formed the majority in the Committee for National Salvation created 
four days earlier. They called for popular demonstrations in support of 
the Bao Dai government. In the meantime, however, Vietminh units in 
the suburbs-responding to the order of the Military Insurrection Committee- 
had gone into action, seizing power from local authorities and 
establishing people's revolutionary committees in their place. Militia 
units, often armed with no more than sticks, sabers, and a handful of 
antiquated firearms, were created among the able-bodied, in preparation 
for an advance into the city the following morning.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a></p><p>The stirring events taking place in the suburbs heightened the level of ferment inside the city. On the afternoon of August 17, while the 
Tonkin Consultative Assembly was still in session in the Governor General's 
Palace, another meeting convened at the Municipal Theater, 
an ornate French-style opera house built at the beginning of the century 
in downtown Hanoi. This meeting had been called to bring together 
political parties and groups loyal to the provisional government just 
created by Tran Trong Kim; a large crowd, estimated at 20,000, gathered 
in the square in front of the theater to observe and perhaps influence 
the proceedings. But as the conference opened, pro-Vietminh demonstrators 
acting under the orders of the Party municipal committee began 
to chant slogans demanding national independence and power to the 
people. Soon, militant agitators entered the building and ascended to 
the second floor, where they ripped down the imperial flag on the balcony 
and raised the red and gold standard of the Vietminh Front. Nguyen 
Khang mounted the rostrum erected in front of the building, announced 
the Japanese surrender, and appealed to the assembled crowd to support 
the forthcoming uprising. The meeting' ended in chaos when the crowd 
formed into a massive column that marched through a heavy summer 
rainstorm to the Palace of the Imperial Delegate, two blocks away. Others 
continued to the Governor-General's Palace or to the old commercial 
section of the city. </p><p>That evening, as the city lay tense in the heat of the hot summer night, the Party's local leaders met at a secret location in the suburbs, to map out plans for the following days. Spurred on by Nguyen Khang, the committee decided to use the next day to smuggle weapons into the city and place the Party's assault teams at strategic locations for an insurrection to be launched on August 19. Party leaders estimated that 
there were now over roo,ooo Vietminh sympathizers in the city, or at 
least half the entire urban population. To bolster their strength, reinforcements 
were to be infiltrated from the suburbs, where militia units 
were awaiting the order to march. In the evening of the eighteenth, the 
members of the Military Insurrection Committee quietly entered Hanoi 
to direct the action. </p><p>A large crowd began to gather in the square before the Municipal Theater in the early morning hours. Many of those in attendance were 
peasants from the neighboring villages of Thanh Thi, Thuan Tin, and 
Phu Xuyen who had been mobilized by Vietminh armed propaganda 
teams and had begun streaming into the city before dawn. Others were 
townspeople, workers, sti:.dents, merchants, and government officials simply 
curious to take part in the coming events. According to one participant, 
the men were dressed in brown shirts and rubber sandals, the 
women in brown blouses and kerchiefs and walking barefoot. The streets 
were a forest of red flags, each sporting the now familiar gold star in the 
middle. Because it was a Sunday, all the stores were shut, as were the 
local food markets. </p><p>A ceremony began in front of the Municipal Theater just before noon. After a moment of silence to commemorate those who had died in the 
struggle for independence, a band played the new national anthem as 
the flag was raised. Then a member of the Party's municipal committee 
appeared on the balcony and announced that the general insurrection was 
under way. Shortly after, the crowd branched out into several columns, 
each proceeding to a strategic point in the city: City Hall, the central 
police headquarters, and the Palace of the Imperial Delegate. Most were 
unopposed, but in a few instances they encountered temporary obstacles. 
When the group led by Nguyen Khang approached the palace, a unit 
of the local Civil Guard was deployed to offer resistance, but after a brief 
skirmish with a Vietminh assault team, the officer in charge surrendered. 
Members of the Vietminh unit scaled the wrought-iron fence in front of 
the palace and their Vietminh flag was soon hoisted in place of the 
imperial banner. Other columns marched to the headquarters of the Civil 
Guard, the city prison, and other municipal buildings, and occupied 
them as well. </p><p>Neither the provisional government nor the Japanese offered any resistance. Mter negotiations with Vietminh leaders, Japanese occupation 
authorities reached an agreement that Japanese troops would not intervene. 
The Committee for National Salvation established a few days earlier 
seemed powerless to act-and in fact, it disintegrated before the end of 
the day. By sundown, Hanoi was in the hands of the revolutionary forces 
in a bloodless takeover, and Vietminh authorities sent messages to units 
elsewhere announcing the victory and giving instructions for further action: 
"If possible act as in Hanoi. But where the Japanese resist, attack 
resolutely. It is necessary at all costs to seize power." </p><p>The events of the past few days had been an exhilarating experience for the population of Hanoi, which had suffered through several years of economic privation and Japanese military occupation. Unrestricted by 
Japanese police, crowds circulated through the streets, waving banners 
and shouting slogans demanding independence and the resignation of 
the puppet imperial government. Few of those wandering through the 
downtown streets had a clear idea of the nature of the Vietminh movement, 
which now claimed to represent the interests of all the Vietnamese 
people. But for the vast majority, the end of the Pacific War and the 
possible eviction of the French provided reason enough to celebrate. <br><br><b>News of the events in the capital spread quickly throughout Tonkin and undoubtedly facilitated the Vietminh takeover elsewhere in the region.</b> Revolutionary forces brushed aside the halfhearted resistance 
offered by local authorities or the Japanese and in countless villages and 
market towns took power virtually unopposed. By August 22, the red 
flag with the gold star was flying throughout Tonkin and the upper 
districts of the panhandle. A cease-fire arranging for the surrender of all 
Japanese troops in the citadel at Thai Nguyen was negotiated the next 
day. </p><p>In the central provinces stretching south along the coast, the situation was somewhat more of a challenge. The revolutionary movement 
was not as well organized in the provinces of Annam, and lacked the 
advantage of a liberated base area within which to obtain recruits and 
provisions. Distance made communications with the Vietminh leadership 
in the north more difficult, and although Party units had received the 
March directive from the Standing Committee, it sometimes took several 
days to receive messages from Tan Trao, or even to obtain reliable news 
about the events taking place in Hanoi. </p><p>Under the circumstances, local Party leaders decided to act on their own initiative. Their main focus of •attention was the imperial capital 
of Hue, where Party operatives had been preparing for the coming insurrection 
since receiving the March directive. The population mix in 
the region, however, was not as favorable to the revolution as it was 
farther to the north. As the old imperial capital, Hue was a city of 
administrators and court officials rather than factory workers or merchants. 
Although some residents-notably students, artisans, and petty 
functionaries-leaned toward the revolution, there were also a number 
of political parties or factions sympathetic to the old regime or even to 
the Japanese. As a consequence, cadres concentrated their efforts in 
neighboring rural villages, where support for the Vietminh was fairly 
strong. </p><p>On August 21, Emperor Bao Dai in Hue received a cable from the new government in Hanoi demanding his abdication. Local Party leaders 
seemed briefly uncertain what to do, but when the young revolutionary 
poet and Vietminh operative To Huu arrived in town, the ICP provincial 
committee became energized. Vietminh activists seized administrative 
power in surrounding villages and began to organize peasant militia 
units. Then, on August 22, more than 10o,ooo people gathered in the 
old imperial capital while the local uprising committee took power. As 
had been the case in Hanoi, there was virtually no resistance from the 
local government or the Japanese. <br><br><b>For the Vietminh, Cochin China was the toughest nut to crack.</b> After 
the suppression of the 1940 uprising, the local ICP apparatus had been 
thrown into disarray. Most of the Party leadership in the region was either 
dead or in prison, and sympathizers were dispirited. In the meantime, nonCommunist 
elements prospered under the Japanese occupation, which encouraged 
the growth of a nationalist movement directed against the West 
that reflected Tokyo's version of the Monroe Doctrine, one based on the 
slogan "Asia for the Asians." The Vichy French administration of Jean Decoux 
attempted to maintain its own influence by cultivating moderate elements 
connected with the relatively affluent middle class in Saigon and 
major market towns in the Mekong delta. </p><p>Faced with the threat of virtual extinction, Party elements painstakingly attempted to reconstruct the movement from scratch. Leading the 
effort was the veteran Stalin School graduate Tran Van Giau, who had 
been in prison at the time of the Cochin China insurrection in I 940 but 
had managed to escape the following summer. In the absence of any 
communication from the Party leadership in the north, local Party operatives 
decided to abide by the spirit of the Sixth Plenum of 1939, 
which had called for preparations for a future general uprising, while 
adapting it to conditions in Cochin China. Lacking a mountainous redoubt 
like the Viet Bac in the North, Giau decided to focus Party efforts 
on the city of Saigon-Cholon, while building up strength in rural areas 
for a general uprising at the end of the Pacific War. Although Party 
activists were unable to dominate their nationalist rivals as was the case 
elsewhere in the country, Giau attempted to boost the spirits of his 
colleagues by citing the example of the Bolshevik revolution to the effect 
that a trained and disciplined minority could seize power in a fluid 
situation. He thereupon began to plan for an urban uprising, with help 
from peasant elements infiltrated into the city from the suburbs.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a></p><p>By early 1945 the Party had created a clandestine labor movement in the Saigon area with cells in more than seventy industrial establishments and a membership of 3000 workers. After the March coup, which 
toppled the Vichy French regime in Indochina, ICP activists took advantage 
of relaxed political restrictions by taking control over a youth 
organization established under Japanese sponsorship called the Vanguard 
Youth. Led by the covert Communist Pham Ngoc Thach (a son of the 
family friend Pham Ngoc Tho, who had sheltered Ho Chi Minh in Qui 
Nhon during his trek south after taking part in the peasant riots of 
1908), the Vanguard Youth served as a cover for Party efforts to mobilize 
patriotic youth for future service in the revolutionary cause. Somewhat 
reminiscent of the Boy Scout movement in the West, with uniforms, 
songs, and an intense sense of mutual identity, it spread rapidly during 
the spring and summer of 1945 in schools, factories, and farm villages; 
by August the Vanguard Youth had a membership of over a million, in 
almost every province in Cochin China.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[8]</a></p><p>After the March coup, the Japanese had decided to retain control over the administration of Cochin China for strategic reasons; only on August 14 did local occupation authorities permit Emperor Bao Dai to appoint the veteran nationalist Nguyen Van Sam as his imperial viceroy for the region. Non-Communist elements created a National United 
Front (Mat tran Quoc gia Thong nhat) to fill the vacuum that would be 
left by the departing Japanese. On August 16, the front’s executive committee 
took power in Saigon in a bloodless coup: while awaiting the 
arrival of the imperial viceroy. </p><p>Faced with the dual danger of the prospective return of the French and the rise to power of a non-Communist Vietnamese administration in Saigon, Tran Van Giau attempted to improvise. On hearing of the 
Japanese surrender on August 14, he met with regional Party leaders to 
set up an uprising committee and prepare for an insurrection. But some 
of the members-undoubtedly recalling the debacle of 1940-expressed 
doubts that revolutionary forces were in a position to seize power. Not 
only did they lack sufficient numbers of weapons to arm the paramilitary 
forces that had been organized among progressive workers and the most 
militant elements in the Vanguard Youth, but Party leaders in Cochin 
China were unaware of the intentions of their colleagues in the north. 
Eventually the committee decided to delay the uprising until news had 
been received about the situation in Hanoi. In the meantime, they would 
launch a "test case" by attempting to seize power in a few select localities 
in the countryside while seeking to build up the base of the Vietminh 
movement among the general population throughout the southern 
provinces.</p><p>When news of the August Revolution in Hanoi reached Saigon, on August 20, Tran Van Giau requested a meeting with the executive committee of the National United Front. At the conference, held two days 
later, he argued that the Front, composed of many parties and groups 
that possessed damaging ties to the Japanese occupation regime, would 
certainly not be. accepted by the Allied powers as the legitimate representative 
of Vietnamese national aspirations. Only the Vietminh Front which, 
he argued, had full Allied support-could do that. During the 
meeting, word arrived that Emperor Bao Dai had called on the revolutionary 
authorities in Hanoi to form a new government to replace the 
defunct Tran Trong Kim administration. Reluctantly, nationalist representatives 
agreed then and there to cooperate with the Vietminh. The 
National United Front was disbanded and replaced by a new Committee 
for the South (Uy ban Nam Bo), with Giau as chairman. </p><p>In the meantime, Giau's "test case" uprising in Tan An, a town a few miles southwest of Saigon in the Mekong delta, had gone off without a hitch or any response from the Japanese. This success enabled Giau to 
persuade doubters on the Party regional committee to give their approval 
for a general insurrection to seize power in Saigon on August 25. That 
operation was to be followed by smaller local uprisings in rural areas. 
Success, he argued, was "ninety-percent certain," but action must be 
taken before the arrival of Allied troops. That night, the plan was finalized, 
and on the morning of the twenty-fifth assault teams seized key 
government installations and enterprises, while thousands of villagers 
who had gathered previously in the suburbs entered the city to mingle 
with townspeople in chanting "Down with the imperialists, down with 
the French colonialists," "Vietnam for the Vietnamese," and "All power 
to the Vietminh." By midmorning, most of the city was in the hands of 
the insurgents. Although revolutionary units were ordered to avoid confrontations 
with Japanese troops, there were a few violent clashes between 
Vietnamese and Europeans on the streets, and there were reports of scattered 
lynchings. Shortly after noon, the Committee for the South, six of 
whose members were from the Vietminh, was sworn in as the provisional 
government of Cochin China. The following day, Vietminh radio trumpeted 
the success of the revolution in "the city of Ho Chi Minh."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> <br><br><b>While the wave of revolutionary fervor swept across the land, Ho Chi Minh was preparing to leave his guerrilla base in Tan Trao and travel to Hanoi.</b> Although he must have shared the common jubilation 
over the stunning events taking place throughout the country, he 
was undoubtedly conscious of the intimidating challenges ahead, and 
quoted Lenin's famous words of warning to his own colleagues: "Seizing 
power is difficult, but keeping it is even harder." On the morning of 
August 22, he left for Thai Nguyen, traveling part of the way on foot 
and the remainder by auto and ferry, arriving there shortly after nightfall. 
The journey had been a difficult one-he was still suffering from the 
aftereffects of his illness, and had to be carried part of the way on a litter. 
The next day, accompanied by a local woman cadre, he continued south 
by automobile on Route 3 into the delta and crossed the Red River still 
swollen by heavy summer rains-into the northern suburbs of Hanoi. 
The sight of the flooding, which had inundated rice paddies and 
villages throughout the area, inspired him to remark in sorrow, "What 
can we do to save the people from misery and famine?" </p><p>On the morning of August 25, Ho was met in the suburban hamlet of Ga by Vo Nguyen Giap and Tran Dang Ninh, who had come from Hanoi to greet him and give him an account of the situation in the capital. Shortly after, Truong Chinh arrived; that afternoon, he and Ho left by car for the city. 
Crossing the river over the Paul Doumer Bridge, 
they passed through streets now festooned with Vietminh flags and banners 
and went directly into the old Chinese section of town, where they 
stopped at a three-story row house on Hang Nhang Street owned by a 
Vietminh sympathizer. It was now used by a number of Party leaders as 
their temporary residence. Accommodations had been arranged for Ho 
Chi Minh on the top floor. It was the first time in his fifty-five years 
that Ho Chi Minh had been in Hanoi.[10]</p><p>That afternoon, Ho Chi Minh convened a meeting of the Party's Standing Committee at his new residence. While the conference was in 
session, the first detachments of the VLA began to arrive from Thai 
Nguyen and, after lengthy negotiations with the Japanese authorities, 
crossed the bridge into the city. The meeting took place on the second 
floor, where his colleagues Giap and Ninh had set up their own sleeping 
arrangements. As described by Vo Nguyen Giap, the room was used as 
both dining and sitting room, and had no desks. Ho worked at the 
dining table, with his familiar typewriter placed on a small square table 
covered with a green cloth in one corner. After the first night, he moved 
down from the third floor and slept on a collapsible canvas bed that was 
folded up during the day, while his roommates reposed on a davenport 
or two benches put together. To the servants and neighbors, Ho and his 
colleagues were simply "gentlemen coming from the village for a visit.[11]</p><p>The main topic at the meeting was the need to announce the formation of a provisional government. The Standing Committee had already 
confirmed that the National Liberation Committee created at Tan 
Trao, of which Ho was the chairman, would serve as a temporary government 
until a formal one could be elected. At the meeting, Ho suggested 
that the provisional government should be broadened to include 
a number of non-Party elements, and that the composition of the new 
government should be presented at a massive rally to announce the declaration 
of national independence. All this, he urged, must be accomplished 
before the arrival of Allied occupation forces.</p><p>It was none too soon, for even as Ho Chi Minh turned his attention to the formation of a new Vietnamese government, the first foreign troops were already beginning to arrive in Hanoi. At the Potsdam Conference, 
held in the suburbs of Berlin at the end of July and early August, 
the Allied powers had agreed to divide French Indochina into two separate 
zones in order to accomplish the surrender of Japanese forces and 
restore law and order in the country. Because U.S. forces were actively 
involved in accepting the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army elsewhere 
in Asia, no U.S. troops were to be involved in the operation here. 
North of the Sixteenth Parallel, the task was assigned to Nationalist 
China; to the south, it would be accomplished by Great Britain. At U.S. 
insistence, the French were not included in• the operation. </p><p>Because the end of the Pacific War had come with such lightning swiftness, the main units of the occupation forces were not expected to arrive in Indochina for several weeks. But an advance party of American 
and French officers had already arrived at Gia Lam Airport and took up 
residence at Hanoi's stylish Metropole Hotel. A luxurious hotel built in 
French colonial style, the Metropole was located directly across from the 
Palace of the Imperial Delegate and a block east of Hoan Kiem Lake. 
Among the new arrivals was Captain Archimedes Patti, the OSS officer 
who had enlisted Ho Chi Minh's cooperation during their meeting at 
Jingxi four months previously. </p><p>Shortly after the Japanese surrender, Patti had been appointed to head a "Mercy" team to fly to Hanoi in order to obtain the release of Allied prisoners of war held in Japanese concentration camps, as well as to provide intelligence information on conditions in Indochina. Jean 
Sainteny, one-time head of the French military mission, and now the 
senior representative of General Charles de Gaulle's Free French government 
in China, had requested permission to join Patti on the trip, allegedly 
to ascertain the situation of the thousands of French residents 
there. Although both the Chinese and the U.S. governments were reluctant 
to authorize the French to play any formal role in the surrender of 
the Japanese, Sainteny was eventually given permission to accompany 
Patti's team to Hanoi, provided that he limit himself to taking part in 
humanitarian operations. </p><p>Once he was ensconced at the Metropole Hotel, Patti opened negotiations with the Japanese occupation authorities. He also established 
contact with local representatives of the victorious Vietminh Front, as 
well as groups representing French residents in the city, many of whom 
were fearful of possible attacks on Europeans. Around noon on August 
26, he suddenly received an invitation to meet with Ho Chi Minh. He 
drove a circuitous route to Ho's residence on Hang Ngang Street. After 
opening pleasantries and a delightful meal of fish soup, braised chicken, 
and pork, followed by rice cakes and fruit, the two engaged in a lengthy 
conversation about the current situation. Ho complained about the presence 
of the French team in Hanoi, which, at Sainteny's instructions, had 
just taken up residence at the Governor-General's Palace-and warned 
Patti that its actual goals went well beyond its stated concern for the 
conditions of French citizens in Indochina. He expressed concern about 
the attitude of the Chinese and the British governments, remarking that 
the latter shared the French interest in retaining the Asian colonies, while 
the Chinese were likely to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese to 
obtain advantages of their own. </p><p>Ho also attempted to probe his visitor about the U.S. perspective on Indochina. 
Conscious of his reputation among politically knowledgeable 
observers as a veteran agent of the Comintern, Ho protested that he was 
only a "progressive-socialist-nationalist" who had turned to Moscow and 
the Chinese Communists because there were no alternatives. But Patti, 
according to his own account, was noncommittal, insisting that he was 
not authorized to engage in discussions of local politics. For Ho Chi 
Minh, there was one piece of good news. Just before Patti left, a messenger 
arrived with a report that Nguyen Van Sam, the imperial viceroy 
of Cochin China, had tendered his resignation to the court in Hue. 
Shortly after three-thirty in the afternoon, Patti took his leave and returned 
to his new residence at the Maison Gautier, a luxurious villa on 
a quiet tree-lined street close to Hoam Kiem Lake. 
</p><p>At the Maison Gautier Patti found• a message from Jean Sainteny, who invited him for a conversation at the palace. 
Sainteny, who was 
undoubtedly aware that the American had been in contact with Ho 
Chi Minh, expressed an interest in holding discussions with the Vietnamese 
leader. Patti agreed to pass on the message; later in the day he 
was informed that Vo Nguyen Giap had agreed to meet with Sainteny 
and Patti the following morning. Clearly the Vietnamese hoped to use 
the American's presence to strengthen their case in this first meeting 
with a French official since the end of the war. Giap arrived at the palace 
in a white linen suit and a battered fedora, and was immediately 
subjected to a lecture from his host on the reckless behavior of the 
Vietminh authorities, which threatened law and order and the lives of 
innocent French citizens. Giap retorted that he had not come to defend 
the actions of the Vietnamese people, but to exchange views with 
a representative of the "new French government." Sainteny then became 
more conciliatory, promising his visitor that the French government 
would respond in a favorable manner to most of the requests of 
the "Annamite" people. But he refused to go into specifics and issued a 
veiled warning that without a French presence, the people of north Vietnam 
would be at the mercy of Chinese occupation forces. The meeting 
ended inconclusively.[12] 
<br><br><b>While Ho Chi Minh was beginning the long and tortuous process of negotiating with France over the postwar fate of the Vietnamese people, his government had also been exchanging messages with the imperial court in Hue over the potential abdication of Bao Dai.</b> 
By 
August 20, the emperor had already hinted at a willingness to step 
down in response to a request from a group of patriots in Hanoi and 
he had formally appealed to the new authorities in Hanoi to form a 
government, but Ho and his colleagues had decided to forestall his action 
by sending a delegation to Hue to demand his abdication in favor 
of a new Vietnamese republic. The delegation, consisting of the veteran 
labor organizer Hoang Quoc Viet, Ho's old comrade Nguyen Luong 
Bang, and the journalist and Party propagandist Tran Huy Lieu, arrived 
in Hue on August 29. After attending a mass meeting before the townspeople 
to explain their intentions, they met with the emperot the next 
day in the imperial palace. The bespectacled intellectual Tran Huy Lieu, 
who had developed a reputation as one of the more militant members 
of the ICP, spoke for the delegation: "In the name of the people, the 
venerable Ho Chi Minh, president of the Liberation Committee, has 
honored us by sending us to Your Majesty to receive your authority." 
Bao Dai, who had never before heard the name Ho Chi Minh but 
suspected that the new president was indeed the veteran revolutionary 
Nguyen Ai Quoc, formally carried out the act of abdication. Then, at 
the delegation's request, he repeated it that afternoon before a hastily 
assembled audience in a brief ceremony on the terrace of the Moon 
Gate, at the entrance to the imperial city, where the flagstaff already 
flew the red banner with the gold star. After receiving the imperial 
seal, Tran Huy Lieu tendered an invitation to Bao Dai from President 
Ho Chi Minh to go to Hanoi to take part in the installation of the new 
government. Bao Dai agreed to attend, as an ordinary citizen of the 
republic. In general, the atmosphere surrounding the change of regime 
was festive rather than frightening, although some observers were visibly 
upset by the sight of the emperor abdicating the throne, even if 
the act appeared to be voluntary. 
</p><p>Not all of Bao Dai's subjects were treated with such elaborate courtesy. 
Two prominent opponents of the ICP, the conservative journalist 
and politician Pham Quynh and the court official Ngo Dinh Khoi, were 
quietly arrested by revolutionary activists in Hue and executed in early 
September. In Quang Ngai province, farther to the south, the veteran 
Trotskyite Ta Thu Thau, long one of the more outspoken critics of the 
ICP from the left, was arrested by Vietminh adherents and met the same 
fate.[13] 
<br><br><b>On August 27, Ho Chi Minh convened a meeting of the National Liberation Committee, soon to become the new provisional government, at the Palace of the Imperial Delegate, now to be renamed the Bac Bo Phu, or Northern Palace. </b> 
 In his now characteristic manner, Ho showed up at the meeting in his jungle 
clothing, with worn brown shorts, rubber sandals, and a khaki sun helmet. The agenda for the meeting 
was to formalize the membership of the new government and discuss 
the wording of the text for the Declaration of Independence. Ho had 
been at work in a dark small room at the ba~k of the house on Hang 
Ngang Street, typing and retyping the draft document. Now he was 
ready to present it to his colleagues. As he told them later, these were 
"the happiest moments" in his life.[14] 
</p><p>At the meeting, Ho suggested that the new government be broadly based to reflect all progressive strata and political elements in the country, and that its policies be aimed at achieving broad unity within the population. 
His proposals were accepted unanimously, and several Vietminh 
members of the committee reportedly offered to resign to make 
room for members of other political parties. After Ho Chi Minh was 
elected chairman of the provisional government of a new Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam (DR V), he extended his welcome to each member 
of the new government, which decided to establish its headquarters at 
the Northern Palace. 
</p><p>Two days later, the names of the members of the new government were announced on the Hanoi radio. 
In addition to the presidency, Ho 
Chi Minh occupied the position of minister of foreign affairs. Vo Nguyen 
Giap, Pham Van Dong, Chu Van Tan, and Tran Huy Lieu occupied the 
ministries of Interior, Finance, National Defense, and Propaganda, respectively. 
Other high officials were from the Democratic Party, a puppet 
party representing progressive intellectuals that had been established under 
the aegis of the Vietminh Front in 1944, and among the appointees 
were a Catholic, and several individuals aligned with no parry. About 
half of the ministries in the n~w administration were assigned to members 
of the Vietminh Front. 
</p><p>During the next few days, Ho Chi Minh worked steadily at a small office in the Northern Palace, polishing his speech declaring national independence that was scheduled to take place on September 2. 
He had moved 
his residence to a more secluded villa on Rue Bonchamps, but continued to 
take his meals with his colleagues at Hang Ngang Street. Party leaders had 
decided that the ceremony would be held in the Place Puginier, a large 
square adjacent to the Governor-General's Palace. The city had returned to 
a semblance of normalcy, although popular demonstrations in support of 
the new government took place almost daily. Hastily produced flags bearing 
the gold star on a red background began to appear on the façades of 
homes and shops, while Vietminh self-defense units assumed sentry duty 
at public offices and buildings. With the war at an end, the black shades 
that had been placed over street lamps had been removed, and the downtown 
area took on a more festive atmosphere after dark. There were still 
relatively few foreigners in the streets, since most of the French who had 
been interned after the March coup had not yet been released from imprisonment 
and the bulk of Chinese troops had not yet arrived. Japanese troops 
generally stayed out of the public eye, although on several occasions a confrontation 
between Japanese and Vietminh military units was averted at 
the last minute through urgent negotiations. 
</p><p>Beginning in the morning hours of September 2, crowds began to gather in Place Puginier, soon to be renamed Ba Dinh Square. 
As described 
many years later by Vo Nguyen Giap: 
Hanoi was bedecked with red bunting. A world of flags, lanterns and 
flowers. Fluttering red flags adorned the roofs, the trees and the lakes. 
Streamers were hung across streets and roads, bearing slogans in 
Vietnamese, French, English, Chinese and Russia: "Viet Nam for 
the Vietnamese," "Down with French colonialism," "Independence 
or death," "Support the provisional government," "Support President 
Ho Chi Minh," "Welcome to the Allied mission," etc. 
Factories and shops, big and small, were closed down. Markets 
were deserted .... The whole city, old and young, men and women, 
took to the streets .... Multicolored streams of people flowed to Ba 
Dinh Square from all directions. 
Workers in white shirts and blue trousers came in ranks, full of 
strength and confidence .... Hundreds of thousands of peasants 
came from the city suburbs. People's militiamen carried quarterstaffs, 
swords or scimitars. Some even carried old-style bronze clubs 
and long-handles [sic] swords taken from the armories of temples. 
Among the women peasants in their festive dresses, some were clad 
in old-fashioned robes, yellow turbans and bright-green sashes .... 
Most lively were the children .... They marched in step with 
the whistle blows of their leaders, singing revolutionary songs.[16] 
</p><p>In the center of the square, a guard of honor stood at attention in the hot summer sun before a high wooden platform erected specially for the occasion. 
It was from this rostrum that the new president would 
introduce himself, present his new government, and read the Declaration 
of Independence. As the time for the ceremony approached, Ho Chi Minh 
uncharacteristically appeared concerned about the clothing he should 
wear, asking a colleague to find him a proper suit to wear for the occasion. 
Eventually someone loaned him a khaki suit with a high-collared , 
jacket, the attire that he would wear along with a pair of white rubber 
sandals. 
</p><p>The program was scheduled to begin at 2:00 P.M., but because of the heavy foot traffic heading for the square, Ho Chi Minh and his cabinet arrived a few minutes late in their American automobiles. Mter 
they mounted the rostrum, Vo Nguyen Giap, the new minister of the 
interior, introduced the president to the crowd. Ho Chi Minh's speeoh 
was short but emotional: 
"All men are created equal. They are endowed by their creator with 
certain unalienable rights; among these are life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of h~ppiness." 
This immortal statement appeared in the Declaration of Independence 
of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader 
sense, it means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, 
all the peoples have a right to live and to be happy and free. 
The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the citizen, made at 
the time of the French Revolution, in 1791, also states: "All men 
are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free 
and have equal rights." 
</p><p>Ho Chi Minh followed those words with a litany of crimes committed by the French colonial regime in Indochina, crimes that had finally driven the people of Vietnam to throw off the yoke of French colonialism and declare their national independence 
He then concluded with a ringing 
affirmation of Vietnam's right to be free: "Viet Nam has the right 
to enjoy freedom and independence and in fact has become a free and 
independent country. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to 
mobilize all their• physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives 
and property in order to safeguard their freedom and independence." 
.</p><p>At one point in his speech, Ho Chi Minh looked out at the crowd and said simply: "My fellow countrymen, have you understood?" 
According 
to Vo Nguyen Giap, a million voices thundered in reply, "Yes!" 
The ceremony concluded with the introduction of the members of the 
new council of ministers, brief remarks by Giap and by Tran Huy Lieu, 
and a public recitation of the oath of independence. Then the dignitaries 
left the podium and the crowd dispersed, some of them excitedly pointing 
out the squadron of U.S. P-38s that passed overhead. Ceremonies 
celebrating the transition to independence also took place at a Buddhist 
temple and the Catholic cathedral. That evening, the new president met 
with representatives from the provinces. 
</p><p>French citizens in the audience had undoubtedly reacted to the day's events with a mood of foreboding. 
There were about fifteen thousand 
French living in Hanoi at war's end, and many had taken the precaution 
of arming themselves in preparation for possible difficult days to come. 
There were nearly five thousand French prisoners being held at the citadel 
in the center of town, and Patti reported that they were making 
advance preparations to take up arms at the moment of landing by Free 
French forces in Indochina.[17] 
<br><br><b>On September 3, dressed in the same faded khaki uniform and pair of blue canvas shoes that he had often worn in the Viet Bac, President Ho Chi Minh convened the first meeting of the new council of ministers in the downstairs conference room at the Northern Palace</b>. 
The 
National People's Congress held at Tan Trao had already approved a 
series of measures-labeled the "ten great policies" -that had been 
drawn up earlier by the Executive Committee of the Vietminh Front. 
Some of them dealt with actions that needed to be taken to strengthen 
the armed forces in preparation for a possible future struggle with the 
French or the Allied occupation troops, others with the creation of a new 
political system and the adoption of measures to improve the national 
economy and to establish relations with other countries within the region 
and around the world. 
</p><p>In his opening remarks, Ho Chi Minh explained that the most urgent topic was the terrible famine-specifically, how to alleviate its effects. 
Although the crisis may have abated somewhat during the early summer 
as the result of a good spring harvest, conditions had grown worse once 
again in August, when the Red River overflowed its banks and flooded 
low-lying rice fields throughout the lower reaches of the delta. Students 
at the local university organized teams to go out each morning to assist 
in removing the dead bodies that had accumulated on the streets of the 
city in the preceding twenty-four hours. At its meeting, the new government 
adopted a series of emergency measures to fight the famine, 
including a campaign to encourage the population to conserve food by 
reducing consumption. To set an example, Ho announced that once every 
ten days he would go without food. The food that was saved was to be 
distributed to the poor. In subsequent weeks, the government approved 
a number of additional policies to conserve rice and increase production. 
Communal lands, which constituted more than 20 percent of all irrigated 
land in the northern and central provinces, were divided up ~ong all 
villagers over eighteen years of age. The manufacture of noodles and the 
distillation of rice alcohol was prohibited, the agricul~ural tax was reduced 
and then suspended entirely, a farm cred.icbureau was opened to 
provide farmers with access to easy credit, ~~d ~acant lands throughout 
the north and center were ordered to be placed under cultivation.[19] 
</p><p>The council also turned its attention to several other issues. 
One of Ho Chi Minh's primary concerns, as expressed in his comments at the 
September 3 meeting, was the low rate of Literacy in Vietnam. According 
to one source, 90 percent of the Vietnamese people were estimated to be 
illiterate in 1945, a damning indictment of French educational policies 
in a society where literacy rates had traditionally been among the highest 
in Asia. A decree was now issued requiring that all Vietnamese learn to 
read and write the national script (quoc ngu) within one year. The decree 
carried a strong Confucian flavor: "Let those who cannot yet read and 
write learn to do it. Let the wife learn from her husband. Let the younger 
brother learn from the elder. Let parents learn from their children. Let 
girls and women study harder." Mass education schools were to be 
opened to provide training for students ranging in age from young children 
to the elderly. Although teachers and school facilities were in short 
supply (in many instances, pagodas, hospitals, and markets were turned _ 
into schools), the program had a significant impact: by the fall of 1946 
over two million Vietnamese had obtained a level of literacy.[20] 
</p><p>At the cabinet meeting, Ho Chi Minh also raised the question of how to prepare for general elections to create a formal government based on democratic liberties. 
On September 8, a decree announced that elections 
for a constituent assembly would be held in two months to draft 
a new constitution for the DRV. All citizens over the age of eighteen 
were declared eligible to vote. Later edicts declared the equality of all 
nationalities and freedom of religion. On October 13, a decree announced 
that the traditional mandarinate had been abolished, and authority in 
local areas was to be established through elections for people's councils 
and administrative committees at all localities throughout the northern 
provinces.[21] 
</p><p>The new government concentrated its economic efforts on lowering tax rates, improving working conditions, and distributing farmland to the poor. 
In addition to the abolition of the land tax that had been 
imposed by the French, the capitation tax, which provided three quarters 
of government tax revenue, taxes on the manufacture of salt and alcohol, 
and various other commercial taxes were immediately suspended, while 
the consumption of opium and the practice of corvee were officially prohibited. 
An eight-hour working day was promulgated, and employers 
were notified that they must provide employees with advance notice 
before dismissal. In the countryside, land rents were ordered reduced by 
25 percent and all long-standing debts were abolished. 
</p><p>The government took no action, however, to nationalize industries or commercial establishments, nor did it embark on an ambitious land reform program to confiscate the farmlands of the affluent and redistribute them to the poor. 
For the moment, only the lands of French colonialists 
and Vietnamese traitors were to be seized. In his writings and 
statements during the Pacific War, Ho Chi Minh had made it clear that 
following a successful general insurrection at the end of the conflict, 
Vietnamese society would enter the first, national democratic stage of 
the Leninist revolutionary process. That stage would be characterized by 
the establishment of a broad united front government representing the 
vast bulk of the population and by moderate reformist policies in the 
social and economic arenas. 
</p><p>The decision by the provisional government to present a moderate face to the Vietnamese people was a calculated move by Ho Chi Minh and his senior colleagues to win the support of a broad cross-section of the people in order to focus on the key problem of containing the threat of foreign imperialism. 
Despite Ho's effort to avoid offending moderates, 
however, the government was not always able to control radical elements 
at the local level who wanted to settle personal scores or engage in class 
warfare. On some occasions village notables or mandarins were beaten, 
arrested, or even executed without trial. In some villages in central and 
northern Vietnam, newly elected councils abruptly declared the abolition 
of traditional religious rituals and confiscated the property of the affluent. 
To avoid complications, the government sent key Party members to reverse 
such measures and calm the ardent spirits of revolutionary elements. 
<br><br><b>While Ho Chi Minh was still putting the final touches on his speech in Ba Dinh Square, the first advance units of the Chinese occupation army had already crossed the border and were beginning to straggle into Hanoi. </b> 
To many Vietnamese observers, they were a ragtag 
lot, their yellow uniforms tattered and worn, their belongings slung on 
poles over their shoulders, their legs swollen from beriberi. Many of them 
were accompanied by wives and children. 
</p><p>These were not among the best troops in the Kuomintang Army. 
For political reasons, Chiang Kai-shek had abandoned plans to. use Zhang 
Fakui's crack Guangxi troops as the main force for his occupation of 
Indochina, and had directed Lu Han, a warlord of Yunnan province, to 
send units of his First Army down the Red River to Hanoi. In the 
meantime, General Xiao Wen, Ho Chi Minh's patron a few months 
earlier in Liuzhou, led units of Zhang Fakui's Guangxi army across the 
border at Lang Son. Lu Han was designated commander of the occupation 
force, which was expected to reach a strength of r8o,ooo men, while 
Xiao Wen was selected as his chief political adviser. In their baggage 
came Nguyen Hai Than, Vu Hong Khanh, and other members of the 
nationalist movement who had spent the war years living in exile in 
south China. 
</p><p>On September 9, the main body of General Lu Han's army entered Hanoi. 
Archimedes Patti described the scene: 
All through the night Lu Han's troops poured into the city; we 
could hear their traffic, the racing of motors, the shouted instructions. 
We awoke next morning to a scene of shocking contrast. The 
quality of the Chinese "army" had undergone a drastic change. Yesterday's 
elite corps was today a squatters' army. Crossing town I saw 
an almost incredible scene of confusion and aimlessly wandering 
Chinese. Sidewalks, doorways, and side streets were cluttered with 
solders and camp followers hovering over bundles of personal belongings, 
with household furnishings and military gear strewn 
everywhere. Many had staked claims in private gardens and courtyards 
and settled down to brew tea, do household chores and start 
the laundry.[22] 
</p><p>For Ho Chi Minh, the physical appearance of the newly arrived occupying army was less important than the question of its ultimate purpose. 
Ostensibly it had been dispatched to accept the surrender of 
Japanese troops and preserve law and order in Indochina until a new 
civilian administration could be established. But what kind of government 
did Chongqing foresee in Indochina, and what role would China 
play there in the postwar era? Although at the Cairo Conference in 1943 
Chiang Kai-shek had promised President Roosevelt that China had no 
intention of attempting to seize the country itself, there seemed little 
doubt that his government was determined to manipulate the local situation 
in order to maintain a degree of influence over the area. Then 
again, how would Chinese occupation authorities react to French efforts 
to restore colonial rule in regions under their administration? Although 
some Chinese military officers, such as General Zhang Fakui, were clearly 
anti-French, others might be tempted to reach a compromise with the 
French in order to extend Chinese interests. This was the concern Ho 
Chi Minh had expressed to Patti during their August 26 meeting. 
</p><p>Even before the launching of the August Revolution, Party leaders had turned their attention to the question of how to deal with the victorious Allied powers. 
At the meeting of the Party Central Committee 
held at Tan Trao in mid-August, Ho Chi Minh had explained to his 
colleagues the complexity of the problem and the need for the future 
provisional government to exploit the contradictions among the Allies 
for its own advantage. In that report, he provided some key insights into 
his view of the world scene, and how it might affect the Vietnamese 
revolution. In Ho's view, the most dangerous of the Allied powers were 
the French and the Chinese-the former because of their desire to restore 
the colonial edifice, and the latter because of the plots of Chinese officials 
to wrest control over the territory or to support the aspirations of pro-Chinese 
nationalists to seize political power in Hanoi. He predicted that 
the contradictions among the Allies might evolve in two different ways: 
First, differences might emerge between the United States and China on 
the one hand and Great Britain and France on the other over France's 
desire to restore colonial rule. This was something, he said, that Vietnam 
might be able to exploit. On the other hand, if tensions developed between 
all of the other Allied powers and the USSR, it could lead the 
United States and Great Britain to support the French and enable them 
to return to Indochina. 
</p><p>Under those circumstances, Ho Chi Minh recommended dividing the Allied powers into separate camps and developing distinct tactics to deal with each. 
With regard to the French, he explained, "we must avoid 
military conflict, but when they arrive, we must direct the masses to 
demonstrate against French plots to restore their old power in Indochina." 
As for the British and the Chinese, it would be advisable to avoid 
clashes with their occupation forces and to develop friendly relations with 
both governments, but if they began to intrude on the provisional government's 
authority, it would be necessary to mobilize the masses and 
demand national independence. Above all, it was important to avoid 
fighting alone, which would play into the hands of the French and their 
"running dogs" within the collaborationist camp in Indochina.[23] 
</p><p>Based on that scenario, the new government sought to handle the Chinese occupation authorities with kid gloves. 
When Ho Chi Minh's 
onetime patron Xiao Wen arrived in Hanoi to serve as GeneralL11 Han's 
political adviser, Ho was careful to stress the desire of his government 
to cooperate with the Chinese authorities, To minimize the danger of 
military clashes between Vietnamese and Chinese units, the VLA was - 
renamed the National Defense Guard (Ve quoc Quan), and the bulk of 
Giap's troops were pulled out of Hanoi, while other Vietnamese units 
stationed in the capital were carefully placed to avoid confrontations. 
When General Lu Han himself arrived on September 14, the government 
made no objection when he took over the Governor-General's Palace from 
the French as his own residence. To their discomfiture, Sainteny and his 
entourage were forced to move to a villa downtown near the Bank of 
Indochina, which was still under the ,control of the Japanese. 
</p><p>One potential difficulty between the government and the Chinese occupational administration was how to deal with Vietnamese nationalist politicians who had arrived in Hanoi with the Chinese army. 
While still 
en route through the Viet Bac to Hanoi, some nationalist politicians had 
attempted to occupy the headquarters of the local people's revolutionary 
committees, compelling the government to send envoys to the border 
provinces instructing local military units and civilian officials to avoid a 
confrontation with the new arrivals. Once they were in Hanoi, Nguyen 
Hai Than and his colleagues settled downtown and attempted to set up 
an "autonomous zone," where they began to agitate against the new 
government. 
<br><br><b>Clearly, in Ho Chi Minh's mind, the United States could play a key role in fending off the challenges from other world powers, and he had sought to exact every advantage from the tenuous relationship he had established with the OSS in the spring of 1945</b>. 
But Ho must have 
already sensed that his efforts had borne little fruit. Sometime in mid-August, 
he had written one final letter to Charles Fenn, his friend and 
associate with AGAS who was now preparing to return to the United 
States. It was good for everyone, he remarked, that the war was finished, 
but he felt badly that his American friends would be leaving him soon. 
"And their leaving," he said, "means that relations between you and us 
will be more difficult."[24] 
</p><p>Although in retrospect, his remarks appear prophetic, they were fully in character with his understanding of the nature of the world and the future policies of the United States. 
As the Pacific War came to an end, 
Ho viewed the United States as a crucial but enigmatic factor in his 
country's struggle for national independence. As a capitalist country, it 
represented a potential opponent of the future world revolution. On the 
other hand, President Roosevelt had emerged during the Pacific War as 
one of the most powerful and vocal spokesmen for the liberation of the 
oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa from colonial rule, and Ho apparently 
held out the possibility that Roosevelt's policies would continue 
to shape U.S. attitudes after the close of the war. 
</p><p>Ho's dual vision of the United States as a beacon for human freedom and a bastion of global capitalism was graphically demonstrated in the resolution issued by the Party Central Committee at Tan Trao in mid-August. 
On the one hand, Ho felt that U.S. dislike of European colonialism 
might prove useful in the Party's struggle to prevent the return 
of the French to power in Indochina. On the other hand, if tensions rose 
between the capitalist powers and the USSR, Washington might decide 
to make concessions to Paris in order to enlist the French in an effort to 
prevent the spread of communism. 
</p><p>When Harry S. Truman assumed the presidency on the death of Roosevelt in April, he tacitly abandoned his predecessor's waning effort to prevent the restoration of the French to power in Indochina. 
At the 
conference in San Francisco creating the United Nations in May, U.S. 
officials had indicated that they would not oppose the return of the 
French to Indochina after the end of the war. That policy change had 
been opposed by Asian specialists within the State Department, many of 
whom sympathized with Vietnamese aspirations for national independence; 
but the Department's Division of European Affairs had argued 
that U.S. opposition to French sovereignty over Indochina could complicate 
relations with Paris after the war and-with tensions between 
Moscow and Washington on the rise in Europe-their views had prevailed. 
Free French leader Charles de Gaulle had tried to assuage U.S. 
concerns by promising in March that Indochina would receive "an autonomy 
proportionate to her progress and attainments," and at San Francisco 
U.S. delegates had responded with the announcement that 
Washington would not press for the transformation of Indochina into an 
international trusteeship. Still, in deference to the views expressed by 
Asianists in the State Department, the administration "insisted on the 
necessity of providing a progressive measure of self-government for all 
dependent peoples looking toward their eventual independence or incorporation 
in some form of federation according to circumstances and the 
ability of the peoples to assume these responsibilities."[25] 
</p><p>In late August, just as the Vietminh were consolidating their power in Hanoi, de Gaulle met with Truman at the White House. 
Although 
Truman urged his visitor to pledge the future independence of Indochina, 
de Gaulle demurred, remarking that any public statement to that 
effect would be just "fine words." He did assure his host that the French 
government would take appropriate steps that would eventually lead to 
self-government for the peoples in the area. A few days later, the.,State. 
Department circulated a statement to the effect that the United Stat~ 
did not dispute the French claim of sovereignty in Indochina. tJnfortunately, 
news of that decision did not arrive in Chongqirig until October. 
As a result, Archimedes Patti and other Americans arriving in Indochina 
lacked formal instructions from the American Embassy there on future 
U.S. policies in the region. 
</p><p>Unaware that Patti was little better informed on current U.S. policies than he was, Ho Chi Minh concentrated his efforts on reassuring his visitor. 
In his meeting with Patti on August 26, Ho had already complained 
about Chinese intentions in Indochina, as well as those of the 
French. Then, on the day prior to the Independence Day ceremonies, Ho 
met with Patti again to complain that U.S. officials did not understand 
what the Chinese and the French were intending to do in Indochina. To 
relieve possible U.S. doubts about the ideological orientation of his government, 
he denied once again that the Vietminh Front was dominated 
by the ICP, and said that it was willing to accept a limited form of 
independence from the French (in his cable describing the meeting, Patti 
quoted Ho as demanding "limited independence, liberation from French 
rule, right to live as free people in family of nations and lastly right to 
deal directly with outside world"). As an additional inducement, he told 
Patti that his country badly needed U.S. investment and advice and 
implied a willingness to grant special concessions to U.S. commercial 
interests in Vietnam. 
</p><p>By his own account, Patti (like virtually every American who had met with Ho in the closing days of the war) was sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh and his new government, but he was operating under the restrictions relating to his assignment and the ambiguity of U.S. policy, and so refrained from making any promises. 
A short trip to Kunming in 
early September did not alleviate his concern. OSS chief Richard Heppner 
was angry at Patti's apparent willingness to mediate the Franco-Vietminh 
dispute and ordered him to refrain from future political activities. Left 
to his own devices, Ho Chi Minh decided to temporize with the Chinese. 
When General Xiao Wen met with him in early September and broadly 
hinted at the advisability of adding more non-Communist nationalist 
leaders to the provisional government, Ho replied that it was indeed his 
ultimate intention to "democratize" the government, but that elections 
could probably not take place until the end of the year.[26] 
<br><br><b>While Ho Chi Minh and his colleagues were trying to preserve their government's tenuous authority in Hanoi, the fragile position of their counterparts in south Vietnam was under a more immediate threat. </b> 
After the tumultuous events in Saigon on August 2 5, the 
situation there had begun to stabilize, as the Committee for the Southunder 
its Vietminh chairman, Tran Van Giau-attempted to consolidate 
its power in preparation for the imminent arrival of British occupation 
forces. A few days later, Hoang Quoc Viet arrived in Saigon as the 
representative of the Party Central Committee, and he undoubtedly advised 
Giau to avoid provocative actions or any confrontation with the 
British after they arrived. But Giau's position was a delicate one. He was 
forced to share power in the committee with representatives of rival 
parties, many of whom were not only deeply suspicious of the character 
and intentions of the Vietminh Front but were also ready to take advantage 
of any signs of Vietminh weakness toward the enemy, which 
would enable them to accuse Giau of selling out. To make it worse, 
despite the presence of Hoang Quoc Viet, Giau and his colleagues were 
still almost totally isolated from the Party leadership in Hanoi and forced 
to make decisions on their own. They had only just learned from Hoang 
Quoc Viet that the mysterious Ho Chi Minh was in reality Nguyen Ai 
Quoc. Long accustomed to taking action according to local circumstances, 
southern leaders did not respond with enthusiasm to Viet's suggestions 
(sometimes apparently phrased in the form of instructions). In 
return, Hoang Quoc Viet, a labor leader from a worker background with 
a strong bent toward ideological orthodoxy, apparently viewed Giau and 
his associates as petty bourgeois adventurers heavily tainted by the decadent 
character of life in capitalist Saigon. The mutual distrust between 
the northern and southern branches of the Party that had begun to 
emerge in the late 1930s was reinforced by the separate tracks followed 
by the two regions during and after the August Revolution. 
</p><p>On September 2, large crowds gathered in front of the Norodom Palace in the center of Saigon to celebrate Independence Day and listen to a radio broadcast of Ho Chi Minh's speech in Hanoi. 
But tensions 
ran high between Vietnamese and French residents within the city, and 
when demonstrators began to march down Rue Carinae, the affluent 
shopping street that led from the cathedral to the Saigon River, small-arms 
fire suddenly broke out in the square in front of the church. The 
crowd became agitated, and angry youths began to enter nearby buildings 
searching for French snipers. In the tumult that followed, Father 
Tricoire, the curator of the cathedral, was struck by a bullet and killed 
as he observed the events while standing on the steps. Fanned by popular 
hysteria, the violence spread, as mobs raided homes, looted shops, and 
roamed the streets looking for Europeans to beat up. Before the day was 
over ("black Sunday," the French press labeled it), four were dead and 
hundreds injured. 
</p><p>Over the next few days, Tran Van Giau counseled his followers to maintain their discipline and pleaded with them to avoid unnecessary provocations, but rival elements within the nationalist camp and the local Trotskyite faction lurked in the wings, eager to profit from any Vietminh misstep. 
Also opposed to Vietminh authority were two growing religious 
sects, the Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao, both of which had recently flourished 
in the fluid and unstable atmosphere of the Mekong delta in the 
early twentieth century. Syncretic in nature and eager to maintain authority 
over their own flocks, the two sects had already attained followings 
of several hundred thousand people and were determined to resist 
the infusion of outside authority. 
</p><p>On September 12, the first units of the British occupation force, most of them Gurkhas as well as a few French troops, arrived at Tan Son Nhut Airport. 
Their commander, British Major General Douglas Gracey, arrived 
the next day. Slim, mustachioed, and ramrod-straight, Gracey was 
e~ery inch the image of a British general. He was the son of a colonial 
civil servant in India, and a graduate of Sandhurst. His own Twentieth 
Indian Division had just completed a long and successful stint fighting 
the Japanese in Burma, and Gracey had spent much of his own career 
in colonial areas, where he had earned the respect of his own troops, 
many of them Asians, for his courage and fair-mindedness. To many 
observers, he must have seemed an ideal appointment for the challenging 
task of accepting Japanese surrender and maintaining law and order in 
Indochina until a political settlement could be achieved. 
</p><p>Right from the start, however, problems arose. 
In the first place, 
Gracey was not suited by personal experience or political instinct for his 
delicate assignment. Long service in the British army had solidified in 
his mind the conviction that colonial rule over Asian territories was 
inevitable and correct. Second, his assignment was ambiguous. While in 
Rangoon, he had been assigned command of all Allied land forces in 
Indochina south of the Sixteenth Parallel, but en route to Saigon, his 
orders were amended by Lieutenant General William]. Slim, commander 
in chief of British land forces in the Southeast Asian Theater. Gracey 
was instructed to maintain law and order only in key areas of the country, 
unless requested by French authorities or by authority of General Louis 
Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander for the Southeast Asia 
Command (SEAC), which, from its headquarters in Ceylon, had helped 
to direct Allied operations in much of the region during the Pacific War. 
By implication, General Slim was assigning the southern half of Indochina 
back to the French. 
</p><p>Conditions in Saigon on Gracey's arrival were also not optimal. 
With 
the surrender of the Japanese, the primary linchpin for maintaining law 
and order had been removed, and the city was now patrolled by Vietnamese 
police, who owed allegiance to no one. When, on September 8, 
Tran Van Giau had appealed to the local population for quiet and cooperation 
with the Committee for the South, he was severely criticized 
by militant nationalists, and even by some members of his own Party, 
who suspected him of being a "lackey" of the French. The next day, the 
committee was reorganized, and Giau resigned his chairmanship in favor 
of the nationalist Pham Van Bach. The composition of the committee 
was broadened, so that the Vietminh membership were only four out of 
thirteen. On September 12, French prisoners of war who had just been 
released from jail by newly arrived French troops in Gmcey's detachment 
began to carouse through the streets, looting stores and attacking Vietnamese 
pedestrians. Appalled by the anarchic conditions that he found 
in the city, Gracey turned to the only stable element he could find, 
ordering Japanese troops to disarm all Vietnamese and evict the Committee 
for the South from the governor-general's residence in downtown 
Saigon. The British command headquarters then announced that British 
troops would maintain law and order until the restoration of French 
colonial authority.[27] 
</p><p>Under instructions from Hanoi to avoid providing the British with a pretext for further intervention, Tran Van Giau and other members of the committee sought to prevent an outbreak of outright conflict, but as a precaution Giau began to evacuate key Vietminh units from the city. 
During the next few days, Gracey's forces started to cleanse the 
metropolitan area of all rebellious elements. In the meantime, Tran Van 
Giau and other members of the Committee for the South sought a compromise 
with Jean Cedile, the senior French representative in Cochin 
China. Cedile, who had parachuted into Cochin China on August 22, 
was liberal-minded and a moderate in his political views, but the talks 
went nowhere. Cedile demanded that the political future of Indochina 
be discussed only after the restoration of French authority, while Giau 
insisted on a prior French recognition of Vietnamese national independence. 
Further negotiations, held in September at the instigation of U.S. 
Lieutenant Colonel A. Peter Dewey, Patti's OSS counterpart in the south, 
foundered on the same issue, as hard-line elements on each side prevented 
any tendency toward accommodation. It was, as the French diplomat 
Bernard de Folio noted, a dialogue of the deaf. 
</p><p>By mid-September, Pham Van Bach, the new chairman of the Committee for the South, had become convinced that a settlement with the French was impossible, so he called for a general strike on September 17. 
Gracey countered by declaring martial law, releasing and rearming 
the remaining French, prisoners-many of them Legionnaires-and ordering 
them to restore order. Inevitably, clashes between French and 
Vietnamese troops took place, further inflaming the situation. On the 
night of the twenty-second, Cedile ordered French troops to take control 
of key installations in the city and evict the Committee for the South 
from its latest headquarters in the ornate Saigon City Hall. In the process, 
several Vietnamese soldiers were killed or taken prisoner. When they 
awoke the following morning, the 20,000 French residents of the city 
rejoiced to discover that once again Saigon was under French control. 
Many took to the streets, assaulting the Vietnamese they encountered—men, 
women, and children—at random. Hundreds, and perhaps 
thousands, were injured. 
</p><p>Colonel Dewey, the senior U.S. representative in Saigon, was appalled by Cedile's peremptory action. 
A Yale graduate and a onetime correspondent 
for the Chicago Daily News who had been recruited by the OSS 
in 1943 and served in the European Theater, the twenty-eight-year-old 
Dewey was the son of a former U.S. ambassador to Paris and spoke fluent 
French but shared the anticolonial predilections of Archimedes Patti in 
Hanoi. Dewey immediately went to British headquarters to complain to 
Gracey, but the general refused to receive him. Indeed, Gracey blamed 
much of the recent troubles in Saigon on the activities of the OSS detachment, 
which he labeled "blatantly subversive," and demanded that 
Dewey leave Indochina as soon as possible. But he did agree to order 
French troops off the streets and turned the task of maintaining law and 
order entirely over to the Japanese.[28] 
</p><p>Up until now, Vietminh representatives in Saigon had made it clear that radical actions, such as those that had occurred during "black Sunday" on September 2, were not part of the current stage of the Vietnamese revolution and would be severely punished, but such orders were widely ignored. 
On September 24, several hundred armed Vietnamese, 
many of them allegedly members of the Cao Dai or the Binh Xuyen, a 
local crime syndicate that ran vice operations in Saigon, ran rampant 
through the Cite Herault, a French residential section, calling out "death 
to the Europeans." Although the neighborhood was technically under 
Japanese guard, more than 150 Europeans were massacred, many of them 
women and children, while the Japanese troops stood by without intervening. 
One hundred hostages were led away, never to be seen again. 
The violence spread into the surrounding rural areas, where peasant riots 
destroyed many estates, seized and redistributed the land of the wealthy, 
and killed several landlords. 
</p><p>By now Tran Van Giau had lost confidence in his ability to bring about a compromise. 
Fearing that nationalist rivals would seize control 
over the movement, he called for a new general strike and ordered his 
followers to evacuate the city, which he now planned to place under 
siege. Barricades were erected to prevent French citizens from leaving 
Saigon, and to keep Vietnamese from entering from the outside. In a 
cable to Patti in Hanoi, Dewey (who had recently described the unrest 
in the south as a "popgun war") reported that "Cochin China is burning," 
and urged that the Americans "ought to clear out of Southeast Asia." 
The next afternoon, while Dewey was about to leave for the airport, he 
was fired upon in his Jeep at one of the Vietnamese barricades in the 
city, and he was instantly killed. Shortly after, the OSS headquarters 
nearby was placed under attack by Vietnamese units for several hours, 
until the area was cleared by Gracey's Gurkhas.[29] 
</p><p>The death of Colonel Dewey, the first American to die in the Vietnamese revolution, caused lengthy and bitter recriminations; accusations of blame were levied from all sides. 
An (investigation of the 
incident by the local ass team concluded that there was no evidence 
of a sinister plot against Dewey or the Americans by the Vietminh. In 
fact, Americans in Saigon at the time were convinced that the Vietnamese 
viewed them as separate from other Westerners, and more 
sympathetic to their aspirations for national independence. Partial responsibility 
for the incident was placed at the feet of General Gracey, 
since Gracey had refused Dewey's request to fly an American flag on 
his Jeep, arguing that as he was not an officer of flag rank he did not 
merit the privilege. There was indeed bad blood between Gracey and 
the U.S. military contingent in Saigon. Reports by OSS officers concluded 
that the incident was probably a case of mistaken identity, 
with the Vietnamese troops assuming that the Jeep was carrying 
French troops. When he heard the news from Patti, Ho Chi Minh was 
severely shaken, and later he wrote a personal letter to President Truman, 
expressing his regret for the incident.[30] 
</p><p>The incident also had repercussions at SEAC. 
Press reports of the 
The Days of August 3 3 7 
situation in Saigon had damaged the reputation of the British role in 
the peace-keeping force in Indochina. Displeased by the events of late 
September, Lord Mountbatten met with Cedile and General Gracey in 
Singapore and instructed them to seek a cease-fire and a peaceful settlement 
of the spreading dispute. He criticized Gracey for attempting to 
apply law and order in an indiscriminate manner throughout Cochin 
China and for his refusal to deal with Vietnamese authorities. But 
Mountbatten's intervention had little effect in softening the positions 
adopted by either side. In early October, French troops under the command 
of General Henri Leclerc began to arrive in Saigon, and a few days 
later-with French residents in the city celebrating at the newly opened 
Cercle Sportif just behind the governor-general's residence-Gracey 
signed an agreement turning authority over from his occupation command 
to the French in all areas of Indochina south of the 16th parallel.[31] 
</p><p>On October 10, Tran Van Giau's forces attacked French and British troops at the Tan Son Nhut Airport and on roads at checkpoints entering the city. 
During the next few weeks, remnants of the military units of 
the Vietminh and other nationalist groups opposed ,~o, the French were 
driven inexorably out of the Saigon metropolitan area. Vietminh cadres 
operating under the command of Le Duan, who had spent the war years 
in prison, met secretly somewhere in the Mekong delta to begin preparations 
for war. But Vietminh forces lacked the strength and experience 
to deal with the French, who were methodically driving the Vietnamese 
away from the suburbs and into the swamps and jungles. In the meantime, 
Hoang Quoc Viet attempted to bring about the unification of the 
diverse political parties and the two millennarian religious sects for a 
concerted effort against the French. 
</p><p>As the situation in Cochin China deteriorated, the government in Hanoi did what it could to help. 
On September 26, Ho Chi Minh broadcast 
a radio message to his compatriots in the south, promising them 
that the entire nation would mobilize its strength to seek ultimate victory. 
In some provinces in central Vietnam, entire villages went south 
to fight the French. In private, however, Ho counseled patience to his 
colleagues, citing examples in Vietnamese history when ultimate victory 
required protracted war.[32] 
<br><br><b>Indeed, the new government was in no position to fight a war. </b> 
The economic situation in the north was still dire, and although no French 
troops were stationed in the area, nationalist parties represented an increasingly 
vocal challenge. Behind them loomed the Chinese. Faced with 
threats from all sides, Ho Chi Minh maneuvered desperately to seek out 
allies and isolate adversaries. To placate Lu Han, the commander of the 
Chinese occupation troops, he ordered a subordinate to provide him with 
opium. To furnish an additional symbol of legitimacy for his fragile 
government, he asked former emperor Bao Dai, now citizen Vinh Thuy, 
to serve as his political adviser. Arriving from Hue on September 6, 
Vinh Thuy met immediately with Ho Chi Minh, who expressed his 
disapproval of the pressure that had been applied to persuade the emperor 
to abdicate. "Personally," Ho remarked, "I had envisaged that you would 
remain head of state and I would serve as the head of government." At 
a dinner held a few days later, Ho offered him the position of supreme 
counselor. Vinh Thuy accepted.[33] 
</p><p>Still, the most pressing immediate challenge came from the Vietminh's nationalist competitors. 
Ho Chi Minh's old rival Nguyen Hai 
Than, now a septuagenarian but still a leading member of the Dong 
Minh Hoi, had been attacking the government-which he described as 
"Ho and his gang of cutthroats"-for its willingness to compromise with 
the French. Dai Viet leaders also entered the city in September from c 
south China and began to voice a similar message in their party newspaper. 
Despite Ho's efforts to present a friendly and moderate image to 
the population, there was little that he could do to diminish the hostility 
and suspicion of rival nationalist elements, many of whom had become 
convinced by their wartime experience in south China that long-term 
cooperation with Ho and his Vietminh colleagues was impossible. To 
nationalist leaders, the unilateral seizure of power by the Vietminh in 
Hanoi at the end of the war was ample proof of Ho's treachery and 
double-dealing. While such elements lacked the political and military 
strength to compete directly with the Vietminh-Patti noted later that 
none of the nationalist leaders appeared to have a socioeconomic program 
to deal with the situation and were "hopelessly disoriented politically"they 
possessed a crucial trump card in their credibility with the Chinese 
occupation forces. Convinced that the Chinese would ultimately be forced 
to support them, nationalists like Vu Hong Khanh adopted a hard line 
in talks with the Vietminh. Khanh's party, the VNQDD, set up an 
opposition newspaper and a loudspeaker at its downtown headquarters, 
both of which began to denounce the "red terror."[34] 
</p><p>But Ho's rivals were divided, not only among themselves but also in their relations with the Chinese. 
Elements connected with the Dong 
Minh Hoi sided with General Xiao Wen, who was increasingly angry 
with Ho Chi Minh for his independent stance and now hoped for an 
early departure of both Japanese and Chinese troops to bring about the 
emergence of an independent government under nationalist leadership. 
Other groups, such as the VNQDD and the Dai Viet, supported Lu 
Han, who anticipated a lengthy Chinese occupation as a means of cementing 
Sino-Vietnamese relations. 
</p><p>Some observers claimed to see divisions within the Vietminh camp as well. 
According to the French journalist Philippe Devillers, who was 
then posted in Hanoi, there were at least three camps within the government: 
an old guard consisting of veteran Communists such as Hoang 
Quoc Viet, Tran Huy Lieu, and Ho Tung Mau; a group of more pragmatic 
members who had pursued legal careers during the 1930s, such 
as Vo Nguyen Giap, Hoang Minh Giam, and Giap's father-in-law, Dang 
Thai Mai; and a group of non-Communists who had rallied to the Vietminh 
cause for patriotic reasons. In Devillers's interpretation, Ho Chi 
Minh maneuvered skillfully among these factions, taking issue with colleagues 
who wanted to adopt a hard line ,with their nationalist rivals and 
arguing for a policy of conciliation. Ho's view can be seen in the comment 
of one Party publication, which .said that nationalist parties should 
be neutralized gradually in order to wipe out their forces "step by step." 
When a member of his government expressed outrage at the behavior of 
nationalist elements, Ho counseled him to be patient, promising that 
such issues would be dealt with once the government was firmly in 
power. As the rhetoric on all sides became more inflamed, Ho Chi Minh 
was forced to take increasing precautions to guarantee his own safety, 
moving his residence frequently in order to avoid surprise attack.[35] 
</p><p>In Ho's view, the best way to deal with the Party's nationalist rivals was to placate the Chinese occupation authorities. 
There was as yet no 
indication as to when Chinese troops would leave Indochina. In late 
September, General Lu Han made it clear that there was no timetable 
for the departure of Chinese troops. By early October-after one of 
Chiang Kai-shek's favorite commanders, He Yingqin, arrived in Hanoi 
to urge Lu Han to devise a plan to keep the Vietnamese Communists 
from consolidating power-their immediate withdrawal appeared even 
less likely. 
</p><p>The French, of course, represented the main and greatest challenge. 
If the rest of the victorious Allies grouped together against the Soviets, 
the French could very well resume sovereignty in Indochina, and, however 
distasteful that might be, it would have to be at least temporarily 
accepted. In mid-September, in an attempt to placate the potential enemy, 
Ho Chi Minh began secret negotiations with French representatives 
General Marcel Alessandri and Leon Pignon (Jean Sainteny had left for 
consultations in India). In interviews with Western journalists, Ho in 
dicated that the French would be welcomed back to Indochina as advisers, 
provided that they came as friends, not conquerors.[36] 
<br><br><b>With Chinese commanders supporting the nationalist parties in the north and the British operating hand in glove with the French in the south, the United States represented the last best hope for Ho Chi Minh as a possible patron for the government in Hanoi. </b> 
During the 
late summer and early fall, Ho attempted to cultivate his American 
contacts, notably Archimedes Patti, who was obviously sympathetic ro 
the cause of Vietnamese independence as well as the most senior U.S. 
representative in Hanoi. Despite the displeasure of his superiors in 
Chongqing, who were concerned at his increasingly favorable attitude 
tOward the new Vietnamese government, Patti continued to report on 
conditions in Indochina, and in early September he cabled that although 
the new government was clearly leftist, it apparently was in full control 
of the situation and fully prepared to resist the return of the French. A 
few weeks later he reponed on the goals of the Vietnamese leaders, 
indicating that they intended to seek national independence in ten years, 
with a French governor-general tO serve until then as chief of state. 
Having observed the U.S. record in the Philippines, he reponed, the 
Vietnamese would prefer to become a U.S. protectorate until the restoration 
of complete independence, but they recognized the unlikelihood 
of that and would be happy to accept temporary French administration, 
so long as it was under the watchful eye of the United Nations.[37] 
</p><p>But the U.S. attitude about the situation in Indochina was still ambiguous. 
One reason for that ambiguity was that policy differences between 
Europeanists and Asianists in the State Department had flared up 
again. Through cables from Patti and information from diplomatic missions 
elsewhere in Asia, Washington was well aware that the Vietminh 
government was Communist in orientation; close observers knew that 
Ho Chi Minh himself was in fact the veteran Comintern agent Nguyen 
Ai Quoc. Asianists were becoming increasingly concerned at the drift 
toward war in Indochina. On September 28, Assistant Secretary for Far 
East Affairs John Carter Vincent (later to become one of the prominent 
victims of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade) raised 
the issue with Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson, warning that the 
current "hands-off" policy of not opposing the restoration of French sovereignty 
in Indochina could result in a full-fledged crisis, since Paris appeared determined 
to restore its authority prior to opening negotiations 
with the Vietnamese government. Vincent proposed that the United 
States join with Great Britain in establishing a commission to investigate 
the situation in Indochina. Pending the final report, he suggested that 
no additional French troops be authorized to land in Indochina. The 
commission report, he concluded, could become the basis for international 
discussions among concerned countries, including appropriate 
"Annamese" representatives. Vincent conceded that Paris might resent 
such initiatives, but he pointed out that this would be less dangerous 
than an explosion of Annamese nationalism.[38] 
</p><p>Europeanists in the State Department took issue with such reasoning. 
H. Freeman Mathews, chief of the Division of European Affairs, argued 
that it would be preferable to see if the British and the French could 
work out the problem themselves. A commission, Europeanists feared, 
could lead to only one result-the eventual eviction of the French from 
Indochina. It could also encourage Moscow to demand a role in the 
region for the USSR. This, said one, "would be bad for the French and 
the West, and generally be bad for the Indochinese themselves." Acheson, 
by instinct and training a Europeanist, agreed with Mathews, and 
he rejected action unless the situation deteriorated markedly. On October 
20 Vincent issued an official statement reiterating U.S. policy and declaring 
that the United States did not question French and Dutch sovereignty 
over their Southeast Asian colonies, but that it expected the 
European colonial powers to prepare their subject peoples for the duties 
and responsibilities of self-government.[39] 
</p><p>The French clearly did not want any interference. 
In late October an 
official of the French Embassy in Washington, D.C., met with Far Eastern 
Division staff member Abbot Low Moffat to complain about a report 
that a representative from Ho Chi Minh's government was en route to 
Washington to discuss the situation with U.S. officials. Any such interference 
by the United States, the embassy official warned, "would be 
considered an unfriendly act" by the French government.[40] 
</p><p>Ho Chi Minh was not aware of such events in the United States, but he was clearly concerned at the trend in U.S. policy. 
On September 30, 
Patti's last day in Indochina, he invited Patti to the Northern Palace for 
a final conversation. In a tête-à-tête after dinner, Ho remarked that he 
could not reconcile the official U.S. position on self-determination that 
had been laid out at the Tehran, Quebec, and Potsdam conferences with 
the current policy of standing aside and permitting the British and the 
Chinese to assist in the return of the French to Indochina. Does not the 
Atlantic Charter, he asked, apply to Vietnam? Ho suggested the formation 
of a pan-Asian community including several of the colonial possessions 
in the region and assisted by political and economic programs 
for the common good. Patti expressed his personal sympathy for the 
Vietnamese struggle for independence, but reiterated official U.S. policy 
that neither questioned French sovereignty nor supported Paris's imperialist 
ambitions. At the close of the conversation, Ho recounted to his 
visitor some of the key events in his life as a revolutionary. Conceding 
that many Americans viewed him as a "Moscow puppet," Ho denied that 
he was a Communist in the American sense. Having repaid his debt to 
the Soviet Union with fifteen years of Party work, he now considered 
himself a free agent. In recent months, he pointed out, the DR V had 
received more support from the United States than from the USSR. Why 
should it be indebted to Moscow? 
</p><p>As they parted, Ho Chi Minh asked his visitor to carry back a message that the Vietnamese people would always be grateful for the assistance they received from the United States and would long recall it as a friend and ally, and that the American struggle for independence would always serve as an example for Vietnam. 
A few weeks later, a letter from 
Ho Chi Minh to President Truman was carried to Kunming by another 
departing U.S. military officer. But the likelihood of any U.S. assistance 
was rapidly dimming. Patti's activities had strengthened suspicions 
among U.S. officials in both China and the United States, and when his 
successor cabled Washington that Hanoi would welcome a U.S. effort to 
mediate the dispute, both Hanoi's offer and Ho's previous letters were 
ignored.[41] 
<br><br><b>By the early fall of 1945, the immediate results of the August Revolution had clearly come into view. </b> 
The DRV was in control of the 
north, but its support was based almost entirely on the euphoria brought 
on by the promise of independence and the popularity of its mysterious 
president, Ho Chi Minh. Moreover, the area was still under occupation' 
by Chinese nationalist troops. In the south, where the Parry's support 
had been weakened by the abortive 1940 insurrection and competition 
from nationalists was substantially greater, the French had managed to 
restore colonial authority, although Vietminh activists were struggling 
to build a resistance base in the countryside. 
</p><p>For Ho Chi Minh, the key to unraveling the knot was on the international scene, where he counted on assistance from progressive forces to prevent the French from seeking to restore their colonial empire. 
As a 
student of modern revolution, he was aware of the prospects for a postwar 
wave of revolutionary expansion similar to that which had brought the 
Bolsheviks to power in I9I7• But long experience warned him that Stalin 
had only a fitful interest in Asia and could not be counted on to throw 
the weight of the Soviet Union on the side of revolutionary forces there. 
The other potential source of support was the United States, where anticolonial 
sentiment remained strong. But prospects for assistance from 
Washington were decidedly uncertain. Should the wartime alliance between 
the United States and the Soviet Union come to an end under the 
stress of postwar conditions, the "United States might be driven into the 
arms of the European colonial powers, and Vietnam could become a pawn 
in a new global conflict. In that case, Ho Chi Minh could have little 
doubt as to where his primary allegiance lay. At this stage in the Vietnamese 
revolution, the primary adversary was France. While Moscow 
could not be counted upon to provide firm support to the Vietnamese 
struggle for national independence, there was little risk that it would 
come to the assistance of France in seeking to restore colonial authority 
in Indochina. But for Washington, whose fear of world revolution he 
had clearly underscored in his remarks at the Tan Trao conference in 
August, the same could not be said.. 
</p><p>Still, although the road ahead was strewn with obstacles, the first step had been taken, and a newly independent Vietnamese government held tenuous power in Hanoi. 
In later years, the August Revolution 
would become inflated to almost mythic proportions, as Party historians 
in Hanoi portrayed the events at the end of the Pacific War as a testimony 
to the genius of the Communist Party and its great leader. The 
strategy behind the uprising-described as a combination of political 
and military struggle to seize power in both urban and rural areas became 
a prototype for future struggles of national liberation, not only 
in Vietnam but also in other parts of the Third W odd, such as Africa, 
Latin America, and other parts of Southeast Asia. 
</p><p>In recent years, that view has come under close scrutiny from a number of Western scholars, some of whom have argued that the element of planning was relatively limited in what was essentially a spontaneous popular uprising. 
Others contend that the events of August did not 
constitute a revolution, but a mere coup d'etat. There is some truth in 
both observations, for there is an element of chance in all revolutions. 
Lenin once noted that revolution is much more complex in theory than 
in reality; despite all the careful planning that had gone into the Party's 
efforts in its mountain base at Tan Trao, there was a distinct aura of 
spontaneity and improvisation about the insurrection that erupted at the 
moment of Japanese surrender to Allied forces in Asia. In many areas, 
Party activists were not even in touch with the Central Committee in 
the north and were compelled to take actions on their own. And, of 
course, the terrible famine that had swept the land during the last 
months of the war laid the groundwork for a swell of popular anger that 
thrust Ho Chi Minh and his comrades to victory. 
</p><p>Such observations, however, should not blind us to the fact that the August Revolution was an extraordinary achievement. 
Revolutions are 
not waged without revolutionaries. It is to the credit of the Party and 
its leadership that it was able to grasp the opportunity that beckoned so 
enticingly at the end of the Pacific War. Where other nationalist leaders 
were content to remain in south China and await the defeat of Japan by 
the Allies, Ho and his colleagues rose to the challenge and presented the 
world with a fait accompli. 
</p><p>By portraying the Vietminh Front as a broad-based movement armed with a program that could appeal to all progressive and patriotic forces, Ho not only managed to extend its appeal well beyond the normal constituency of the Communist Party, but he also put it into position to lobby for recognition by the victorious Allies as the legitimate voice of Vietnamese nationalism. 
Not all of his colleagues were comfortable with 
that moderate image. No less an observer than Truong Chinh later lamented 
that there had not been enough blood spilt during the August 
Revolution to rid the Party of its future enemies.[42] 
</p><p>That moderate face, it is clear, was that of Ho Chi Minh himself. 
In 
portraying himself as the avuncular figure from the countryside, the 
"simple patriot" in a worn khaki suit and blue cloth sandals, Ho won 
not only the hearts of millions of Vietnamese, but also the admiration 
and respect of close observers, such as U.S. military officers like Charles 
Fenn and Archimedes Patti, and French negotiators like Jean Sainteny 
and General Leclerc. There was, of course, an element of calculation in 
Ho Chi Minh's pose, and to some intimates he occasionally let slip that 
he was well aware of the artifice. But the tactic was an enormous success, 
and it is no surprise that he would adopt it as a crucial element in his 
strategical arsenal for the rest of his life.[43] 
</p><p>Yet there was also a risk in adopting the tactics of moderation, 
for in so doing Ho and his colleagues had come to power under false pretenses. 
The program of the Vietminh Front was not a blueprint for the future Vietnam, 
but only a starting point. If and when the Party decided to show its true face 
and objectives to the world, the risk of popular disillusion would be great. 
But Ho Chi Minh was above all a pragmatist. As he declared to the U.S. journalist 
Harold R. Isaacs during an interview in the fall of 1945, "Independence is the thing.
