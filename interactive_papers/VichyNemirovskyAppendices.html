APPENDIX 1<br><br>
<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky’s handwritten notes on the situation in France and her plans for Suite Française, taken from her notebooks<br><br>
<br><br>
My God! what is this country doing to me? Since it is rejecting me, let us consider it coldly, let us watch as it loses its honour and its life. And the other countries? What are they to me? Empires are dying. Nothing matters. Whether you look at it from a mystical or a personal point of view, it’s just the same. Let us keep a cool head. Let us harden our heart. Let us wait.<br><br>
21 June.*1 Conversation with Pied-de-Marmite. France is going to join hands with Germany. Soon they will be calling up people here but “only the young ones.” This was said no doubt out of consideration towards Michel. One army is crossing Russia, the other is coming from Africa. Suez has been taken. Japan with its formidable fleet is fighting America. England is begging for mercy.<br><br>
25 June. Unbelievable heat. The garden is decked out with the colours of June—azure, pale-green and pink. I lost my pen. There are still many other worries such as the threat of a concentration camp, the status of Jews etc. Sunday was unforgettable. The thunderbolt about Russia*2 hit our friends after their “mad night” down by the lake. And in order to [?] with them, everyone got drunk. Will I write about it one day?<br><br>
28 June. They’re leaving. They were depressed for twenty-four hours, now they’re cheerful, especially when they’re together. The little dear one sadly said, “The happy times are over.” They’re sending their packages home. They’re overexcited, that’s obvious. Admirably disciplined and, I think, no rebellion in their hearts. I swear here and now never again to take out my bitterness, no matter how justifiable, on a group of people, whatever their race, religion, convictions, prejudices, errors. I feel sorry for these poor children. But I cannot forgive certain individuals, those who reject me, those who coldly abandon us, those who are prepared to stab you in the back. Those people . . . if I could just get my hands on them . . . When will it all end? The troops that were here last summer said “Christmas,” then July. Now end ’41.<br><br>
There’s been talk here about de-occupying France except for the no-go area and the coasts. Carefully rereading the Journal Officiel*3 has thrown me back to feeling the way I did a few days ago,<br><br>
To lift such a heavy weight<br><br>
Sisyphus, you will need all your courage.<br><br>
I do not lack the courage to complete the task<br><br>
But the end is far and time is short.<br><br>
The Wine of Solitude by Irène Némirovsky for Irène Némirovsky<br><br>
30 June 1941. Stress the Michauds. People who always pay the price and the only ones who are truly noble. Odd that the majority of the masses, the detestable masses, are made up of these courageous types. The majority doesn’t get better because of them nor do they [the courageous types] get worse.<br><br>
Which scenes deserve to be passed on for posterity?<br><br>
1                  Waiting in queues at dawn.<br><br>
2                  The arrival of the Germans.<br><br>
3                  The killings and shooting of hostages much less than the profound indifference of the people.<br><br>
4                  If I want to create something striking, it is not misery I will show but the prosperity that contrasts with it.<br><br>
5                  When Hubert escapes from the prison where the poor wretches have been taken, instead of describing the death of the hostages, it’s the party at the Opera House I must show, and then simply people sticking posters up on the walls: so and so was shot at dawn. The same after the war and without dwelling on Corbin. Yes! It must be done by showing contrasts: one word for misery, ten for egotism, cowardice, closing ranks, crime. Won’t it be wonderful! But it’s true that it’s this very atmosphere I’m breathing. It is easy to imagine it: the obsession with food.<br><br>
6                  Think also about the Mass on Rue de la Source, early morning while it’s still completely dark. Contrasts! Yes, there’s something to that, something that can be very powerful and very new. Why have I used it so little in Dolce? Yet, rather than dwelling on Madeleine—for example, perhaps the whole Madeleine–Lucile chapter can be left out, reduced to a few lines of explanation, which can go into the Mme Angellier–Lucile chapter. On the other hand, describe in minute detail the preparations for the German celebration. It is perhaps an impression of ironic contrast, to receive the force of the contrast. The reader has only to see and hear.*4<br><br>
Characters in order of appearance (as far as I can remember):<br><br>
The Péricands—the Cortes—the Michauds—the landowners—Lucile—the louts?—the farmers etc.—the Germans—the aristocrats.<br><br>
Good, need to include in the beginning: Hubert, Corte, Jules Blanc, but that would destroy my unified tone for Dolce. Definitely I think I have to leave Dolce as is and on the other hand reintroduce all the characters from Storm, but in such a way that they have a momentous affect on Lucile, Jean-Marie and the others (and France).<br><br>
I think that (for practical reasons) Dolce should be short. In fact, in comparison with the eighty pages of Storm, Dolce will probably have about sixty or so, no more. Captivity, on the other hand, should make a hundred. Let’s say then:<br><br>
<br><br>
STORM                  80 pages<br><br>
DOLCE                  60                           ″<br><br>
CAPTIVITY100                           ″<br><br>
The two others                  50                           ″<br><br>
390,*5 let’s say 400 pages, multiplied by four. Lord! That makes 1,600 typed pages! Well, well, if I live in it!*6 In the end, if the people who have promised to come arrive on 14 July, then that will have certain consequences, including at least one, maybe two sections less.<br><br>
In fact, it’s like music when you sometimes hear the whole orchestra, sometimes just the violin. At least it should be like that. Combine [two words in Russian] and individual emotions. What interests me here is the history of the world.<br><br>
Beware: forget the reworking of characters. Obviously, the time-span is short. The first three parts, in any case, will only cover a period of three years. As for the last two, well that’s God’s secret and what I wouldn’t give to know it. But because of the intensity, the gravity of the experiences, the people to whom things happen must change (. . .)<br><br>
My idea is for it to unravel like a film, but at times the temptation is great, and I’ve given in with brief descriptions or in the episode that follows the meeting at the school by giving my own point of view. Should I mercilessly pursue this?<br><br>
Think about as well: the famous “impersonality” of Flaubert and his kind lies only in the greater fact with which they express their feelings—dramatising them, embodying them in living form, instead of stating them directly?<br><br>
Such*7 . . . there are other times when no one must know what Lucile feels in her heart, rather show her through other people’s eyes.<br><br>
1942<br><br>
The French grew tired of the Republic as if she were an old wife. For them, the dictatorship was a brief affair, adultery. But they intended to cheat on their wife, not to kill her. Now they realise she’s dead, their Republic, their freedom. They’re mourning her.<br><br>
For years, everything done in France within a certain social class has had only one motive: fear. This social class caused the war, the defeat and the current peace. The Frenchmen of this caste hate no one; they feel neither jealousy nor disappointed ambition, nor any real desire for revenge. They’re scared. Who will harm them the least (not in the future, not in the abstract, but right now and in the form of kicks in the arse or slaps in the face)? The Germans? The English? The Russians? The Germans won but the beating has been forgotten and the Germans can protect them. That’s why they’re “for the Germans.” At school, the weakest student would rather be bullied than be free; the tyrant bullies him but won’t allow anyone else to steal his marbles, beat him up. If he runs away from the bully, he is alone, abandoned in the free-for-all.<br><br>
There is a huge gulf between this caste, which is the caste of our current leaders, and the rest of the nation. The rest of the French, because they own less, are less afraid. If cowardice stops stifling the positive feelings in our souls (patriotism, love of freedom etc.), then they can rise up. Of course, many people have recently built fortunes, but they are fortunes in depreciated currency that are impossible to transform into concrete goods, land, jewellery, gold etc. Our butcher, who won five hundred thousand francs in a currency whose exchange rate abroad he knows (exactly zero), cares less about money than a Péricand, a Corbin*8 cares about their property, their banks etc. More and more, the world is becoming divided into the haves and the have nots. The first don’t want to give anything up and the second want to take everything. Who will win out?<br><br>
The most hated men in France in 1942: Philippe Henriot*9 and Pierre Laval. The first as the Tiger, the second as the Hyena: around Henriot you can smell fresh blood, and around Laval the stench of rotting flesh.<br><br>
<br><br>
Mers-el-Kébirpainful stupor<br><br>
Syriaindifference<br><br>
Madagascareven greater indifference<br><br>
All in all, it’s only the initial shock that counts. People get used to everything, everything that happens in the occupied zone: massacres, persecution, organised pillaging, are like arrows shot into mire! . . . the mire of our hearts.<br><br>
They’re trying to make us believe we live in the age of the “community,” when the individual must perish so that society may live, and we don’t want to see that it is society that is dying so the tyrants can live.<br><br>
This age that believes itself to be the age of the “community” is more individualistic than the Renaissance or the era of the great feudal lords. Everything is happening as if there were a fixed amount of freedom and power in the world that is sometimes divided between millions of people and sometimes between one single person and the other millions. “Have my leftovers,” the dictators say. So please don’t talk to me about the spirit of the community. I’m prepared to die but as a French citizen and I insist there be a valid reason for my death, and I, Jean-Marie Michaud,*10 I am dying for P. Henriot and P. Laval and other lords, just as a chicken has its throat slit to be served to these traitors for dinner. And I maintain, yes, I do, that the chicken is worth more than the people who will eat it. I know that I am more intelligent, superior, more valuable where goodness is concerned than those men. They are strong but their strength is temporary and an illusion. It will be drained from them by time, defeat, the hand of fate, illness (as was the case with Napoleon). And everyone will be dumbfounded. “But how?” people will say. “They were the ones we were afraid of!” I will truly have a communal spirit if I defend my share and everyone else’s share against their greed. The individual only has worth if he is sensitive to others, that goes without saying. But just so long as it is “all other men” and not “one man.” Dictatorship is built around this confusion. Napoleon said he only desired the greatness of France, but he proclaimed to Metternich,*11 “I don’t give a damn if millions of men live or die.”<br><br>
Hitler:<br><br>
FOR STORM IN JUNE:<br><br>
What I need to have:<br><br>
1                  An extremely detailed map of France or Michelin Guide<br><br>
2                  The complete collection of several French and foreign newspapers between 1 June and 1 July<br><br>
3                  A work on porcelain<br><br>
4                  June birds, their names and songs<br><br>
5                  A mystical book (belonging to the godfather) Father Bréchard<br><br>
Comments on what’s already been written:<br><br>
1                  Will—He talks for too long.<br><br>
2                  Death of the priest—schmaltzy.<br><br>
3                  Nimes? Why not Toulouse which I know?<br><br>
4                  In general, not enough simplicity!<br><br>
[In Russian, Irène Némirovsky added: “in general, they are often characters who have too high a social standing.”]<br><br>
April 1942. Need to have Storm, Dolce, Captivity follow on from one another. Replace the Desjours farm by the Mounain farm. I want to place it in Montferroux. Dual advantage: links Storm to Dolce and cuts out what is unpleasant in the Desjours household. I must create something great and stop wondering if there’s any point.<br><br>
Have no illusions: this is not for now. So mustn’t hold back, must strike with a vengeance wherever I want.<br><br>
For Captivity: the changing attitudes of Corte: national revolution, necessity of having a leader. Sacrifice (everyone agrees about the necessity of sacrifice just as long as it’s your neighbour’s), then the lapidary phrase*12 which makes him famous, for in the beginning Corte is rather frowned upon: he takes an attitude that is too French but he realises through subtle and menacing signs that this is not what he should do. Yes, he is patriotic but only afterwards: today the Rhine is flowing over the Ural mountains, he has a moment of hesitation but, after all, that is understandable given all the geographical fantasies which have become realities these past few years—the English border is at the Rhine and to top it all off the Maginot Line*13 and the Siegfried Line*14 are both in Russia, Horace’s final creation (down him*15).<br><br>
On L.:*16 It must be him because he is a crook. And in the  times we are living in, a crook is worth more than an honest man.<br><br>
<i>Captivity</i>—keep it simple. Tell what happens to people and that’s all.<br><br>
Today, 24 April, a little calm for the first time in a very long time, convince yourself that the sequences in Storm, if I may say so, must be, are a masterpiece. Work on it tirelessly.<br><br>
Corte is one of those writers whose usefulness will become glaringly obvious in the years following the defeat; he has no equal when it comes to finding euphemisms to guard against disagreeable realities. E.g.: the French army was not beaten back, it withdrew! If people kiss the Germans’ boots it is because they have a sense of reality. Having a communal spirit means hoarding food supplies for the exclusive use of the few.<br><br>
I think I should replace the strawberries with forget-me-nots. It seems impossible to bring cherry trees in blossom and ripe strawberries together in the same season.<br><br>
Find a way to link Lucile to Storm. When the Michauds stop to rest one night during their journey, this oasis and the breakfast and everything that must seem so wonderful—the porcelain cups, the dewy roses in thick bouquets on the table (roses with black centres), the coffee pot giving off bluish steam etc.<br><br>
Send up the so-called writers. E.g. A. C., the A. R. who wrote an article “Is the Tristesse d’Olympio*17 a masterpiece?” No one has ever sent up certain so-called writers like A. B. etc. (there is honour among thieves).<br><br>
To sum up, chapters already finished by 13 May 1942:<br><br>
(1) Arrival (2) Madeleine (3) Madeleine and her husband (4) vespers (5) the house (6) the Germans in the village (7) the private school (8) the garden and the Viscountess’s visit (9) the kitchen (10) departure of Mme Angellier. First look at the Perrins’ garden (11) the day it rains.<br><br>
TO DO:<br><br>
(12) the German ill (13) the Maie woods (14) the Perrin ladies (15) the Perrins’ garden (16) Madeleine’s family (17) the Viscountess and Benoît (18) the denunciation? (19) the night (20) the catastrophe at Benoît’s place (21) Madeleine at Lucile’s house (22) the celebration at the lake (23) the de[parture].<br><br>
Still to do: 12, half of 13, 16, 17, and the rest.<br><br>
Madeleine at Lucile’s house—Lucile in Mme Angellier’s room—Lucile and the German—celebration at the lake—the departure.<br><br>
FOR CAPTIVITY FOR THE CONCENTRATION CAMP THE BLASPHEMY OF THE BAPTISED JEWS “MAY GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE YOU YOURS”—Obviously, martyrs would not have said that.<br><br>
To do it well, need to make 5 parts:<br><br>
1 Storm<br><br>
2 Dolce<br><br>
3 Captivity<br><br>
4 Battles?<br><br>
5 Peace?<br><br>
General title: Storm or Storms and the first part could be called Shipwreck.<br><br>
In spite of everything, the thing that links all these people together is our times, solely our times. Is that really enough? I mean: is this link sufficiently felt?<br><br>
Therefore Benoît, after having killed (or trying to kill) Bonnet (for I still have to decide if it might not be better to let him live for the future), Benoît escapes; he first hides in the Maie woods, then, since Madeleine is afraid of being followed when she goes to bring him food, at Lucile’s house. Finally, in Paris, at the Michauds’ where Lucile sends him. Pursued, he escapes in time, but the Gestapo search the Michauds’ house, find notes made by Jean-Marie for a future book, think they are political tracts and arrest him. He meets Hubert there [in prison] who had got himself arrested for some stupidity or other. Hubert would have no trouble getting out, because his powerful family who are total collaborators can pull strings, but out of childishness, his taste for adventure stories etc., he prefers risking his life by escaping with Jean-Marie. Benoît and his friends help them. Later, much later, because in the meantime Jean-Marie and Lucile have to fall in love, they escape and flee France. That should end Captivity and as I’ve already said:<br><br>
<br><br>
—BenoîtCommunist<br><br>
—Jean-MarieMiddle class<br><br>
Jean-Marie dies heroically. But how? And what is heroism these days? Parallel to this death, must show the death of the German in Russia, the two full of sorrowful nobility.<br><br>
Adagio: Must rediscover all these musical terms (presto, prestissimo, adagio, andante, con amore, etc.)<br><br>
Music: Adagio from Op. 106, that immense poem of solitude—the twentieth variation on the theme of Diabelli, the sphinx with the dark eyebrows who contemplates the abyss—the Benedictus of the Missa Solemnis and the final scenes of Parsifal.<br><br>
He [Hubert] gets out: those who truly love each other are Lucile and Jean-Marie. What should I do with Hubert? Vague plan: Benoît escapes after killing Bonnet. He’s hidden at Lucile’s. After the Germans leave, Lucile is afraid to have him stay in the village and suddenly thinks of the Michauds.<br><br>
On the other hand, I want J. Marie and Hubert to be thrown in jail by the Germans for different reasons. That way it would be possible to have the German die afterwards. Lucile could think of going to him to save J. Marie? All this is very vague. Think about it.<br><br>
On the one hand, I would like a kind of general idea. On the other . . . Tolstoy, for example, with one idea spoils everything. Must have people, human reactions, and that’s all . . .<br><br>
Let’s make do with important businessmen and famous writers. After all, they are the real kings.<br><br>
For Dolce, a woman of honour can admit without shame “these unexpected emotions that reason can tame,” as Pauline would say (Corneille).<br><br>
2 June 1942. Never forget that the war will be over and that the entire historical side will fade away. Try to create as much as possible: things, debates . . . that will interest people in 1952 or 2052. Reread Tolstoy. Inimitable descriptions but not historical. Insist on that. For example in Dolce, the Germans in the village. In Captivity, Jacqueline’s First Communion and Arlette Corail’s party.<br><br>
2 June 1942. Starting to worry about the shape this novel will have when finished! Consider that I haven’t yet finished the second part, and I see the third? But that the fourth and fifth are in limbo and what limbo! It’s really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens. And the gods could find it amusing to wait a hundred or even a thousand years, as the saying goes*18: and I’ll be far away. But the gods wouldn’t do that to me. I’m also counting a lot on the prophecy of Nostradamus.<br><br>
1944—Oh, God!*19<br><br>
While waiting to see the shape . . . or rather I should say the rhythm: the rhythm in the cinematic sense . . . how the parts relate to each other. Storm, Dolce, gentleness and tragedy. Captivity? Something muffled, stifled, as vicious as possible. After that I don’t know.<br><br>
What’s important—the relationship between different parts of the work. If I had a better knowledge of music, I suppose that would help me. Since I  don’t know music, then what is called rhythm in films. All in all, make sure to have variety on one hand and harmony on the other. In the cinema, a film must have unity, tone, a style. E.g.: those street scenes in American films where you always have skyscrapers, where you can sense the hot, muffled, muggy atmosphere of New York. So unity for the film as a whole but variety between the parts. Pursuit—people in love—laughter, tears etc. It’s this type of rhythm I want to achieve.<br><br>
Now for a more basic question and one to which I cannot find an answer: won’t people forget the heroes from one book to the next? It is to avoid this problem that I would like to create one large volume of 1,000 pages rather than a work made up of several volumes.<br><br>
3 July 1942. Definitely,*20 unless things drag on and get worse as they go! But please let it be over one way or the other!<br><br>
Only need four movements. In the third, Captivity, collective destiny and personal destiny are strongly linked. In the fourth, whatever the result may be! (I UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN!), personal destiny is extricated from the other. On one side, the fate of the nation, on the other, Jean-Marie and Lucile, their love, the German’s music etc.<br><br>
Now, here is what I pictured:<br><br>
1                  Benoît is killed in a revolution or fight or an attempt at resisting, according to what seems realistic.<br><br>
2                  Corte. I think this might be good. Corte was very afraid of the Bolsheviks. He is extremely collaborationist but, following an attack on one of his friends or out of wounded pride, he gets the idea that the Germans are finished. He wants to commit himself to the extreme left! He first thinks of Jules Blanc, but after seeing him, he finds him [illegible word in Russian], he turns resolutely to a young activist group, that has formed . . . [unfinished sentence].<br><br>
For Captivity:<br><br>
Begin with: Corte, Jules Blanc visiting Corte.<br><br>
Then a contrast: Lucile perhaps at the Michauds’.<br><br>
Then: the Péricands.<br><br>
As many meetings as possible but not historical, rather the masses, social events or battles in the streets or something like that!<br><br>
Arrival<br><br>
Morning<br><br>
Departure<br><br>
These three episodes must be stressed even more. The movement of the masses must give the book its worth.<br><br>
In the fourth part, I only know the death of the German in Russia.<br><br>
Yes, to do it well, should have five parts of 200 pages each. A 1,000-page book. Ah, God!*21<br><br>
Remark. The theft of Corte’s dinner by the proletarians must have, for the future, a great influence. Normally, Corte should become extremely pro-Nazi, but I could also if I want, if I need to, do it in such a way that he says to himself: “There’s no point kidding myself; that’s where the future lies, the future belongs to this brutal force which stole my food from me. Two possible positions then: fight against it or, the opposite, from now on be a leader of the movement. Let himself be carried along by the wave, but on the front line? Even better, try to lead it? The official writer of the party. The great man of the Party, ha, ha, ha!” even more so since Germany is on good terms with the USSR and will come to tolerate it more and more. As long as the war lasts, this in fact will be madness on the part of Germany etc. Later on, it will be different . . . But later on people will see. They’ll fly to the aid of the strongest.<br><br>
Could someone like Corte have such cynical ideas? Of course, at certain times. When he’s been drinking or after making love his favourite way, a way that a mere mortal could barely begin to understand, and even if he did understand, it would cause only amazement and panic. The difficulty here is, as ever, the practical side of things. A newspaper, a kind of radio. Freedom, the Germans secretly paying him a subsidy.*22 We’ll see.<br><br>
All action is a battle, the only business is peace.*23<br><br>
The pattern, is it less*24 a wheel than a wave that rises and falls, and sometimes on its crest appears a seagull, sometimes the Spirit of Evil and sometimes a dead rat. Accurately reality, our reality (there’s nothing to be proud about there!).<br><br>
The rhythm must be here in the movements of the masses, everywhere where the crowds appear in the first volume, the exodus, the refugees, the arrival of the Germans in the village.<br><br>
In Dolce: the arrival of the Germans, but it must be re-examined, the morning, the departure. In Captivity, the First Communion, a demonstration (the one that happened on 11 November ’41), a fight? We’ll see. I haven’t got there yet and I’ll approach it realistically.<br><br>
If I show people who “influence” events, that would be unacceptable. If I show people act, that is certainly more realistic, but at the expense of keeping it interesting. Nevertheless, must limit myself to that.<br><br>
It’s quite fair (though banal, but let’s admire and embrace banality), what Percy says—that the historical scenes are the best (see War and Peace), the ones that are seen from the perspective of the characters. I tried to do the same thing in Storm, but in Dolce, everything to do with the Germans, all that can and must be separate.<br><br>
What would be good all in all (but is it doable?) is to always show the advance of the German army in the scenes not seen from the perspective of the characters. It would therefore be necessary to begin Storm with an image of people rushing around in France.<br><br>
Difficult.<br><br>
I think that what gives War and Peace the expansion Forster*25 talks about, is quite simply the fact that in Tolstoy’s mind, War and Peace is only the first volume that was to be followed by The Decembrists, but what he did unconsciously (perhaps, for naturally I really don’t know, I’m imagining), in the end what he did consciously or unconsciously is very important to do in a book like Storm etc., even if certain characters are wrapped up, the book itself must give the impression of only being one episode . . . which is really what is happening in our times, as in all times of course.<br><br>
22 June 1942. I discovered, a while ago, a technique that has been really useful to me—the indirect method. On absolutely every occasion when I encounter a problem in how to deal with something, this method saves me, gives freshness and strength to the entire story. I use it in Dolce every time Mme Angellier is in a scene. But this method of showing something that I haven’t used systematically is open to infinite development.<br><br>
1 July 1942. Find this for Captivity:<br><br>
By unifying, always simplifying the book (in its entirety) must result in a struggle between individual destiny and collective destiny. Must not take sides.<br><br>
My option: England’s style of government by the middle classes, unfortunately impossible, at least wishes to be revived, for in the end its essence is immutable; but it definitely will not happen until after I die: therefore left with two types of socialism. Neither of them appeals to me but there  are the facts!*26 One of them rejects me, therefore . . . the other . . . But that is out of the question. As a writer, I must state the problem correctly.<br><br>
The struggle between the two destinies, this happens each time there is an upheaval, it’s not logical; it’s instinctive; I think a good part of oneself dies when this happens, but not all of oneself. Salvation, in general, is when the time allocated to us is longer than the time allocated to a crisis. Contrary to what is believed, what is general passes, the whole remains, collective destiny is shorter than the destiny of the simple individual (that’s not exactly right. It’s a different timescale: we are only interested in the upheavals; the upheavals, either they kill us, or we last longer than them).<br><br>
To get back to my subject: At first, J. Marie has a thoughtful and detached attitude towards this great number of defeats. Naturally, he would like France to have its revenge but he realises that this is not a goal because whoever speaks of revenge speaks of hatred and vengeance, eternal war, and the Christian is upset by the idea of hell and eternal punishment; he is upset at this idea that there will always be someone stronger and someone weaker; he therefore looks to unification . . . What he desires, what he yearns for, is harmony and peace. And collaborationism as it is currently practised disgusts him, and on the other hand he sees communism, which suits Benoît but not him. Therefore he tries to live as if the great, urgent, collective question isn’t being asked, as if he only has to solve his own personal problems. But then he learns that Lucile has loved and perhaps still loves a German. He immediately takes sides, for the abstraction has suddenly been transformed into hatred. He hates a German and, because of him, through him, he hates or thinks he hates, which is the same thing, a way of thinking. In reality, what happens is that he forgets his own destiny and confuses it with someone else’s destiny. For practical purposes, by the end of Captivity, Lucile and J. Marie are in love with each other; this love is sad, unrequited, undeclared, completely conflicted! J. Marie runs away to fight the Germans—if that is still possible by the end of 1942!<br><br>
The fourth part must be the return, if not the triumph of the chapter when <br><br>
J. Marie appears. Never forget that the public likes having the life of the “wealthy” described to them.<br><br>
To sum up: struggle between personal destiny and collective destiny. To finish, stress Lucile and Jean-Marie’s love and stress eternal life. The German’s musical masterpiece. There must also be a reminder of Philippe. Which all in all would correspond to my deepest conviction. What lives on:<br><br>
1                  Our humble day-to-day lives<br><br>

Maie woods: 11 July 1942. The pine trees all around me. I am sitting on my blue cardigan in the middle of an ocean of leaves, wet and rotting from last night’s storm as if I were on a raft, my legs tucked under me! In my bag, I have put Volume II of Anna Karenina, the diary of K. M. and an orange. My friends the bumblebees, delightful insects, seem pleased with themselves and their buzzing is profound and grave. I like low, serious tones on voices and in nature. The shrill “chirp, chirp” of the small birds in the trees grates on me . . . In a moment or so I will try to find the hidden lake.<br><br>
Captivity:<br><br>
         1                  Corte’s reaction.<br><br>
         2                  Assassination attempt by Benoît’s friends which horrifies Corte.<br><br>
         3                  Corte learns something from the talkative Hubert . . .<br><br>
         4                  Through Arlette Corail etc.<br><br>
         5                  Her coquettish ways.<br><br>
         6                  Denunciation. Hubert and J. Marie are locked up with many others.<br><br>
         7                  Hubert, thanks to the actions of his rich and right-thinking family, is released, J. Marie is condemned to death?<br><br>
         8                  Here is where Lucile intervenes, the German. J. Marie is pardoned (compact description of the prison here or something of the sort).<br><br>
         9                  Benoît helps him escape. Sensational escape.<br><br>
10                  J. Marie’s reaction to Germany and the Germans.<br><br>
11                  He and Hubert flee to England.<br><br>
12                  Benoît’s death. Brutal and full of hope.<br><br>
Interspersed in all this must have Lucile’s love for Jean-Marie.<br><br>
The most important and most interesting thing here is the following: the historical, revolutionary facts etc. must be only lightly touched upon, while daily life, the emotional life and especially the comedy it provides must be described in detail.<br><br>

APPENDIX II<br><br>
Correspondence 1936–1945<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Albin Michel                                                                                                            7 October 1936<br><br>
Thank you for the cheque for 4,000 francs. Regarding this, may I please remind you of my visit to you last spring when I asked if it would be possible for you to work out some arrangement for the future, for you will understand that the situation has become very difficult for me now. You told me then that you would do your very best to comply and that I should put my trust in you. Up until now, you haven’t wanted to tell me how you proposed to arrange things, but you promised to make a decision within two months at the latest. You still haven’t written anything to me about this since our meeting, which was nearly four months ago. I am therefore asking what you intend to do, for alas you understand the necessities of life for someone who, like me, possesses no great wealth and only lives by my earnings as a writer.<br><br>
Editions Genio (Milan) to Albin Michel                                                                                                            10 October 1938<br><br>
We would be extremely grateful if you could tell us if Mme I. Némirovsky is of Jewish descent. According to Italian law, anyone who has one parent, either mother or father, of Aryan race, is not considered to be Jewish.<br><br>
Michel Epstein*1 to Albin Michel                                                                                                            28 August 1939<br><br>
My wife is currently in Hendaye (Villa Ene Exea, Hendaye-Plage) with the children. I am worried for her in these difficult times, for she has no one to come to her aid if she needs help. May I count on your friendship to send me, if you possibly can, a letter of recommendation she could eventually use for the authorities and the press in this area (Basses-Pyrénées, Landes, Gironde)?<br><br>
lbin Michel to Michel Epstein                                                                                       <br><br>
Epstein<br><br>
28 August 1939<br><br>
The name Irène Némirovsky should make it possible for her to open many doors! In spite of that, I would be more than pleased to give your wife a letter of introduction for the newspapers I know, but I will need certain details that you alone are in a position to provide. I would therefore ask you to please come and see me this evening.<br><br>
Robert Esménard*2 to Irène Némirovsky                                                                                                            28 September 1939<br><br>
We are currently living in terrifying times which could become tragic overnight. Moreover, you are Russian and Jewish, and it could be that people who do not know you—though they must be few and far between given your fame as a writer—might cause problems for you, also, as we must try to anticipate everything, I thought that my recommendation as an editor might be useful to you.<br><br>
I am therefore prepared to confirm that you are a writer of great talent, which is also obvious, moreover, by the success of your works both in France and abroad where some of your works have been translated. I am also happy to confirm that since October 1933, the year you came to me after having published some books with my colleague Grasset, including David Golder, which was a resounding success and gave rise to a remarkable film, since then, I have always had the most cordial of relations with both you and your husband, apart from our professional relationship.<br><br>

Temporary Travel Pass from 24 May to 23 August 1940<br><br>
(for Irène Némirovsky)<br><br>
Nationality: Russian<br><br>
Authorised to travel to Issy-l’Évêque<br><br>
Authorised mode of transport: train<br><br>
Purpose: to see her children who have been evacuated<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            12 July 1940<br><br>
It’s only been two days since the post is more or less back in service in the little village where I am. I am taking a chance and writing to your Paris address. I hope with all my heart that you have made it through these terrible times safe and sound and that you have no cause to worry about any of your family. As for me, even though military operations took place very close to here, we were spared. Currently my most serious concern is how to obtain some money.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Mlle Le Fur*3                                                                                                            9 August 1940<br><br>
I hope you have safely received my letter confirming receipt of the 9,000 francs. Here is why I am writing to you today. Just imagine that in a small local newspaper, I read the short announcement that I am sending you:<br><br>
Pursuant to a recent directive, no foreigners may contribute to the new newspaper.<br><br>
I would very much like to have the details of this directive and I thought you might be able to provide them for me.<br><br>
Do you think it applies to a foreigner who, like myself, has lived in France since 1920? Does it apply to political writers or to writers of fiction as well?<br><br>
In general, you know that I am completely isolated from society and am unaware of all the recently adopted directives regarding the press.<br><br>
If you think there is something that might be of interest to me, would you be so kind as to let me know. There’s also something else. I am again going to ask your help, as I recall how very kind and obliging you are. I would like to know which writers are in Paris and who is being published in the current newspapers. Could you find out if Gringoire and Candide,*4 as well as the bigger magazines, intend to return to Paris? And what about the publishing houses? Which ones are open?<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Mlle Le Fur                                                                                                            8 September 1940<br><br>
As far as I am concerned, there are persistent rumours here which lead me to believe that we might be part of the Free Zone one of these days and I wonder how I would then get my monthly payments.<br><br>
Law on Jewish Residents                                                                                                            4 October 1940*5<br><br>
From the date of the dissemination of this current law, foreign residents of Jewish descent may be interned in special camps by decision of the Préfet in the department where they reside.<br><br>
All residents of Jewish descent may at any time be forced to live in a specified location by decision of the Préfet in the department where they reside.*6<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Madeleine Cabour*7<br><br>
You now know all the problems I have had. What’s more, we have been living with a considerable number of these gentlemen for a few days now. This is painful for all sorts of reasons. I am therefore looking forward with great pleasure to the little village you’ve told me about, but may I ask you for some information.<br><br>
1                  How big is Jailly in terms of inhabitants and local retailers?<br><br>
2                  Is there a doctor and a pharmacist?<br><br>
3                  Is it being occupied?<br><br>
4                  Can you get any food, on the whole? Do you have butter and meat?<br><br>
This is particularly important to me now because of the children, as one of them has just had the operation you know about.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            10 May 1941<br><br>
Dear Monsieur, you will recall that, according to our agreement, I was meant to have 24,000 francs on 30 June. I do not need this money at the moment, but I admit that the recent laws regarding the Jews make me fear that difficulties might arise by the time this payment is made in six weeks’ time, and that would be disastrous for me. I must therefore appeal to your kindness and ask you to bring forward this payment by immediately giving a cheque in that amount to my brother-in-law, Paul Epstein, made payable to him. I have also asked him to telephone you to come to an arrangement about this. Of course, he will sign a receipt to release you fully from your responsibility towards me. It distresses me to have to trouble you yet again but I am sure you will understand the reasons for my concern. I hope you still have excellent news regarding A. Michel.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            17 May 1941<br><br>
Dear Monsieur Esménard, my brother-in-law told me that you gave him the 24,000 francs you were to send me on 30 June. Thank you so much for your extreme kindness towards me.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to the Sous-Préfet of Autun*8                                                                                                            2 September 1941<br><br>
I have received a letter from Paris informing me that anyone categorised as Jewish may not leave the village where he resides without permission from the authorities.<br><br>
I find myself in this situation, along with my wife, since, even though we are Catholics, we are of Jewish descent. I therefore am taking the liberty of requesting that you please authorise my wife, born Irène Némirovsky, as well as myself, to spend six weeks in Paris where we also have a home, 10 avenue Constant-Coquelin, for the period from 20 September to 5 November 1941.<br><br>
This request is made as my wife needs to sort out some business with her publisher, visit the ophthalmologist who has always treated her, as well as seeing the doctors who care for us, Professor Vallery-Radot and Professor Delafontaine. We intend to leave our two children, aged four and eleven, in Issy and, of course, we would like to be sure that there will be no problem returning to Issy, once we have attended to our affairs in Paris.<br><br>
Doctor in Issy: A. Bendit-Gonin.<br><br>
From the Progrès de l’Allier no. 200                                                                                                            8 August 1941<br><br>
SOVIET, LITHUANIAN, ESTONIAN AND LATVIAN RESIDENTS ORDERED TO REPORT TO REGIONAL GERMAN HEADQUARTERS<br><br>
Every male resident over the age of fifteen of Soviet, Lithuanian, Estonian or Latvian extraction, as well as those who are stateless but who previously held Soviet, Lithuanian, Estonian or Latvian citizenship, are ordered to report in person to their Regional German Headquarters with their identity papers no later than Saturday 9 August 1941 (noon). Anyone who does not report in person will be penalised according to the decree concerning this order.<br><br>

Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            9 September 1941<br><br>
I have finally rented the house I wanted here, which is comfortable and has a lovely garden. I am moving in on 11 November if these Gentlemen don’t get there first for we are once again expecting them.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            13 October 1941<br><br>
I was happy to receive your letter this morning, not just because it confirms my hope that you will do everything possible to help me, but also because it reassures me that someone is thinking about me, which is a great comfort.<br><br>
As you can imagine, life here is very sad, and if it weren’t for my work . . . Even the work becomes painful when the future is so uncertain . . .<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to André Sabatier*9                                                                                                            14 October 1941<br><br>
My dear friend, I was very touched by your kind letter. Please do not think that I underestimate either your friendship or M. Esménard’s; on the other hand, I perfectly understand the difficulties of the situation. Up until now, I have shown as much patience and courage as I could possibly muster. But, what can you do, there are moments which are very difficult. These are the facts: impossible to work and must be responsible for four people’s lives. Added to that are stupid humiliations—I cannot go to Paris; I cannot have even the most basic necessities sent here, such as blankets, beds for the children etc., my books. A general and absolute prohibition has been declared regarding the apartments inhabited by people like me. I’m not telling you this to make you feel sorry for me, but to explain to you why my thoughts can only be dark [. . .]<br><br>
Robert Esménard to Irène Némirovsky                                                                                                            27 October 1941<br><br>
I have explained your situation to my father-in-law and have also shown him the letters you recently sent me.<br><br>
As I have told you, A. Michel only wishes to be of service to you in any way possible and he has asked me to offer you a monthly payment of 3,000 francs for the year 1942 which is the same amount he was sending you when it was still possible to publish your works and sell them regularly. Please be so kind as to confirm your agreement.<br><br>
However, I must point out to you that in accordance with very precise instructions we received from the Syndicat des Éditeurs (Publishers’ Union) regarding the interpretation of directives included in the German Decree of 26 April, article 5, we find ourselves in the position of being required to send all royalties received from the sale of Jewish authors’ works to their “blocked account.” According to this principle, it is stated that “publishers must pay royalties to Jewish authors by sending them to their bank account after receiving confirmation from the bank that the account is blocked.”<br><br>
In addition, I am returning the letter you received from GIBE Films (a copy of which I have kept). According to information I received from a reliable source, a project of this type can only be undertaken if the author of the book to be adapted to the screen is of Aryan origin, both in this zone and the other.*10 I can therefore only be involved in such a project when the author whose work is to be made into a film provides me with the most formal guarantee on this point.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            30 October 1941<br><br>
I have just received your letter offering me a monthly payment of 3,000 francs for the year 1942. I greatly appreciate Monsieur Michel’s attitude towards me. I am truly most grateful both to him and to you; the faithful friendship you both have shown me is as precious to me as the material support you wish to give me by doing this. However, you know that if this money must be held in a blocked bank account, it would be of no use to me whatsoever.<br><br>
I wonder if under the circumstances, it would not be simpler to send the monthly payments to my friend, Mlle Dumot,*11 who lives with me and is the author of a novel entitled Les Biens de ce Monde*12 whose manuscript is with Monsieur Sabatier. [. . .]<br><br>
Mlle Dumot is definitely Aryan and can give you any proof of this you may require. I have known her since I was a child and if she could come to an agreement with you about the monthly payments, she would look after my interests. [. . .]<br><br>

Just received your telegram. Immediately making joint effort by Morand, Grasset, Albin Michel. Yours.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky’s final two letters:*14<br><br>
Toulon S/Arrox 13 July 1942—5 o’clock [written in pencil and legible]<br><br>
My dearest love, for the moment I am at the police station where I ate some blackcurrants and redcurrants while waiting for them  to come and get me. It is most important to stay calm, I believe it won’t be for very long. I thought we could also ask Caillaux and Father Dimnet for help. What do you think?<br><br>
I shower my darling daughters with kisses, tell Denise to be good and sensible . . . You are in my heart, as well as Babet, may the good Lord protect you. As for me, I feel calm and strong.<br><br>
If you can send me anything, I think my second pair of glasses are in the other suitcase (in the wallet). Books please, and also if possible a bit of salted butter. Goodbye my love!<br><br>
Thursday morning—July 1942 Pithiviers [written in pencil and legible]<br><br>
My dearest love, my cherished children, I think we are leaving today. Courage and hope. You are in my heart, my loved ones. May God help us all.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            14 July 1942<br><br>
I tried to reach you by telephone yesterday without success. I have sent both you and Monsieur Esménard a telegram. The police took my wife away yesterday. It appears she is going to the concentration camp in Pithiviers (Loiret).<br><br>
Reason: general order against stateless Jews between the ages of sixteen and forty-five. My wife is Catholic and our children are French. Can anything be done to help her?<br><br>
André Sabatier’s reply<br><br>
In any case will need several days. Yours Sabatier.<br><br>

Our author and friend I. Némirovsky has just been taken to Pithiviers from Issy-l’Évêque where she was living. Her husband has just informed me of this. A white Russian (Jewish as you know), never been involved in any political activities, a novelist of very great talent, having always paid the greatest tribute to her adopted country, mother of two little girls aged five and ten. I beg you to do everything you can. Thank you in advance and yours very truly.<br><br>

Lebrun*15 to Michel Epstein—Telegram                                                                                                            17 July 1942<br><br>
Pointless sending package as haven’t seen your wife.<br><br>
Telegram from Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            18 July 1942<br><br>
No news of my wife—Don’t know where she is—Try to find out and tell me truth by telegram—with advance notice can phone me day or night. ISSY-L’ÉVÊQUE.<br><br>
Telegram from Abraham Kalmanok*16 to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            20 July 1942<br><br>
Did you send Irène’s medical certificate—must do so immediately. Send telegram.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            22 July 1942<br><br>
I have received a letter from my wife, from the Pithiviers camp, dated last Thursday, telling me she would probably be leaving for an unknown destination, which I assume is far away. I have sent a telegram, and prepaid reply, to the commandant of the camp, but I have not heard from him. Would your friend possibly have more success, perhaps he could obtain the information they are refusing to give me? Thank you for everything you are doing. Keep me informed, I beg you, even if it’s bad news. Yours truly.<br><br>
Reply<br><br>
Have personally seen my friend.*17 Will do everything possible.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            Saturday 24 July 1942<br><br>
If I haven’t written to you it is because I have nothing precise to tell you at present and I can only bring myself to tell you the kind of things that might lessen your suffering. Everything necessary has been done. I saw my friend again who told me that all we can do now is wait. I pointed out, after receiving your first letter, that your children are French citizens, and after receiving the second letter, of [Irène’s] possible departure from the Loiret camp. I am waiting and this waiting, please believe me, is very painful to me as a friend . . . I say this to assure you that I am putting myself in your place! Let us hope that very soon I will have some definite good news to tell you. My heart goes out to you.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            26 July 1942<br><br>
Perhaps we should point out that in my wife’s case they are dealing with a White Russian who never wanted to accept Soviet citizenship, who fled Russia after a great deal of persecution, with her parents whose entire fortune was confiscated. I myself am also in the same position and I am not exaggerating when I calculate that about one hundred million pre-war francs were taken from my wife and myself in Russia. My father was President of the Syndicat des Banques Russes (Union of Russian Banks) and Executive Director of the Bank of Commerce of Azov-Don. The authorities concerned can therefore be assured that we haven’t the slightest sympathy for the current Russian regime. My younger brother, Paul, was a personal friend of the Grand Duke Dimitri of Russia and the Imperial Family living in France was often received by my father-in-law, in particular, Grand Duke Alexander and Grand Duke Boris. Moreover, I would point out to you, if I have not already done so, that the German non-commissioned officers who spent several months living with us, in Issy, left me the following document when they left:<br><br>
O.U. den I, VII, 41<br><br>
Kameraden. Wir haben längere Zeit mit der Familie Epstein zusammengelebt und diese sehr anständige und zuvorkommende Familie kennengelernt. Wir bitten Euch daher, sie damitsprechend zu behandeln. Heil Hitler!<br><br>
Hammberger, Feldw, 23599 A.*18<br><br>
I still don’t know where my wife is. The children are in good health, as for me, I am still standing.<br><br>
Thank you for everything, my dear friend. Perhaps it would be helpful if you could discuss all this with the Count de Chambrun*19 and Morand. Best wishes, Michel.<br><br>
? to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            27 July 1942<br><br>
Are there in your wife’s works, apart from the scene in Vin de Solitude, passages from novels, short stories or articles that could be pointed out as clearly anti-Soviet?<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            27 July 1942<br><br>
I received your letter of Saturday today. Thank you so very much for all your efforts. I know that you are doing and will do everything you can to help me. I have patience and courage. I just pray that my wife has the physical strength necessary to bear this blow! What is very difficult is that she must be horribly worried about the children and me, and I have no way of communicating with her since I don’t even know where she is.<br><br>
Please find enclosed a letter which I insist be sent to the German ambassador as a matter of URGENCY. If you could find anyone who could approach him personally and give it to him (Count de Chambrun perhaps, who, I believe, is prepared to take an interest in my wife), that would be perfect. But if you cannot find anyone able to do it QUICKLY, would you be so kind as to take it to the embassy or just post it. Thank you in advance. Of course, if this letter will upset the steps already taken, then tear it up, otherwise, I really wish it to be sent.<br><br>
I fear the same thing might happen to me. In order to avoid material concerns, could you send Mlle Dumot an advance on her monthly payments for ’43? I am afraid for the children.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to the German ambassador, Otto Abetz                                                                                                            27 July 1942<br><br>
I know that I am taking a great liberty in writing to you personally. Nevertheless, I am taking this step because I believe that you alone can save my wife, my only hope lies with you.<br><br>
Allow me therefore to explain to you the following: before leaving Issy, the German soldiers who were occupying the village gave me, in gratitude for the way we treated them, a letter which reads:<br><br>
O.U. den I, VII, 41<br><br>
Kameraden. Wir haben längere Zeit mit der Familie Epstein zusammengelebt und diese sehr anständige und zuvorkommende Familie kennengelernt. Wir bitten Euch daher, sie damitsprechend zu behandeln. Heil Hitler!<br><br>
Hammberger, Feldw. 23599 A.*20<br><br>
And yet, on the 13 July my wife was arrested. She was taken to the concentration camp at Pithiviers (Loiret) and, from there, sent somewhere else, but I do not know where. This arrest, I was told, was a result of general instructions given by the occupying authorities regarding the Jews.<br><br>
My wife, Madame M. Epstein, is a very famous novelist, I. Némirovsky. Her books have been translated in a great many countries and two of them at least—David Golder and Le Bal—in Germany. My wife was born in Kiev (Russia) on 11 February 1903. Her father was an important banker. My father was President of the Syndicat des Banques Russes (Union of Russian Banks) and Executive Director of the Bank of Commerce of Azov-Don. Both our families lost considerable fortunes in Russia; my own father was arrested by the Bolsheviks and imprisoned in the Saint-Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. We had the greatest of difficulty in finally managing to flee Russia in 1919 and we then took refuge in France, where we have lived ever since. All this must satisfy you that we feel nothing but hatred for the Bolshevik regime.<br><br>
In France, not a single member of our family has ever been involved in politics. I was a bank manager and as for my wife, she became a highly esteemed novelist. In none of her books (which moreover have not been banned by the occupying authorities) will you find a single word against Germany and, even though my wife is of Jewish descent, she does not speak of the Jews with any affection whatsover in her works. My wife’s grandparents, as well as my own, were Jewish; our parents practised no religion; as for us, we are Catholic and so are our children who were born in Paris and are French.<br><br>
If I may also take the liberty of pointing out to you that my wife has always avoided belonging to any political party, that she has never received special treatment from any government either left-wing or right-wing, and that the newspaper she contributed to as a novelist, Gringoire, whose director is H. de Carbuccia, has certainly never been well-disposed towards either the Jews or the Communists.<br><br>
Finally, for many years my wife has been suffering from chronic asthma (her doctor, Professor Vallery-Radot, can attest to this) and internment in a concentration camp would be fatal for her.<br><br>
I know, Ambassador, that you are one of the most eminent men in your country’s government. I am convinced you are also a just man. And it seems to me both unjust and illogical that the Germans should imprison a woman who, despite being of Jewish descent, has no sympathy whatsoever—all her books prove this—either for Judaism or the Bolshevik regime.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Count de Chambrun                                                                                                            28 July 1942<br><br>
I have received this very moment a letter from the husband of the author of David Golder, a copy of which I have taken the liberty of enclosing for you. This letter contains details which might prove useful. Let us hope that they will allow you to bring this matter to a positive conclusion. I thank you in advance for everything you are trying to do for our friend.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Mme Paul Morand*21                                                                                                            28 July 1942<br><br>
I wrote to Monsieur Epstein yesterday saying what we had agreed, thinking it would be better to write than to send a telegram. This morning I received his letter in the post. It clearly contains some interesting details.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            28 July 1942<br><br>
I hope you received the letter I wrote yesterday and that the one intended for the ambassador has been given to him, either by Chambrun or by someone else, or directly by you. Thank you in advance.<br><br>
In reply to your note of yesterday: I think that in David Golder, the chapter where David does a deal with the Bolsheviks to buy oil rights cannot be seen as very kindly towards them, but I don’t have a copy of D. Golder here, could you check? You have a copy of the manuscript of Les Échelles du Levant,*22 which appeared in Gringoire, and which is more savage towards the hero, a charlatan doctor who comes from the Levantine, but I can’t remember whether my wife specifically made him Jewish. I think so.<br><br>
I see in chapter XXV of her biography of Chekhov, the following sentence: “The short story ‘Ward 6’ contributed greatly to Chekhov’s fame in Russia; because of it, the USSR claimed him as their own and stated that, had he lived, he would have joined the Marxists. The posthumous fame of a writer is filled with such surprises . . .” Unfortunately, I can’t find anything else and this is very little.<br><br>
Is there really no way at all to find out from the French authorities whether or not my wife is still in the camp at Pithiviers? Ten days ago, I sent a telegram, with a prepaid reply, to the commandant of the camp and have had no reply. Is it possible that just knowing where she is would be forbidden?<br><br>
I was told that my brother Paul is in Drancy,*23 why am I not allowed to know where my wife is? Alas . . .<br><br>
Goodbye, dear friend. I don’t know why I have faith in my letter to the ambassador. Michel.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Mme Paul Morand                                                                                                            29 July 1942<br><br>
Here is the letter I told you about on the telephone. I think you are better placed than anyone to decide if it is best to send this letter to the person its author wants to have it. On the content, I can hardly comment, as for the details, it seems to me there are certain sentences which are rather unfortunate.<br><br>
Mavlik*24 to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            29 July 1942<br><br>
My dearest. I hope you have received my letters but I fear they may have been lost for I wrote to Julie and our aunt misunderstood her name on the telephone. My dearest, once again I beg you to stay strong for Irène, for the girls, for everyone else. We do not have the right to lose heart since we are believers. I was mad with grief but I am in control again, I spend all day long trying to find out some news and seeing people in the same situation. Germaine*25 got back the day before yesterday, she will be leaving for Pithiviers as soon as she has everything she needs. Since it seems that Sam is at Neaune-la-Rolande, near Pithiviers, she is desperate to try to get some news to both him and Irène. We’ve heard nothing except that Ania is at Drancy and she is asking for some clothes and books. There have been several letters from Drancy where people say they are being treated and fed properly. My darling, I beg of you, have courage. The money is late because the name was misunderstood. I’m going back to see Joséphine*26 tomorrow. Germaine saw the gentleman whose maid is at Pithiviers. I must also see Germaine before she leaves. She had a note from Sam but it was still from Drancy. I will write to you the day she leaves but I would like to hear from you, my dear. As for me, I don’t know how, but I’m still standing and still hoping. I send you and the girls my love always.<br><br>
Mme Rousseau (French Red Cross) to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            3 August 1942<br><br>
Dr. Bazy*27 left this morning for the Free Zone where he will spend a few days; he is going to look into the case of Mme Epstein once there and will do everything in his power to intervene on her behalf. As he didn’t have time to reply to you before leaving, he asked me to let you know he received your letter and that he will do everything possible to assist you.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to Mme Rousseau                                                                                                            6 August 1942<br><br>
I was happy to hear that Dr. Bazy is taking steps to help my wife. I wonder if it might not be a good opportunity to coordinate his efforts with those already taken by:<br><br>
1                  My wife’s publisher, Monsieur Albin Michel (the person who is dealing with this matter is Monsieur André Sabatier, one of the company directors).<br><br>
2                  Mme Paul Morand.<br><br>
3                  Henri de Régnier.<br><br>
4                  Count de Chambrun.<br><br>
Monsieur Sabatier will be receiving a copy of this letter and he can give you any information you might need (tel: DAN 87.45). It is particularly painful not knowing where my wife is (she was at the Pithiviers camp—Loiret, on 17 July and since then I haven’t had a single word from her). I would like her to know that the children and I have not been affected by recent directives and that we are all in good health. Could the Red Cross get the same message to her? Is it allowed to send parcels?<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            6 August 1942<br><br>
Enclosed is a copy of the letter I sent to the Red Cross. Still not a word from my wife. It’s hard. Was it possible to contact Ambassador Abetz and give him my letter? Michel.<br><br>
P.S. Could you send me the Count de Chambrun’s address?<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            9 August 1942<br><br>
I have just learned, from a very reliable source, that the women (and men and even the children) interned at the Pithiviers camp were taken to the German border and from there sent somewhere further east—probably Poland or Russia. This is supposed to have happened about three weeks ago.<br><br>
Up till now, I thought my wife was in some camp in France, in the custody of French soldiers. To learn she is in an uncivilised country, in conditions that are probably atrocious, without money or food and with people whose language she does not even know, is unbearable. It is now no longer a matter of getting her out of a camp sooner rather than later but of saving her life.<br><br>
You must have received the telegram I sent yesterday; I pointed out one of my wife’s books, Les Mouches d’Automne, first published by Kra, deluxe edition, and then by Grasset. This book is clearly anti-Bolshevik and I deeply regret not having thought of it sooner. I hope it is not too late to stress this new piece of evidence we have to the German authorities.<br><br>
I know, dear friend, that you are doing everything you can to save us, but I beg of you, find, think of something else, speak again to Morand, Chambrun, your friend and in particular to Dr. Bazy, President of the Red Cross, 12 rue Newton, tel: KLE 84.05 (the head of his section is Mme Rousseau, same address) pointing out the new evidence of Les Mouches d’Automne. It is absolutely inconceivable that we, who lost everything because of the Bolsheviks, should be condemned to death by those who are fighting them!<br><br>
Alas, my dear friend, I am launching one final appeal. I know that it is unforgivable to impose on you and the rest of our remaining friends this way but, I say it again, it is a question of life and death not only for my wife but also for our children, not to mention myself. The situation is serious. Alone here, with the little ones, virtually imprisoned since it is forbidden for me to move, I cannot even take solace in being able to act. I can no longer either sleep or eat, please accept that as an excuse for this incoherent letter.<br><br>
10 August 1942<br><br>
I, the undersigned, Count W. Kokovtzoff, former President of the Council of Ministers, Finance Minister of Russia, hereby certify that I knew the late Monsieur Efim Epstein, Administrator of the Bank of Russia, member of the Union of Banks that operated in Paris under my chairmanship, that he had the reputation of a banker of irreproachable integrity and that his actions and sympathies were clearly anti-communist.<br><br>
[sworn at the Police Station]<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            12 August 1942<br><br>
I received your telegram and letters. I am replying before leaving Paris for the suburbs for a few weeks. If you need to write to me between 15 August and 15 September, send it to the [publishing] house where it will be dealt with immediately, they will do whatever is necessary if they can and keep me up to date. Here is what I’ve done: many initiatives without much success as yet:<br><br>
(1) No reply from the Count de Chambrun to whom I have written. Since I don’t know him, I can’t chase him up, as I don’t know whether his silence is a sign that he doesn’t wish to get involved. His address is 6 bis, place du Palais-Bourbon, VII.<br><br>
(2) On the other hand, Mme P. Morand is displaying tireless devotion. She is increasing her attempts, she has your letter and its essence will be sent very soon, along with a medical certificate, by one of her friends who is also at the embassy. Les Mouches d’Automne, which she read, does not seem to her to be at all what she was looking for: anti-revolutionary, of course, but not anti-Bolshevik. She suggests that you do not take any unsystematic and pointless initiatives, as she sees it. The only door you should be knocking on, again according to her, is the Jewish Union who alone, through its network, could tell you where your wife is and perhaps get news to her about the children. Here is her address: 29 rue de la Bienfaisance, VIII.<br><br>
(3) My friend told me straight out that his attempts led him to conclude there was nothing he could do.<br><br>
(4) Same reply, just as categorical, from my father, after approaching the French regional authorities.<br><br>
(5) I asked a friend to contact the author of Dieu est-il français? (Friedrich Sieburg) who promised to see [what could be done], not to have her released, which seemed doubtful to him, but at least to have some news of her.<br><br>
(6) Yesterday, I telephoned the Red Cross where I spoke to Mme Rousseau’s stand-in, who was very kind and knew all about the matter. Dr. Bazy is currently in the Free Zone and is making enquiries in high places regarding what might be possible. He is due back on Thursday, so I’ll phone him before I leave.<br><br>
My personal feelings are as follows:<br><br>
(1) The directive which affected your wife is part of a general order (here, in Paris alone, it seems to have affected several thousand stateless people), which partly explains why we seem to be incapable of obtaining an order for special treatment, but which also means we can hope that nothing special might happen to your wife.<br><br>
(2) This directive was ordered by certain German authorities who have total control in this area and in the face of whom the French authorities and other German civil or military authorities, even those in high places, seem to have no influence.<br><br>
(3) Leaving for Germany seems probable, not to go to the camps according to Mme P. Morand, but to go to Polish cities where stateless people are all being held.<br><br>
All this is very hard, I feel it only too well, dear Monsieur. You must try only to think of the children and remain strong for them, easy advice to give . . . I’m sure you’ll say. Alas! I have done everything I can. Your very faithful André.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to Mme Cabour                                                                                                            14 August 1942<br><br>
Sadly Irène has gone—where? I do not know. You can imagine how worried I am! She was taken away on 13 July and I have had no word of her since. I am alone here with the two little girls who are being looked after by Julie. Perhaps you remember having met her at avenue Président-Wilson. If I ever receive any news of Irène, I will let you know immediately. You wish to help us, dear Madame. I will take advantage of this offer without even knowing if what I ask is in the realm of possibility. Could you get us some thread and cotton wool as well as some typewriter paper? We would be extremely grateful to you.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky died at Auschwitz on 17 August 1942, a fact which makes the correspondence that follows this date even more poignant. (Translator)<br><br>
Michel Epstein to Mme Cabour                                                                                                            20 August 1942<br><br>
Irène was taken away on 13 July by the French police, acting on orders from the German police, and taken to Pithiviers—because she was a stateless person of Jewish descent, without taking into account the fact that she is Catholic, her children are French and that she took refuge in France to escape the Bolsheviks, who also stole her parents’ entire fortune. She arrived at Pithiviers on 15 July and, according to the only letter I received from her, she was due to leave again on the 17th for an unknown destination. Since then, nothing. Not a word, I don’t know where she is or even if she is alive. Since I do not have the right to leave this place, I have asked various people to intervene, without success as yet. If there is anything at all you can do, I beg you to do it, for this suffering is unbearable. Imagine that I can’t even send her any food, that she has no clothes or money . . . Up until now, I’ve been left here for I am over forty-five . . .<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            15 September 1942<br><br>
Still no sign of life from Irène. As Mme Paul*28 advised, I have taken no new initiatives. I am counting on her alone. I don’t think I can bear this uncertainty for long. You said you were waiting for some news from Dr. Bazy. I assume you haven’t had any? I hope the Red Cross can at least make sure that Irène gets some clothing, money and food before winter sets in.<br><br>
If you see Mme Paul, would you please be so kind as to tell her I have received a card from His Grace Ghika*29 who, six months ago, was still in good health in Bucharest.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            17 September 1942<br><br>
I telephoned Mme Paul as soon as I got back. I expressed your gratitude to her and told her you had taken her advice. All the steps she has taken, even those with the person to whom you have written a letter, still have not yielded any results. She told me: “It’s like banging your head against a wall.” Mme Paul thinks that the wise thing to do is to wait until these great movements of populations are somehow contained and stabilised.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            19 September 1942<br><br>
Our letters have crossed. I thank you for giving me some news, no matter how depressing it may be. Could you please find out if it would be possible for me to be exchanged for my wife—I would perhaps be more useful in her place and she would be better off here. If this is impossible, maybe I could be taken to her—we would be better off together. Obviously, it would be necessary to speak to you about all this in person.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            23 September 1942<br><br>
Ever since the 14 July I told myself that if a trip to Issy were necessary, I wouldn’t hesitate to go. I do not think that, even now, this could lead to any definite viable decision. Here is why.<br><br>
To exchange places is currently impossible. It would only mean one more inmate, even though the reason you give for it is obviously well-founded. Once we know exactly where Irène is, that is to say once all this is “organised,” then and then alone, it might be possible to make this proposal.<br><br>
Together, in the same camp! Another impossibility, as separation between men and women is strict and absolute.<br><br>
The Red Cross has just sent me a telegram this morning asking for a detail that I do not know and that I am in turn asking you for in a telegram. I will send it immediately. Let us hope we are on the way to having some news.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier                                                                                                            29 September 1942<br><br>
I promised I would be asking for your help and I am keeping my promise. This is what I need. My Alien Identity Card, valid until next November, has to be renewed. This depends on the Préfet of the Saône-et-Loire, Mâcon, and I must send him a renewal request soon. I do not wish this request to cause us any new problems. I am therefore asking if you could approach the Préfet of Mâcon. Everything is perfectly in order, but the scarcely propitious circumstances for people in my category lead me to fear problems from the Ministry of Justice etc. May I count on you? I will do nothing until I hear from you but the matter is pressing.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            5 October 1942<br><br>
I have just received your letter of the 29th. I read it and had someone else read it. There is no doubt, my response is clear: stay where you are, doing anything at all seems to me extremely foolhardy. I am expecting Dimnet to come and see me and will be happy to discuss it with him.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Michel Epstein                                                                                                            12 October 1942<br><br>
This morning, I received your letter of the 8th as well as a copy of the letter you sent to Dijon. I am writing to tell you the following:<br><br>
Our friend also had everything perfectly in order but you must realise that didn’t prevent anything from happening.<br><br>
As for the children, they are French and, to use your own expression, I do not get the impression that a change of scene is essential, but that is only my opinion. It seems to me that the Red Cross would be best placed to give you more detailed and concrete information.<br><br>
Michel Epstein to André Sabatier (Creusot Prison)                                                                                                            19 October 1942<br><br>
[letter written in pencil]<br><br>
I am still at Creusot, being treated very well and in perfect health. I do not know when we will continue our journey or where we are going. I am counting on your friendship towards my family. They will need it. I am certain you will look after them. Apart from that, there is nothing I can tell you except that I am keeping faith and I bid you farewell.<br><br>
Michel was first imprisoned at Creusot, then taken to Drancy. On 6 November 1942 he was deported to Auschwitz and sent immediately to the gas chamber. There is then a two-year gap in the correspondence. (Translator)<br><br>
Julie Dumot to Robert Esménard                                                                                                            1 October 1944<br><br>
I am writing to ask you to continue sending the monthly payments. You know that I have had many worries. For seven months I have had to keep hiding them in different places. I hope this nightmare is now over. I have gone to get the children to put them into boarding school. My eldest girl is in the third year of secondary school,*30 they are happy finally to be free for Denise will be able to do her schoolwork more calmly as her future is also at stake.<br><br>
Julie Dumot to André Sabatier                                                                                                            10 October 1944<br><br>
I have received the 15,000 francs. I have been worried about my children since last February. I had to hide them again. That is certainly the reason why Sister Saint-Gabriel did not reply to you. They couldn’t go to school for seven months. I hope we will be more settled now and that they will work hard. I have put them back in boarding school. Denise is in the third year of secondary school and Babet in the fourth year of primary school.*31 They are very happy to see their friends again and the good Sisters who helped me so much in our time of need. I hope that now nothing else will happen to torture us while we wait for the return of our family in exile. Is it possible to sell any author’s work now or are sales still being regulated?<br><br>
Robert Esménard to Julie Dumot                                                                                                            30 October 1944<br><br>
Thank you for your letter of 1 October. I can see that you have had to suffer through many cruel days of anguish. Now you can finally put your mind at rest regarding the girls’ future who will be able to pursue their studies in peace; we can only hope that this terrifying nightmare will soon come to an end and that in the very near future you will receive some word of their parents. This is, as you know, one of my dearest wishes . . .<br><br>
André Sabatier to Julie Dumot                                                                                                            9 November 1944<br><br>
I read with great trepidation the fears you recently had regarding your children. I can only rejoice now in knowing that you are safe from all the measures of the type to which you allude. All we can do now is pray for the swift return of those who have been taken from us.<br><br>
Monsieur Esménard has, of course, given the necessary instructions for the remaining copies of Mme I. Némirovsky’s works to be sold. As for me, I have been wondering if now would be the time to publish the two manuscripts of hers that I have, her novel Les Biens de ce Monde and her biography of Chekhov. Like myself, Monsieur Esménard considers it would be preferable to postpone such publication, for it would perhaps be dangerous to attract attention to her at a time when her situation does not protect her from potentially dreadful reprisals.<br><br>
Robert Esménard to Julie Dumot                                                                                                            27 December 1944<br><br>
May 1945 finally bring us peace and the return of your dear absent family.<br><br>

Reply of Robert Esménard to R. Adler                                                                                                            8 January 1945<br><br>
We received the card dated 13 October 1944 addressed to Mme Némirovsky, but alas! we have not been able to forward it to her. In fact, Mme Némirovsky was arrested on 13 July 1942 at Issy where she had been living since 1940 and taken to the concentration camp at Pithiviers, then deported the same month. Her husband was arrested a few weeks later and also deported. All attempts to intervene on their behalf were futile and no one has heard from either of them since. Fortunately, their two little girls were saved thanks to a loyal friend with whom they are living in the provinces. Please believe that we deeply regret having to be the bearer of such news.<br><br>
Reply of Albin Michel to A. Shal                                                                                                            16 January 1945<br><br>
Thank you for your card dated 6 November 1944 addressed to Mme Némirovsky. Alas! it will be impossible for us to forward this card to her for our author and friend was taken away in 1942 and marched to some camp or other in Poland. Since then, in spite of many various efforts, we have never been able to learn anything. Her husband had the same fate a few months after his wife. As for the children they were fortunately entrusted to friends of the family in time and are currently doing well. I deeply regret having to be the bearer of such sad news. Let us not lose hope . . .<br><br>

(Found[ation] for the relief of men of letters and scientists of Russia—New York)<br><br>
We have just learned the tragic news regarding Irène Némirovsky from Madame Raïssa Adler. Madame Adler has also told us that her two daughters were saved by one of their grandfather’s former companions. This woman, Mlle Dumot, we understand, is a completely trustworthy person, but unfortunately is lacking in financial means and cannot, therefore, take responsibility for their education.<br><br>
The friends and admirers of Mme Némirovsky in New York met to discuss how we might be able to help the children. But they are neither numerous nor rich here. As for our committee, today we number about one hundred men of letters and scientists. We have been unable to do enough. This is why we are contacting you, dear Monsieur, to find out if Mme Némirovsky has any funds with her French publishers from royalties and if so, to see if it would be possible for you and your colleagues to place a portion of these fees at the disposal of the two children. We will send you their address.<br><br>
Robert Esménard to Marc Aldanov                                                                                                            11 May 1945<br><br>
Mme Némirovsky was, alas! arrested on 13 July 1942, taken to the concentration camp at Pithiviers, then deported. Her husband, a few weeks later, met the same fate. We have never heard from them again and we are terribly worried about them.<br><br>
I know that Mlle Dumot, who saved the two little girls, is raising them perfectly well. In order for her to do so, I must tell you that since Irène Némirovsky’s arrest, I have sent Mlle Dumot large sums of money which come to nearly 151,000 francs and that we are continuing to provide her with a monthly payment of 3,000 francs.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Julie Dumot                                                                                                            1 June 1945<br><br>
I have been thinking of you and your children often since the camp survivors and prisoners have begun to return to France. I am assuming that for the moment you haven’t heard anything or you certainly would have let me know. As for me, I have been unable to find out anything at all. I asked Mme J. J. Bernard*32 who knew Mme Némirovsky and who is currently with the Red Cross trying to take the necessary steps to find something out. Naturally, if I hear anything at all, you will be the first to know. There is one question I wanted to ask you: what happened to the manuscripts that were at Issy when Mme Némirovsky was arrested? I heard that there was a long novella she’d finished. Would you happen to have the text? If so, could you send it to me so we could possibly publish it in our journal La Nef.<br><br>
André Sabatier to Father Englebert                                                                                                            16 July 1945<br><br>
My reason for writing to you will come as a surprise. Here is what it is about: you will surely know I. Némirovsky by name and reputation, one of our greatest novelists of France in the years preceding the war. Jewish and Russian, I. Némirovsky was deported in 1942, as was her husband, and undoubtedly sent to a concentration camp in Poland; we have never been able to learn anything more. Even today, there is total silence and we have, alas! lost any hope of finding her alive.<br><br>
I. Némirovsky left her two little girls, Denise and Elisabeth Epstein, in France in the care of a friend. I have just seen the woman who has looked after them; she told me that she had managed to get the girls accepted as boarding students with the Dames de Sion [Sisters of Zion]. It was all agreed when, at the last minute, the Mother Superior changed her mind, on the pretext that there were not enough places, which was both a disappointment and a terrible problem for the good woman who is looking after these two little girls. Would it be possible for you to find out exactly what is going on? And if you have influence with these Sisters, could you use it to ensure that Denise and Elisabeth be admitted to the Dames de Sion for the beginning of the school year in October at the latest.<br><br>
We care a great deal about these two little girls, as you can understand; whatever happens, even if you can do nothing, thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.<br><br>

Omer Englebert to André Sabatier                                                                                                            7 August 1945<br><br>
I am pleased to inform you that the Russian Jewish novelist (I can’t recall her name!) whose daughters you wanted to help and whom Monsieur Sabatier recommended to me on your behalf, have been accepted at the Dames de Sion, in Grandbourg near Evry-Petit-Bourg. The Mother Superior has just told me that they can attend at the beginning of the coming academic year.<br><br>
Julie Dumot (46 rue Pasteur, Marmande) to A. Sabatier                                                                                                            29 August 1945<br><br>
I do not know how to thank you for your extreme loyalty. I am very happy for the children, especially for Babet who is only eight years old and has her entire education ahead of her. As for Denise, who is doing very well now, she can improve herself in this first-class establishment, as her mother wished. This is why I am so very grateful to you, for having made their parents’ wishes come true. If Denise cannot continue her studies, she must have her Certificate of General Education to be able to work, we’ll find out about that in a few days. Your kind letter reached me here where I have brought the children for their holidays. Denise is completely cured. She had an X-ray which showed that all signs of the pleurisy had disappeared. As for Babet, she is going to have her tonsils and adenoids out next week. I couldn’t have it done sooner, as the doctor is on holiday, which means I’ll get back to Paris a week later than expected.<br><br>
Yes, Monsieur Sabatier, there was the possibility of the Société des Gens de Letters (Society of Men of Letters) doing something for the children. Monsieur Dreyfus, to whom I explained my situation, saying that I couldn’t manage with my 3,000 francs per month, that Denise had been under medical care for six months, took the matter to his friend, Monsieur Robert, asking for something to be done for the children. The very same day, I informed Monsieur Esménard, who knows all about it. If you need any information about me, Tristan Bernard has known me since I was sixteen.<br><br>

12,000 francs: Sept-Oct-Nov-Dec 1945                                                                          <br><br>
Robert Esménard (note for Mlle Le Fur)                                                                                                            7 December 1945<br><br>
Friday afternoon, I went to see Mme Simone Saint-Clair who is a member of a committee whose purpose is to come to the aid of I. Némirovsky’s children. Certain individuals and groups are going to deposit a monthly amount to a notary who has been appointed to retain the money until, in theory, they have finished sitting the exams for their baccalaureat. Once Denise, the eldest, has passed it, I assume this matter will be reviewed.<br><br>
Apart from that, these gifts will be received in such a way as to constitute a capital sum for I. Némirovsky’s daughters, which they may use however they wish when they are no longer minors. There is already a certain sum, which includes a payment by the Banque des Pays du Nord where M. Epstein was employed, something in the region of 18,000 francs, corresponding to 3,000 francs a month with a certain number of back payments.<br><br>
Mlle Dumot will have at her disposal, through the auspices of the notary, X amount to reimburse her for her expenses, then each month an amount to be decided. As for our firm, I have said that from the date of our last monthly payment—the sum of 2,000 francs per month will be paid, without, of course, this amount being deducted from I. Némirovsky’s royalties. In addition, I shall allocate the sum of 2,000 francs per month from Mme Némirovsky’s royalties, dating from the month when I began sending these monthly payments, in other words, these monthly payments will be calculated retrospectively from the date of the first payment.<br><br>
Widespread announcements will be made in the press to raise money.<br><br>
W. Tideman to Irène Némirovsky                                                                                                            7 December 1945<br><br>
I am a journalist working for a newspaper in Leyden (Holland) for whom I have offered to translate a novel or short story from French, in instalments. They have just informed me that they agree in principle to publish whatever I suggest or send them. I explained to them that there would be royalties to pay, which would undoubtedly be much greater for a novel already published here, as the publishers would claim their share, than for a new, unpublished short story, for which they would only have to deal with the author. And I thought of you even though I am only familiar with your novels.<br><br>
Albin Michel’s reply to W. Tideman                                                                                                            29 December 1945<br><br>
I have seen the letter sent to my offices addressed to I. Némirovsky and am alas! unable to pass it on to her.<br><br>
Mme I. Némirovsky was, in fact, arrested in July 1942 then deported to Poland, we think. Since the date of her arrest, no one has heard anything from her.<br><br>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br><br>
My thanks go to Olivier Rubinstein and everyone at Éditions Denoël who welcomed this manuscript with enthusiasm and emotion; to Francis Esménard, President and General Director of Albin Michel, who showed great generosity in allowing the publication of a piece of the past of which he was the guardian; to Myriam Anissimov, the link between Romain Gary, Olivier Rubinstein and Irène Némirovsky; and to Jean-Luc Pidoux-Payot, who helped read the manuscript and gave me his valuable advice. —DENISE EPSTEIN<br><br>
<br><br>
Preface to the French Edition*1<br><br>
In 1929 the French publisher Bernard Grasset was so enthusiastic about a manuscript he had received in the post that he immediately decided to publish it. It was only as he was about to send a contract to the author of the novel, entitled David Golder, that he realised no name or address had been given—just a post office box number. He put an advertisement in the newspapers asking the mysterious author to make contact.<br><br>
When Irène Némirovsky arrived to meet him a few days later, Bernard Grasset was astonished: how could this fashionable, cheerful young Russian woman, who had lived in France for only ten years, have written a book that was so brilliantly daring, cruel, and mature? He questioned her carefully to make sure she wasn’t standing in for a famous author who wished to remain anonymous, but as he did so his admiration grew. Her French was impeccable (although born in Kiev, she had learned it from her governess); as well as Russian, she knew Polish, Basque, English, Finnish and a little Yiddish (a language she would make use of in her novel Les Chiens et les Loups, published in 1940).<br><br>
David Golder was an overnight success, unanimously acclaimed by the critics and admired by other writers. However, the twenty-six-year-old Irène Némirovsky refused to be carried away by her sensational entry into the literary world. She was surprised that so much fuss was made over David Golder, which she considered, without false modesty, a “minor novel.” On 22 January 1930 she wrote to a friend, “How could you think I could possibly forget my old friends because of a little book which people have been talking about for a few weeks and which will be forgotten just as quickly, just as everything is forgotten in Paris?”<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky was born 1903 in Kiev, then part of the area known as Yiddishland to which Russian Jews were confined. Her father’s family came from the Ukrainian city of Nemirov, which had been an important centre of the Hassidic movement in the eighteenth century. Léon Némirovsky had the misfortune to be born in 1868 in Elisabethgrad, the city where the great waves of pogroms against the Jews began in 1881. However, his family had prospered, becoming wealthy by trading in grain. As a young man Léon had travelled widely before making his fortune in finance, going on to become one of the richest bankers in Russia. His business cards read, “Léon Némirovsky, President and Managing Director of the Bank of Commerce of Vorononej, Administrator of the Union Bank of Moscow, Member of the Private Commercial Banking Committee of Petrograd.” He bought an enormous private house overlooking St. Petersburg, on a quiet street lined with gardens and lime trees.<br><br>
Irène was not a happy child. Her mother, who liked to be called Fanny (after her Hebrew name, Faïga), saw the birth of her daughter as the first sign of her declining youth and beauty. She felt a kind of aversion to Irène, for whom she never showed the least sign of love, and would spend hours in front of the mirror pampering herself, or away from home in search of extramarital affairs. She could not bear the idea that her looks would fade, or that she might turn into the kind of older woman who kept young men. She forced Irène to dress like a schoolgirl well into her teens in order to convince herself that she wasn’t growing older.<br><br>
Léon, whom Irène adored and admired, was always busy with his work and most of the time was away, or betting large sums of money at the casino. A lonely, solitary child, entrusted to the care of her governess, Irène took refuge in books, and fought off despair by developing a ferocious hatred of her mother. This violent and unnatural relationship between mother and daughter would be at the heart of many of her novels, as would her disdain for her mother’s wealthy Jewish milieu.<br><br>
In Russia the Némirovskys led a life of luxury. Every summer they would leave the Ukraine for the Crimean coast, Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Hendaye or the French Riviera. Irène’s mother would take up residence in a villa, while Irène and her governess were sent to lodge with a family. At fourteen, after the death of her French teacher, Irène began writing. Settled on the sofa, a notebook on her lap, she developed a technique inspired by Ivan Turgenev. As well as the narrative itself, she would write down all the ideas the story inspired in her, without any revision or crossing out. She filled notebook upon notebook with thoughts about her characters, even the minor ones, describing their appearance, their education, their childhood, all the stages of their lives in chronological order. When each character had been detailed to this degree of precision, she would use two pencils, one red, the other blue, to underline the essential characteristics to be retained; sometimes only a few lines. She would then move quickly on to writing the novel, improving it, then editing the final version.<br><br>
In 1917, the Némirovskys were still living in the large, beautiful house in St. Petersburg they had occupied since 1914. Némirovsky described the house in her autobiographical novel Le Vin de solitude: “The apartment . . . was built in such a way that from the entrance hall, you could see all the way back to the other rooms—a series of white and gold reception rooms that were visible through the large, open doors.” For a number of Russian writers and poets, St. Petersburg is a mythical city; to Irène Némirovsky it was nothing more than a collection of dark, snow-covered streets, swept by the icy wind that rose from the disgusting, polluted canals of the Neva. When the October Revolution broke out, Léon Némirovsky thought it expedient to move his family to Moscow since he frequently went there on business and had sub-let an apartment from an officer of the Imperial Guard who had been assigned to the Russian embassy in London. His plan proved misguided. Moscow was where the more violent fighting took place and the family were trapped in the apartment for five days, their only food a bag of potatoes, some chocolate and sardines. Wedged in between other apartment blocks and surrounded by a courtyard, the house was hidden from the street. While battles raged outside, Irène explored the officer’s library. There she discovered Huysmans, de Maupassant, Plato and Oscar Wilde (The Portrait of Dorian Gray was her favourite book). When the street was deserted she would quietly go down to pick up the empty cartridges.<br><br>
During a lull in the fighting, the Némirovskys went back to St. Petersburg, but the Bolsheviks had put a price on Léon’s head and he was forced into hiding. In December 1917, taking advantage of the fact that the borders had not yet been closed, Léon Némirovsky made arrangements for his family to travel to Finland, disguised as peasants. Irène spent a year in a little hamlet consisting of three wooden houses in the middle of a snowfield. She still hoped to return to Russia and the wait seemed long. While they were there, her father returned to Russia several times in disguise to try and rescue their belongings. Yet despite the uncertainty and lack of comfort, Némirovsky experienced for the first time a period of serenity and peace. She was absorbed by her writing, composing prose poems inspired by Oscar Wilde.<br><br>
With the situation in Russia deteriorating and the Bolsheviks drawing dangerously nearer to them, the Némirovskys moved on to Sweden, finally reaching Stockholm after a long journey. They spent three months in the Swedish capital, where Irène would always remember the mauve lilacs growing in the courtyards and gardens. Then, in early 1919, the family took a small cargo boat for France, sailing for ten days through a terrible storm, which inspired the dramatic final scene in David Golder. Safe in Paris, Léon Némirovsky took over as director of a branch of his bank and so managed to rebuild his fortune.<br><br>
Irène had always loved France and, in Paris, her life changed utterly. She enrolled at the Sorbonne, where she graduated with a distinction in literature, and began sending stories to magazines. In 1927 she published a novella called L’Enfant génial, about a young Jewish boy from the slums of Odessa who seduces an aristocrat with his poetry.<br><br>
The Némirovskys were soon assimilated into French society and led the glamorous life of the wealthy upper-middle class: fashionable soirées, champagne dinners, balls, luxurious holidays. Irène adored dancing. She dashed between parties, living, as she herself admitted, “the high life.” Sometimes she gambled at the casino. On 2 January 1924 she wrote to a friend, “I have had the wildest week: one ball after another, and I’m still a bit heady and finding it difficult to get back into the routine of work . . .” Another time she wrote from Nice, “I’m behaving like a madwoman, it’s shameful. I dance all night long. Every evening there are very chic entertainments in different hotels, and as my lucky star has blessed me with a few handsome young men, I’m enjoying myself very much indeed.” A further letter, written just after a return from Nice, reads: “I haven’t  behaved very well . . . for change . . . The evening before I left, there was a grand ball at our hotel, the Negresco. I danced like a mad thing until 2 a.m. and went outside in the freezing cold to drink champagne and flirt.” A few days later she wrote: “Choura came to see me and lectured me for two hours: it seems that I flirt too much, that it’s bad to upset boys like that . . . I broke off with Henry, you know, and he came to see me the other day looking pale, wide-eyed and evil, with a revolver in his pocket!”<br><br>
In the whirlwind of one of these parties she met Mikhaïl—Michel Epstein—“a small dark-haired man with a very swarthy complexion,” who wasted no time in courting her. He had a degree in Physical and Electronic Engineering from the University of St. Petersburg, and worked as a senior banking executive at the Banque des Pays du Nord, Rue Gaillon. She liked him, flirted and, in 1926, they were married. They moved to 10 avenue Constant-Coquelin, a beautiful apartment on the Left Bank, whose windows looked out over the large courtyard of a convent. In 1929 Irène gave birth to Denise (Fanny sent a teddy bear). By the time her second daughter, Elisabeth, was born in 1937, David Golder had been turned into a film, and she had published nine novels. She and Michel moved in high circles and took holidays in fashionable spa towns for Irène’s asthma.<br><br>
In spite of her fame, and though clearly very attached to her new country, Irène still didn’t have French citizenship. In 1939 Irène decided that she and her children should convert to Catholicism. This decision should be seen in the context of the obsessive fear of war in 1939, and the previous decade of violent anti-Semitism during which Jews had been portrayed as evil invaders and power-hungry warmongers—a race of bourgeois merchants and revolutionaries. She and her family were baptised early in the morning of 2 February 1939 in the Chapel of Sainte-Marie in Paris, by a family friend, Prince Ghika, a Romanian bishop.<br><br>
When war broke out in September, Irène and Michel took their two small daughters, Denise and Elisabeth, to the safety of Issy-l’Evêque, in Saône-et-Loire, the village where their nanny, Cécile Michaud, came from. There, they were left in the care of Cécile’s mother, Madam Mitaine.<br><br>
For the first months of the war, Irène and Michel stayed in Paris, making frequent journeys to visit their children. Then, in June 1940, the Germans occupied Paris and the Némirovskys decided to leave Paris altogether, taking up residence in a hotel opposite the house of Cécile Michaud, the Hôtel des Voyageurs. From then on life became increasingly difficult. On 3 October 1940, a law was passed giving Jews inferior legal and social standing. Most important, it defined, based on racial criteria, who was to be considered Jewish in the French State. The Némirovskys, who took part in an enforced census in June 1941, were both Jewish and foreign: their baptism certificates were useless. Michel no longer had the right to work at the bank; the publishing houses were “Aryanising” their personnel and authors, so Irène could no longer be published. Further race laws passed in October 1940 and June 1941 stipulated that Jews could be placed under house arrest or deported and interned in concentration camps. Issy-l’Evêque was now in the occupied zone and the Hôtel des Voyageurs was full of German soldiers. Irène, her husband and her daughters all openly wore the Jewish star.<br><br>
Irène Némirovsky watched what was happening with pitiless clarity: she had no doubt that these events would result in tragedy. But life went on. Denise celebrated her first Communion, despite going to the local school with the Jewish star sewn prominently on to the front of her coat. Michel amused himself by writing a multiplication table for Denise in rhyme. The family were finally able to find a large house to rent. Irène read and wrote constantly. Every day, after breakfast, she would go out, sometimes walking for ten kilometres before finding a spot she liked. Then she would start working. Between 1940 and 1942, the publishing house Albin Michel and the director of the anti-Semitic newspaper Gringoire agreed to help her publish her short stories under various pseudonyms. She also wrote a life of Chekhov and a novel, Les Feux de l’automne, which would not be published until 1957. But, most important, in 1941 she started work on an ambitious novel to be called Suite Française.<br><br>
Némirovsky began Suite Française, as was her habit, by writing notes on the work in progress and thoughts inspired by the situation in France. She created a list of characters, both major and minor, then checked that she had used them correctly. She dreamed of a book of a thousand pages, constructed like a symphony, but in five sections, according to rhythm and tone. She took Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony as a model.<br><br>
On 12 June 1942 she began to doubt she would be able to complete this huge endeavour. She had a premonition that she didn’t have long to live. But she continued work on her book, simultaneously writing notes. She called these lucid, cynical remarks Notes sur l’état de France (Notes on the State of France). They prove that she had absolutely no illusions, not about the attitude of the inert French masses—“loathsome” in their defeat and collaboration—nor about her own fate. As she wrote at the top of the first page:<br><br>
To lift such a heavy weight,<br><br>
Sisyphus, you will need all your courage.<br><br>
I do not lack the courage to complete the task<br><br>
But the goal is far and time is short.<br><br>
In her writing she denounced fear, cowardice, acceptance of humiliation, of persecution and massacre. She was alone. It was rare to find anyone in the literary and publishing worlds who did not choose to collaborate with the Nazis. Every day, Irène would go to meet the postman, but there were increasingly few letters from her publishers. She did not try to escape her fate by fleeing—to Switzerland for example, which was taking in a small number of Jews coming from France, especially women and children. She saw the situation in such bleak terms that on 3 June she wrote her Will and gave it to the children’s governess, asking that she take care of Denise and Elisabeth if necessary. She gave precise instructions, listing all the possessions she had managed to save, which could be sold to provide money to pay the rent, heat the house, buy a stove, hire a gardener who would tend the vegetable garden to provide food while rationing lasted; she provided the addresses of her daughters’ doctors, and details of their diet. Not a word of revolt. A straightforward understanding of the situation exactly as it was—hopeless.<br><br>
On 3 July she wrote, “Just let it be over—one way or the other!” She saw the situation as a succession of violent shocks that could kill her.<br><br>
On 11 July she was working in the pine forest, sitting on her blue cardigan “in the middle of an ocean of rotting leaves drenched by last night’s storm, as if on a raft, my legs folded beneath me.” That day she wrote a letter to her editor at Albin Michel that left no doubt about her certainty that she would not survive the war: “My dear friend . . . think of me sometimes. I have done a lot of writing. I suppose they will be posthumous works, but it helps pass the time.”<br><br>
On 13 July 1942, the French police knocked at the Némirovskys’ door. They had come to arrest Irène. On 16 July, she was interned in the concentration camp at Pithiviers in the Loiret region. The next day she was deported to Auschwitz in Convoy number 6. She was registered at the extermination camp at Birkenau, and as she was very weak, was sent to the Revier.*2 She died on 17 August 1942.<br><br>
When Irène was taken away, Michel did not understand that to be arrested and deported meant certain death. Every day he expected her to come home and insisted, at mealtimes, that her place be set at the table. In complete despair, he wrote to Marshal Pétain to explain that his wife had a delicate constitution and to request permission to take her place in the labour camp.<br><br>
In October 1942, the Vichy government responded by arresting him. He was first imprisoned at Creusot, then Drancy, where his search document shows that 8,500 francs were taken from him. On 6 November 1942, he too was deported to Auschwitz and was sent straight to the gas chamber.<br><br>
Immediately after arresting Michel Epstein, the police went to the village school to get Denise, but her schoolteacher hid her behind her bed. The police did not give up and continued their hunt. The Nemirovskys’ governess had the presence of mind to remove the Jewish star from their clothes and flee the village with the little girls. They spent the rest of the war moving between hiding places. The first was a Catholic boarding school, where two of the nuns knew the little girls were Jewish. There Denise was given a false name but she never managed to get used to it, so she was often scolded in class because she didn’t reply when she was called. But the French police—who it seems had little better to do than hunt down two children so they might share the same fate as their parents—picked up their trail. The girls were forced to leave the convent to hide out in a series of cellars in the region of Bordeaux. Whenever they boarded a train to move on, the governess would tell Denise to hide her nose. When Denise caught a chest infection, the people who were hiding her didn’t help her to see a doctor.<br><br>
The war over, the two girls returned to Paris and went to their grandmother’s house to ask for help. Fanny had spent the war years in Nice, living in great comfort, but when the children rang the doorbell she refused to let them in, shouting through the closed door that if their parents were dead they should go to an orphanage. (Fanny died in 1972, in a large apartment in Paris on the avenue Président Wilson. The only things found in her safe were two books by her daughter: Jezebel and David Golder.) Each day, wearing a sign with their names written on it, Denise and Elisabeth would make their way to the platform of the Gare de l’Est, where trains carrying the survivors of the concentration camps were beginning to arrive. They would also go to the Hôtel Lutétia, which had been turned into a reception centre for returning deportees—once, Denise began to run down the street after a woman because she thought she recognised her mother—but eventually it became clear that their parents were not coming back.<br><br>
         <br><br>
That the manuscript of Suite Française should have survived in such circumstances is extraordinary. It was Denise who put it into a suitcase as she and her sister fled Issy l’Evêque. She had often watched her mother writing—in tiny handwriting to save ink and paper—in the large leatherbound notebook. She took it as a memento of her mother. The suitcase accompanied Denise and Elisabeth from one precarious hiding place to another. After the war, they couldn’t bring themselves to read the notebook—having it was enough. Once, Denise tried to look inside to see what was there, but it was too painful. Many years passed, and she and her sister, Elisabeth, who had become an editor in a publishing house under the name Elisabeth Gille, agreed they should entrust their mother’s notebook to the Institut Mémoires de l’édition contemporaine, an organisation dedicated to documenting memories of the war, in order to preserve it. Before giving it up, Denise decided to type it out. With the help of a large magnifying glass, she began the long, difficult task of deciphering the minuscule handwriting. Soon she discovered that these were not simply notes or a private diary, as she had thought, but a violent masterpiece, a fresco of extraordinary lucidity, a vivid snapshot of France and the French—spineless, defeated and occupied: here was the exodus from Paris; villages invaded by exhausted, hungry women and children battling to find a place to sleep, if only a chair in a country inn; cars piled high with furniture, mattresses and pots and pans, running out of petrol and left abandoned in the roads; the rich trying to save their precious jewels; a German soldier falling in love with a French woman under the watchful eye of her mother-in-law; the simple dignity of a modest couple searching amidst the chaos of the convoys fleeing Paris for a trace of their wounded son . . .<br><br>
Denise Epstein sent the manuscript to the publisher Denoël. Sixty-four years after Nemirovsky’s death, we are finally able to read the last work of a writer who had held a mirror up to France at its darkest hour.<br><br>
When Denise Epstein entrusted the manuscript of Suite Française to the archives, she felt tremendous sadness that her sister Elisabeth Gille, who died in 1996, had not been able to read it. Elisabeth had, herself, written Le Mirador (The Watchtower): a magnificent imagined biography of the mother she never had the chance to know. She was only five years old when Irène Némirovsky died in Auschwitz.<br><br>
