<center><b><i>Preface to the English edition</i></b></center><br><br>

IN the past two centuries, the Anglo-Saxon peoples have been
spared the experience of occupation, whereas it has constituted a
painful part of the recent history of almost all of the countries of
continental Europe and continues to hold an important, or even
central, place in their memories. This may explain the persistence,
among the Anglo-Saxons, of a critical attitude compounded of
moralism and their sense of possessing clear consciences where
those European peoples are concerned, particularly the French
whose behaviour during the Second World War is often the subject
of ferocious condemnation. There are clearly also other reasons for
this: irritation over French foreign policy of the Gaullist ilk or over
the anti-Americanism that is certainly widespread in France. But
there is a deeper reason that cannot be overlooked: the politics of the
Vichy regime and its complicity in the Nazi crimes - first andforemost
the Holocaust - are regarded, quite rightly, as so
unworthy of the country that produced the Declaration of Human
Rights as to besmirch its image, possibly irremediably.<br><br>

Despite their distance from France, or perhaps thanks to it, British
and American historians have made valuable contributions to the
history of France’s ‘black years’. On the one hand, I should mention
the analyses of Stanley Hoffmann (himself both a French and an
American citizen), analyses which still, after thirty years, retain
much of their incisive force, and the works of Robert Paxton, which
remain an indispensable reference.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-301">[1]</a> On the other, I should refer to
the many studies of a more monographic nature, in particular those
of Harry R. Kedward and John F. Sweets, that have cast new light on
the life of French society during that period, often at a local or
regional level.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-302">[2]</a><br><br>

<b>(p.viii)</b><br><br>

The present work acknowledges that twofold debt through the
approach that it adopts, tackling now from the top, now from the
bottom, the variety of ways in which French society adapted to the
extraordinary situation constituted by its occupation by Nazi Germany.
I have made use of the notion of accommodation so as to direct
attention beyond the commonly accepted idea of collaboration that is
seen in an essentially politico-ideological p,erspective. That perspective
may be indispensable for giving an account of the action of the
Vichy leaders and the attitude of those of their compatriots - the
collaborationists - who adopted a position favouring entente w1th
the conqueror; but it is unsuitabale for a satisfactory understanding
of the far more numerous choices of adaptation made by French
society as a whole.<br><br>

The fact is that, right alongside behaviour that indicated a measure
of commitment to collaboration, many French people lived
through the occupation with the sole preoccupation of ‘getting
through it’. My aim has been to place such attitudes within their
true context - that of a partially confused image of the occupier, an
opaque future, disagreement as to the correct definition of the
national interest, and the burdensome business of securing the
necessities of life - and to explore their social and cultural origins.
For any society, an occupation is a trial and, in a way, represents a
moment of truth for it: all the tensions, frustrations and contradictions
at work that undermine the social contract come to the
surface, on top of which a way to live must be found, even in the
presence of a foreign power intent upon persecution and extermination,
and also bent upon enrolling support and neutralizing opposition.
Despite their. great diversity, there was not a single country in
Nazi Europe that did not, to some degree, witness the emergence of
accommodating behaviour. In the Conclusion to this work, I have
tried to establish the parameters of that ubiquitous accommodation,
partly imposed but partly voluntary. If Britain or even the United
States had been subjugated and occupied, the proportion of enforced ;
submission as compared to deliberate adaptation would perhaps
have been different, but is it conceivable that such elements, including
the second variety, would have been entirely absent?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-303">[3]</a><br><br>

The reader may quarrel with the quasi-absence of the resistance
in this study. But that absence is a natural corollary to the choice of a
perspective designed to focus upon the analysis of the behaviour of
adaptation, and it in no way signifies any undervaluation of the role
of the resistance. Even if its military efficacy was limited, at least up <b>(p.ix)</b> 
until the middle of 1943, its moral and political impact was great
nght from the start. It seems to me that, far from diminishing it, this
study of accommodation in effect further ennobles its role by contrast,
by throwing into relief the lucidity and courage of the tiny
minority of French people who did say ‘no’ to the occupier and did
endeavour to translate that ‘no’ into actions.<br><br>

This study’s concentration on the experience of France may be
regarded as another limitation. It would indeed have been good to
produce more of a comparison with the experience of other peoples,
in particular those in Western Europe. However, although a mountain
of works exists on the subject, most are national monographs
centred upon political and military history, so a comparison devoted
to the greater or lesser degree of accommodation in a variety of
societies would have very little data to go on. To the extent that
the present work focuses upon a number of aspects seldom, if ever,
studied - personal relations between the occupiers and the occupied,
decisions to learn the occupiers’ language, attendance at the
lectures, exhibitions and concerts organized by them, etc. - and,
more generally, endeavours to pinpoint the diverse reactions of one
society, French society, it possibly provides some data that might one
day prove useful in the composition of a systematic comparison.<br><br>

Lastly, I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to my two
publishers, Andre Schiffrin of The New Press (New York) and
Christopher Wheeler of Arnold (London), for all their support and
for their trust in me. I should also like to thank Janet Lloyd for her
fine work of translation. I dedicate this book to my daughter Claire.
If one day she comes to read it, she will understand how sorry I was -
not to have spent more time playing with her.<br><br>

<center><b><i>Introduction</i></b></center><br><br>

FOREIGN occupation constitutes a massive, brutal intrusion into the
familiar frameworks of a society. It imposes authority and
demands obedience founded upon neither tradition nor consent. It
disrupts the networks and routines of collective life and confronts
groups and individuals with choices which, in such circumstances,
are very grave. In June 1940, a staggering defeat resulted in threefifths
of France passing under foreign domination; with the remaining
two-fifths suffering the same fate in November 1942. The French
found themselves living under the Nazi jackboot. Enemy troops were
encamped on their soil, moved about their streets, went in and out of
their houses. The enemy set the rules for daily life, even upset the
temporal order: no sooner were they ensconced than the invaders
imposed their own summer time. This presence, brought about by
armed force and maintained by its threat, returned the French to one
of those situations experienced by many peoples at one time or
another, a situation to which France itself had been subjected, on a
lesser scale, on several occasions in the past and one that other
peoples too were living through at that moment in Nazi Europe.<br><br>

The present work attempts to reconstruct the ways in which
French people reacted to an extraordinary situation, and to rediscover
how they behaved under the occupation and towards the occupiers. Total 
rejection of the occupiers was bound to be no more than marginal: a few departed 
to England, to join de Gaulle; others moved clandestinely to the free zone where a new government,
itself a product of the defeat and occupation, imposed its law.
But for the vast majority there seemed no alternative but to submit,
bow before the triumphant force and adjust one’s behaviour accordingly.
Despite their secret defiance, even those determined to resist <b>(p.2)</b> 
had to appear to compromise in the interests of their underground
activities, as they waited for a superior force to bring liberation and
to reset the clock. Accommodation was forced upon the French
people, who had to choose the least of all evils and make concessions
that might or might not prove compromising.<br><br>

But accommodation was not always limited to its minimum forms,
however elastic these might be. If it had been, the memory of this
period would be less painful. The war left behind it death, ruins and
physical suffering. The occupation, in contrast, inflicted wounds not
so much physical as moral and political - wounds that have still not
fully healed. In truth, such a situation puts society as a whole to the
test, the more so when that society is riven by tensions and divisions,
undecided as to what is right or just, or simply when the
general interest is subordinated t the protection and promotion of
personal or corporative interests. It is further aggravated when the
occupying power intervenes to profit from this state of affairs,
employing divisive tactics, seducing and soliciting at the same
time as exploiting, repressing and persecuting; and that, precisely,
was Nazi Germany’s policy in France.<br><br>

As a substantial minority saw it, there was no point in aiming for
and sticking to a minimum degree of compromise. The kind of
accommodation deliberately chosen by this minority was marked
by indulgence for the powerful of the day, sympathy for certain
aspects of their ideology and politics, a desire for agreement or
entente, and offers to be of service to them or even to enter their
service. Some simply judged it opportune to adapt in this way at a
time when the enemy’s victory appeared too extensive to be
reversed; as they saw it, the French people had to resign themselves
to living in the German hour. Others believed it indispensable to
reach lasting agreement with yesterday’s enemy; in their view, it was
positively good for France to embrace the German hour.<br><br>

The object of the present work is to produce a general review of
those attitudes and patterns of behaviour, using both German and
French sources, consulting personal diaries of the period that are far
more revealing than later memoirs, and also drawing upon an
abundance of other works, many of them of extremely high quality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">[1]</a>
But make no mistake: there can be no question of dissolving the
notion of collaboration within the general category of accommodation,
for it represented its most obvious manifestation; it was, so to
speak, accommodation raised to the level of politics. Rather, my
intention is to cover all forms of adaptation, with a view to grading <b>(p.3)</b> 
them and distinguishing their specific characteristics, seizing upon
all kinds of different behaviour and complex motives so as to
reconstitute the vast grey area that produces the dominant shade
in any picture of those dark years.<br><br>

We shall be focusing in turn upon three sections of French
society, all of which manifested the basic elements of accommodation:
that is to say a sense of constraint, material self-interest,
personal compliance, and ideological convictions or connivance.
The first section is the French government, which held a number
of trump cards in power politics - a free zone, a fleet and the empire
- and which, professing reasons of state that reflected a diplomatico-strategic
line of thought and a desire to survive as a regime, used
these trump cards as the basis foritspolicy of so-called collaboration.
The second section is the civil society subjected to the occupation,
in all the diversity of its groups and behaviour, right across the
board from the Church to the universities, taking in business circles,
enthusiasts for German culture and creators of French culture. Here,
some may have considered it a virtue to make the best of a bad job,
while others were only too ready to come to terms with the occupiers,
anxious as they were to pull through, maintaining their
personal positions or improving upon them, guaranteeing the present
and safeguarding the future. The third section, within that civil
society, is made up of the small but by no means negligible circle
of po1iticians, journalists or ordinary French people who saw fit to
commit themselves, playing politics in the presence of the occupier,
expressing collaborationist opinions, professing agreement
with the conqueror, militating in his favour, and even donning his
uniform.<br><br>

These three sections are all part of the same reality, although in
their respective adjustments to the massive presence of the occupier
there was room for considerable variations. Each evolved a predominating
logic that developed its own rhythm and reached its climax
in its own time. That is a fact that highlights not only the wide
diversity and deep complexity of attitudes and behaviour but also
another essential dimension of this period, namely its changes of
perspective. Nothing illustrates this better than the evolution of the
word ‘collaboration’ itself. Up until 1940 it meant work undertaken
in common, participation in a common task. In no time at all it also
took on the meaning of betrayal to the profit of the invader, or at the
very least compromising with an occupying power: an astonishing
enrichment of meaning through pejorative derision! The basis for <b>(p.4)</b> 
the new meaning can be traced back to the speech made by Petain on
30 October 1940, following his meeting with Hitler at Montoire, in
which he declared: ‘I am today setting out along the road of
collaboration.’ The word immediately passed into German (<i>Kollaboration</i>),
and thence into every other European language.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-202">[2]</a> From
then on it carried a dark connotation that testified to rejection of
a policy found controversial right from the start and eventually
condemned without right of appeal. The shift in the meaning of
this word that Petain had used in a positive sense (for of course be
did not mean to say ‘I am today setting out along the road of
disaster’ or ‘the road of betrayal’) and that then became as black
as ink and as heavy as lead makes one realize how important it is for
us to understand bow things looked at the time to people who did
not know where they were going and many of whom could not
really see the enemy clearly for what he was.<br><br>

In the summer of 1940, the French had no way of foreseeing the
four years through which they were about to live. The occupation
did not begin with Oradour-sur-Glane. As always happens in adaptations
to extraordinary conditions and in every period of rapid
change, attitudes changed from one year to the next. The immediate
past was unconsciously reconstructed so that, at the end of the road,
it was quite natural to think that there had been clear and constricting
choices to be made right from the start. Any history of this
period should take into account just how opaque the future was,
how quickly opinions can change, bow much resolution can waver
and how tempting accommodation must have seemed. The occupation
put the whole of French society to the test. It gave rise to
contrary reactions and to unclear, uncertain and ambivalent attitudes.
Nobody was dispensed from making a choice.<br><br>

<center><b><i>Public opinion</i></b></center><br><br>

BERNANOS, who had spent the war in Brazil, wrote after his return
to France: ‘If one could ... plot a graph of the chances of an
allied victory precisely, month by month, between 1940 and 1945,
one would notice that, through a curious application of the old
principle of elementary physics, that of communicating vessels, it
coincided perfectly with the curve of the increasing numbers supporting
a hypothetical Victory Party, first for a German victory, then
for an allied victory.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> But this pamphleteer, who had penned a moral
portrait of Vichy with such inspired violence, was mistaken about
the attitude of most of his compatriots if he really thought them so
anxious to be on the right side and so prompt to switch camps in
consequence. His representation is close to another that is even more
widely known, that of the metamorphosis of forty million Petainists
into forty million Gaullists. Neither does justice to French public
opinion on collaboration. One should not only take account of its
broad tendencies and how they evolved, but also understand their
cohesion and internal force, as well as remembering the waverings
and mobility of people’s minds. As Claude Mauriac correctly
observed, ‘What French person would be capable of recognizing
everything he or she thought and said (let alone did) under the
occupation?’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a><br><br>

Dictatorships are always curious to discover the state of mind of
the people that they gag. Vichy and the occupier were constantly
monitoring the pulse of the French people. The German authorities
- bad at their disposal the network of Kommandaturen and Propaganda-
Staffeln, the antennae of the SD and the Abwehr, and the
Wehrmacht armament service (the Wi., Ru.-Stab). They could also
keep an eye on the free zone through the control commissions that <b>(p.178)</b>
went on their rounds to ensure that the armistice terms were being
respected. Only the embassy was short of eyes and ears. In order
not to be left out, it created an investigation service, employing
Frenchmen who had manifested an interest in its propaganda
material. In the summer of 1942, it had at its disposal 948 correspondents,
348 of whom were ‘tried and tested collaborationists’,
who filled in forty-three questionnaires for it.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> As for the French
government, it possessed an administration that kept it minutely
informed. In the free zone, where it had freedom of movement, it
went so. far as to poke its nose into private correspondence.
Military men dispensed with their honour and listened in to telephone
conversations, intercepted telegrams, and each week ploughed
their way through several hundred thousand letters. This provided
them with material on which to base syntheses that reflected in equal
measure their desire to give an accurate account and their fear of
causing displeasure.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>

A cross-section of these sources shows, beyond any doubt, that
the vacillation provoked in 1940 by the shock of defeat and the
correct bearing of the Germans did not outlast the autumn, with its
combination of British resistance, the aggravations of the occupation,
and the prospect of a trying winter. From that moment on most
of the population wanted victory for England and manifested
towards collaboration sentiments that ranged from scepticism to
hostility. From mid-1941 on, the German attack on the USSR, followed
by the hostage executions, increased both the diffusion and
the strength of that tendency. In 1942 the <i>Relève</i> and the allied
landings in North Africa discredited collaboration definitively.
Even the English bombing raids, which took their toll of more
and more victims, did not reverse public opinion.

That is not really surprising. The conditions that played against
Vichy were overwhelmingly unfavourable. Germany’s image, which
was riddled with negative clichés and prejudices, even if the early
days of the occupation undermined these a little, faced a bulwark of
negative tradition. At its foot, the policies of repression and persecution
of the occupying power soon created a moat of hatred. It is
true that the assassinations perpetrated by the communists were
met, in the summer of 1941, by quasi-general disapproval; but the
savagery of the ensuing repression soon changed attitudes. On top of
all this was economic exploitation on a scale that exceeded all
expectations. It was designed to impoverish the entire population <b>(p.178)</b> 
and did indeed gradually come to affect even those who had at first
managed to elude it.<br><br>

The occupiers squeezed the country like a lemon and could only
resort to propaganda to attempt to persuade the French that it was
all for their own good. They did so with the greatest energy. turning
out brochures, tracts and posters by the million, flooding the press
and cinemas with images fabricated with care and sometimes with
considerable talent. The embassy itself, for whom propaganda was
certainly not the prime mission, distributed over 17 million different
brochures, 10 million tracts, and 400,000 copies of twenty-three
different posters in the space of two years,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> as well as launching
itself into the production of films and plays and constructing a
publications empire that eventually came to monopolize almost
half the periodicals of Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a><br><br>

Results did not measure up to all these efforts and such lavish
expenditure. The occupiers were obliged to recognize the supremacy
of the English and Gaullist propaganda. All they could do was try to
limit its influence and dissuade the French from acting on their
sympathies. So long as the German armies were sweeping all before
them, Goebbels’ propaganda machine was able to convey an image of
power and destruction impressive enough to paralyse attempts at
active resistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a><br><br>


As for the Vichy regime, it too had set up a considerable apparatus,
under the direction of Marion. It was partly inspired by the
propaganda of the conqueror and it suffered the same discredit.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>
The BBC broadcasts and the diffusion of rumours hostile to the
occupier brought French people together and separated them from
the occupiers and likewise from their government.<br><br>

It was not long before the majority of French people rejected
collaboration, but with significant variations from one zone to
another. Let us leave aside Alsace and Lorraine, whose inhabitants
were subjected to the reality of annexation and germanization.
There, a powerful sense of abandonment prevailed, and the absence
of public protests from Vichy was interpreted as acquiescence before
a <i>fait accompli</i>. In the prohibited zone, the rejection of collaboration
was both massive and immediate. Memories of the earlier occupation
were revived by the measures- without equivalent elsewhere- that
were taken there in the very first months: large numbers of hostages
were taken; men were seized in the streets for deportation to the
Reich and, in one locality, even women were rounded up, for
gynaecological examinations. The reaction of public opinion to the <b>(p.180)</b>
last of these measures was so strong that the Germans discontinued
such antiquated practices inherited from the previous occupation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a>
Here too, annexation seemed to loom, sharpening the sense of being
ill defended by Vichy. whose political inclinations had nothing to
recommend them to this bastion of socialism and trade unionism.
Furthermore, the image of the English was traditionally favourable
here, so that by and large everything combined to incline the
population to condemn the armistice. Petainism was to be found
among the bourgeoisie, but in most cases it was accompanied by
rejection of its foreign policies.<br><br>

In the occupied zone, the rejection of collaboration was less
immediate, but spread quite rapidly. In a report produced in September
1940, the military of the Wehrmacht’s armaments service
(the Wi. Rü-Stab.) expressed a succinct but general and at the same
time quite subtle judgement: ‘The population is on the whole calm,
occasionally welcoming, but most of the time reserved and to some
extent positively hostile.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> As for the government, it was for the
most part ignored, criticized or scorned. It was a long way away,
appeared to be impotent, and was all for collaboration. At the end of
1940, the postal censorship summarized the situation as follows: ‘For
the people of the occupied zone, the very mention of the word
collaboration evokes an image of the people of Alsace and Lorraine
ejected from their homes and another, no less horrible, of impending
famine.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Petain was spared, however, and continued to enjoy a
degree of respect that was certainly denied to Laval. However, by
the spring of 1941, the postal censorship was admitting that public
opinion in the occupied zone was ‘hardly at all favourable’ to Vichy,
and even that the ‘aura’ of the Marshal did not penetrate very far.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a><br><br>

In the free zone, opinion was divided over collaboration: rejection
was neither general nor immediate. The inhabitants were more
exposed to Vichy’s propaganda, more affected by the popularity of
Petain who, they believed, would protect them against an undesirable
extension of the occupation. His national revolution, which met
with ‘almost total indifference’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> had little to do with his popularity;
the regime stood high in public opinion because it spared them
the presence of the Germans, was trying to improve relations
between the two zones and also to get the prisoners repatriated.<br><br>

Despite anglophilia, which increased, far more of the population
than in the occupied zone followed the Marshal and continued to do
so for longer,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> albeit somewhat reluctantly. Thanks to Petain’s
speech, Montoire left people feeling a mixture of hope and anxiety, <b>(p.180)</b> 
rather than a general revulsion. The support for Vichy was nevertheless
fragile and was accompanied by widespread scepticism. ‘This
collaboration with Germany, which many reckon to be impossible
anyway (”the Boches are still the Boches, after all”), does not
exclude general hope for an English victory, as only this can deliver
France from the grip of the conqueror.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> At the end of the year,
trust in Petain increased, even in the occupied zone, with the
sacking of Laval, which many interpreted as a check to collaboration
and a sign of the profundity of the Marshal’s thinking.<br><br>

In the spring of 1941, the Paris negotiations, followed by the
Syrian affair, to some extent dissipated illusions, at the same time
sharpening opposed attitudes. A survey drew attention to ‘the
extremely grave repercussions that followed from collaboration,
which created an increasingly deep division between supporters of
this policy and opponents of it’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> Just as after Montoire, Petain’s
speech, covering Darlan’s meeting with Hitler in May 1941, was
reassuring and encouraged a ‘reasoned resignation’ fed by the hope
of concessions on the demarcation line and the prisoners’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> A turning
point was reached with the German attack against the USSR,
which was greeted with satisfaction by virtually everybody, some
rejoicing at the destruction of communism, others at the weakening
effect that this war might have upon the Germans, yet others for both
those reasons at once. Although the effect of the first of these
reactions was to give collaboration increased credibility, its appeal
was still far weaker than the hope of Germany being defeated or
exhausted, and both of the latter hypotheses were encouraged by the
resistance put up by the Soviets. In August, surveys for the first time.
showed ‘a noticeable fall in support for the policy of collaboration’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a><br><br>


The German control commissions that operated in the free zone
produced a similar picture of this development. In the previous
autumn their members had noticed that anglophilia was growing,
while support for the government was diminishing because of its
external policies. At that time, they had encountered no hatred in
their travels and seldom any insults.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> In the summer of 1941,
however, jeers came thick and fast, with young people yelling
‘boches’ or ‘shits’ at them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> They registered that there were many
people who were expecting difficulties for the Germans in the East,
and who were cheered by this. Vichy was coming in for more and
more criticism; the government’s standing in public opinion was
‘low’, and the Marshal himself was no longer spared.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a><br><br>

In Vichy, the change of atmosphere was noticed and prompted <b>(p.182)</b> 
Petain to deliver his speech about ‘the evil wind’. He thereby gave a
leg up to the minority current of opinion that supported the national
revolution, which thereafter hardened in its denunciation of those
who opposed it. The situation continued to deteriorate none the less.
‘The need for a policy of collaboration with Germany seems to be
accepted by no more than quite a limited number of French people’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22</a>]
the second to last survey of the year reported. Petain’s position
continued to weaken despite the fact that his prestige remained
considerable and his stock rose from time to time, as after his speech
of January 1942, in which he spoke of his ‘semi-captivity’. In the
spring of 1942, the control commissions observed that ‘Down with
Petain’ graffiti were no longer a rarity and that in many places his
appearance on the cinema screeri was no longer greeted with
applause.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a><br><br>

Laval’s return set off a new wave of doubts and speculation, in an
atmosphere of reserve and distrust. But even at this date, part of
public opinion remained unconvinced of the futility of all Vichy’s
efforts. However, it could not swallow Laval’s speech. His wish for a
German victory was greeted with ‘intense emotion’ and ‘general
stupefaction’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> In the autumn of 1942, the Vichy services recognized
the failure of their official policies: ‘In general, it is possible to
detect in the attitude of those questioned the growing feeling that,
all things considered, it would be better to adopt an attitude
towards Germany that openly corresponds “to the wishes of the
vast majority” of French people, even at the price of the risks
involved, given that now the Reich “is in command in the free
zone just as it is in the occupied zone”. That solution would have
the advantage of resto)lpg the national unity that is compromised by
the demarcation line.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> One month before the landings and Phain’s
confirmation of his policies, many people had already come to the
conclusion that there was no longer any justification for Vichy.
Petain’s aura was, however, not totally dissipated. As a public
figure, he continued to be respected to the bitter end by part of
the population, which felt compassion for him and regarded him as a
symbol of their suffering country. Meanwhile, a by no means
negligible fraction, despite thinning ranks, continued to regard
him as the country’s leader and the emblem of a political struggle.<br><br><br><br>


The majority tendency to reject collaboration left room for a current
that favoured it, the importance of which, up until 1942, should not
be discounted. Between September 1941 and May 1942, the postal <b>(p.183)</b> 
censorship of the free zone read on average 300,000 letters each week.
The subject most frequently evoked-food supplies-concerned only
5 per cent of the letters: French people above all wrote about their
families and their health. Depending on the weeks, between 2000 and
3500 letters (0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of the total) contained allusions
to Petain, the vast majority of them favourable. References to collaboration
appeared in only 700 to rooo letters (0.2 per cent to 0.3 per
cent). Between 20 and 30 per cent of these were positively appreciative
in 1941 and 25 per cent still were in April-May 1942.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a><br><br>


Although these figures cannot be claimed to rest on a representative
sample, they do provide a rough indication that coincides with
German estimates, which set rejection at 80 per cent. It does not
seem too unreasonable to suggest that up until 1942 the current
favouring collaboration concerned, on average, between one-quarter
and one-fifth of the French people in the free zone, and between
one-fifth and one-sixth of the country as a whole. This would, after
all, amount to several million people, many more than the membership
of the small collaborationist parties.<br><br>

But to what, exactly, was that approval given? It would be naive
to imagine that it was totally committed, coherent and continuous.
Three major views of collaboration are detectable from the reports
based on the Vichy censorship. The first was that of ‘providential’
collaboration. The defeat had revealed the enfeebled state of France;
it provided a chance for reform accompanied by an <i>entente</i> with the
conqueror. For some, the latter needed to be limited to political and
diplomatic alignment; others went so far as to argue for a military
alliance and co-belligerence against the Soviets or even against the
Anglo-Saxons. Some reckoned that collaboration implied following
the Nazi model, others simply that it was compatible with an
authoritarian regime, as invented by France.<br><br>

The second view of collaboration was of a ‘realistic’ variety: like it
or not, German domination in Europe was there to stay. France had
to adjust its politics if it wished to safeguard the future, beginning
by defending its possessions against the Gaullists and the British.
This position was frequently associated with the hope of a bloodless
peace that would restore a dignified role to conquered France and
procure it a favourable peace treaty with Germany, which seemed
unlikely to be defeated. This was the major inspiration of Vichy’s
politics, but it existed alongside a current more influenced by the
‘providential’ view of collaboration (Benoist-Mechin, Marion, Bonnard,
etc.). According to postal censorship, the second view (of <b>(p.184)</b> 
realistic collaboration) was shared by some of the population. Thus,
on 18 November 1941, a report ran as follows: ‘People continue to be
delighted that both the Germans and the Russians are suffering
heavy losses. They are hoping that eventually France will act as
an intermediary for a compromise peace.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a><br><br>


The third view was of collaboration as an expedient: a policy
accepted with suspicion and resignation, in the short term, in the
hope of obtaining tangible alleviations to France’s lot. Most French
people did not believe, as Darlan did, that an English victory would
be more costly for France than a German one. But they were not all
confident of an English victory, and many feared what a lengthy war
would cost them. Germany was not a trusted partner, but if a policy
of accommodation could secure a few advantages, why not make the
most of it? Just so long as the future was not compromised and,
above all, France did not swing over into a war against the AngloSaxons.<br><br>

It is patently clear that, out of these three views, support was
strongest for the third, and weakest for the first, and that most
French people tempted by Petain’s politics belonged to the third
category. This fraction of the population followed the government,
veering between hope, scepticism and resignation but prepared, in
the last analysis, to allow themselves to be convinced. A synthesis of
the reports of the prefects in the free zone, for November 1941, on
the subject of collaboration, after noting that its supporters were
still few in number, continued: ‘On the whole, public opinion finds
this policy repugnant; it will submit to it if forced to, considering it
as a strictly provisional solution designed to play for time, to
alleviate the weight of the occupation, and to obtain a number of
immediate advantages (in particular the return of prisopers), but it
will continue to hope for an Anglo-American victory.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> Vichy was
aware that this was more or less the only remaining popular basis for
its policies, and was all the more anxious to make them pay off.<br><br>

The partisans of collaboration - if the word partisans can be used
in conjunction with an attitude that was in many cases so soft,
uncertain and lacking in confidence - seem to have been drawn
mostly from the bourgeoisie and the middle classes, to judge from
the scattered notations in the censorship reports. But they were also
to be found amongst prisoners of war and their families, whom
Vichy treated with considerable care. The postal censorship reports
stress the Petainism of these circles and their support for collaboration.
In the autumn of 1941, one even stated that in the occupied <b>(p.185)</b> 
zone support ‘came solely from the families of prisoners of war’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> It
still existed in November 1942, ‘manifesting itself through their
loyalty to the Marshal, the trust that most of them place in the
head of government, and a quite general anglophobia’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> As for the
prisoners still in the camps, their opinions were mixed: they were
strongly attached to Petain, but deeply divided over collaboration.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31</a>]
Repatriated prisoners, however, seem to have had a less equivocal
attitude. According to the postal survey, ‘a very large number of
them support a policy of collaboration’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> The Germans’ view of the
situation was similar: they reckoned the liberated prisoners to be
their best propaganda agents for collaboration’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a><br><br><br><br>



Vichy’s politics had the support of no more than a minority, and
even that was fragile, shaky and dwindling. One might have
expected it to be altogether crushed by the majority opinion. However,
rejection of collaboration was not necessarily either absolute or
intransigent; and it certainly did not amount to a choice in favour of
resistance. On the first of those two points, it seems legitimate to
wonder whether, if the Germans had made more visible concessions,
Vichy would not have been able to extend its basis and win over
quite a few sceptics. That was certainly the hope of its leaders,
possibly encouraged by the censorship reports, according to which
if collaboration produced tangible results, it would rally the whole
population.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a><br><br>

On the second point, it is worth pointing out that communicating
vessels - to return to Bernanos’ image - are hardly relevant where
public opinion is concerned.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> Rejection of collaboration and a
distancing from Vichy did not increase the level of resistance - or
only to a limited degree. Rather, they resulted in a degree of
passivity that all observers found remarkable and which uncertainty
about the future, the hardships of daily life, and the policies
of both the French and the German authorities all did much to foster.<br><br>

The most important thing to take into consideration is the uncertainty
as to the outcome of the war. In the first year, that uncertainty
was totally impenetrable and its effect was to make the French
people literally huddle together for comfort. Most were praying
for an English victory but can hardly have believed it likely,
certainly not in the near future. Although that hope grew stronger
as time passed, it was frequently dashed by the progress of the war.
The excitement of the summer of 1941 and at the end of the year
collapsed heavily at the beginning of 1942, then gave way to morose <b>(p.186)</b> 
depression, as the German offensive in the East revived the disappointment
felt at the inaction or reverses of the Allies. Even strong
lucid minds, as well informed as was possible, went through crises of
doubt up until the landings in North Africa.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> A poignant example
of the role of anticipation is supplied by the sudden collapse of the
number of conscripted people departing for Germany, in the summer
of 1943, as soon as Sicily had been taken by the Allies and Mussolini
had fallen. In the first third of 1943 they numbered 179371; in the
last three months, 12953.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> Earlier most of those requisitioned
obeyed orders; but later disobedience took over, as the turn of
military events indicated that liberation was not far off. The ranks
of the Maquis were swollen by young men who were then to face a
testing winter. This ‘average’ reaction of public opinion provides the
background against which to set the impressive courage of the tiny
minority who had opted for resistance even in the first two years. To
do so presupposed a quite unusual level of faith that does great
credit to those men and women.<br><br>

The trials of daily life were furthermore very real and, even as
the military situation began, pitifully slowly, to evolve in the
right direction, there were still no alleviations - in fact quite
the reverse. When they spoke of the ‘hard times’ they were living
through, French people restored full meaning to that over-used
expression. What with frozen salaries and rising prices, real
wages dropped by 37 per cent between 1938 and 1943 - and
that is simply an average.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> The weak and the disadvantaged were
afflicted by penury that provoked growth problems amongst
children, a higher death rate amongst the elderly, and a steep
rise in accidents and sickness amongst workers, many of whom
suffered from partial unemployment up until 1942.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> On top of all
this, virtually everywhere people had to endure painful separations,
with families dispersed in different zones, prisoners of war
held captive far away, and increasing numbers of displaced
persons and refugees as a result of allied bombing raids on the
Atlantic coast.<br><br>

The existence of the Vichy regime compounded all these difficulties,
for many considered it the legal, if not legitimate, government.
For some people, the national revolution introduced confusion,
hesitation on the score of the enemy, and doubt over priorities.
Such approval as greeted Vichy’s internal policies even led some
of those who resisted right from the start, such as Frenay and
General Cachet, to adopt acrobatic positions over Montoire.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> <b>(p.187)</b> 
Petain’s popularity, even when it had eroded, militated against a
rejection of collaboration and, even more, slowed down its translation
into actions. A sense of lassitude in the face of the war that
dragged on and on, and a longing for a speedy arrangement also
encouraged vacillation among even those who definitely disapproved
of collaboration.<br><br>

Finally, the Germans, in their own fashion, also promoted passivity,
in the first place through their victories, which encouraged
the notion that accommodation was inevitable; then through their
measures of repression, which became increasingly intransigent
from the summer of 1941 onwards, and thereby underlined the
perils of active opposition. In 1940 German military tribunals had
condemned eight people to death; between January and September
1941 the figure was fifty-one; between September 1941 and March
1942, it jumped to 236, added to which, in that last period, hostage
executions claimed 353 victims.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> There was plenty to cow the
French and they can hardly have derived much solace from comparing
their lot to that of Central and Eastern Europe, if indeed
they were even aware of it: in Serbia, in that same period between
September 1941 and March 1942, 27905 people were executed,
over 20000 of them by way of reprisals.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> In France, reactions
would certainly have been stronger if the Germans had continued
to execute hostages selected from amongst the ‘notables’, as they
had in the past. By executing Jews and communists instead, their
aim - partly successful, it must be said - was to foster a certain
complicit resignation. Amid all the repressive and exploitative
aspects of its policies, it did leave some pockets of freedom, under
surveillance of course, for example in the domain of culture and
amusements, and these encouraged illusions of normality. It is
interesting to speculate what would have happened if, as in
Poland, schools, universities, cinemas, theatres and publishing
houses had been closed down.<br><br>

These conditions kept many French people cocooned right to the
end. Rejection of occupation and collaboration existed alongside a
desire simply to get through it all; for many people the phoney
war lasted right through to 1944. Andrzej Bobkowski, a Polish
<i>émigré</i>, who left an invaluable diary chronicling the occupation,
noted in December 1940 that a factory cashier, hearing him talk of
escape to England, retorted: ‘One has to earn one’s own little
living, and that’s all there is to it.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> It was an attitude that
infuriated those who were resisting, sometimes to the point of <b>(p.188)</b> 
despair. Guéhenno speaks of ‘prostration’ in February 1942, then,
one year later, on the subject of obedience to the STO, declares:
‘This entire country is by now nothing but a frightened protoplasm.’
Finally, listening to the conversations of the pupils in his
lycee in the spring of 1944, he comments: ‘Still the same fear, the
same rot. People are terrified. They are wary of everything. the
Germans, the English, the Russians; all they can think about is
“getting through” without coming to any harm; it is as if, to the
great mass of this country, nothing matters except survival, at any
price.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a><br><br>

During the first two years at least, the attitude of the majority was
as far removed from a firm, aggressive state of mind as was the
attitude of the minority. So much was clear from the prudence and
discretion shown by virtually everybody. In March 1941, Paulhan
wrote: ‘Have I told you that in the little bistro where I drink a coffee
every morning in the company of five or six working men and
women from the <i>quartier</i>, never the same ones, in all their thousands
of complaints over three months I have never heard a single
mention of the Germans. It’s a matter of prudence, dignity, fear,
perhaps a mixture of all three.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> General Doyen noted that a British
victory was desired by the majority, but it was difficult to get any
clear picture as people were so prudent. ‘Those who favour Germany
are not very proud of the fact anyway, and those who favour
England are afraid of having their hopes dashed or, fear to voice
their opinion because of the possible consequences.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> May 1942,
Marc Bloch wrote to Lucien Febvre: ‘One of the things that strikes
me most today is how impossible it is for any of us to know what his
closest neighbour is thinking and doing . . . One sometimes makes
astonishing discoveries. I certainly have.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> Sometimes the motive for
this prudence was a fear of being denounced, but often it was also a
fear of being wrong or being labelled in public, so great was people’s
uncertainty and so persistent their confusion as to what was good or
right, wise or opportune.<br><br>

In the early days, collaboration was still simply an opinion that
divided people. It disgusted many, but it was tolerated and one
could agree to differ over it. In May 1941, Drieu sent his latest
work (<i>Écrits de jeunesse</i>) to Guéhenno, dedicating it as follows: ‘As a
token of our perfect disagreement’, which its recipient felt was
‘rather nice of him’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> In February 1941, François Mauriac had
written to Ramon Fernandez: ‘Our political disagreements are as
nothing to French people who drink from the same springs.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> One <b>(p.189)</b> 
of the most notable effects of this atmosphere, more detectable in
some circles than in others, was the tendency to hang back behind
bolder spirits, keeping one’s own counsel, so as not to stick one’s
neck out in the event of Germany losing the war, and at the same
time keep a foot in the door in case it was victorious.<br><br>

By mid-1941, differences of attitude were much sharper and
references to the Dreyfus affair were frequent. The prefect of
Finistere remarked in the autumn of 1941: ‘We are back in the
bad old days of the Dreyfus affair, with deep divisions even in
families. People are clarified as partisans either of collaboration or
of General de Gaulle.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> And in December 1942 Claude Mauriac
wrote: ‘“It’s a new Dreyfus affair”, my father told his brother
Pierre, who was passing through Paris. They are themselves divided
by such a chasm that they dare not talk to. each other without
extreme prudence.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a><br><br>

As time passed, the reference to the Dreyfus affair lost its pertinence.
Gradually, as the course of the war dissipated uncertainty and
put a stop to the quarrels that this had occasioned, collaboration
came to be regarded less and less as an opinion, and more and more
as an act of treachery. By the summer of 1941, instead of looking
back to the Dreyfus affair, people were already thinking in terms of
punishment and purges. In July that year, Angelo Tasca, a socialist
who had rallied to Vichy, noted with considerable alarm what he had
heard from a Parisian contact: ‘As soon as the Germans go, there will
be deaths, many: thousands. Everyone is looking forward to the day
when certain people will be tol:n to pieces.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> Such thinking was
almost palpable at the end of the following month, when people
learned of the assassination attempt against Laval and Deat. As
Guehenno noted, the people of Paris had ‘great difficulty in concealing
their joy’, ‘the joy of a horrifying hatred’. Paulhan had the
same impression in a little bistro in the nineteenth <i>arrondissement</i>,
where regulars, workers and unemployed men, were seized by a
‘strange joy’, deep and silent: ‘I shall never forget that little old
bookbinder who was literally <i>trembling</i> with joy, his normally wise
countenance suddenly wild. That is how the Commune must have
started, or at least been prepared for.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> The idea of retribution was
everywhere. On 10 September 1941, Fernand-Laurent spoke to
Jeanneney, the president of the Senate, of the need for a ‘ministry
of reprisals’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a><br><br>

The summer of 1941 certainly marked a turning point, or rather
the beginning of a turning point, one that developed gradually, not <b>(p.190)</b> 
without reversals, and only reached its climax at the end of 1942.
The atmosphere of those first two years, even then divided and
polarized, with its undertow of silent hatred brewing and strengthening,
but still crossed by many uncertainties, constituted the
background to accommodations of many kinds.<br><br>


<center><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></center><br><br>

AFTER the liberation, Europe was the scene of a vast purge that
rt affected millions of people. There was no precedent for the
phenomenon in the occupations that had punctuated history since
the French Revolution. The fact is that this occupation had been
different. Nazi Germany had imposed a heavy yoke and had reduced
the occupied peoples to wretchedness. The weight of Its jackboot
had become increasingly crushing. It had exterminated millions of
people, leaving behind it Auschwitz as a symbol of modern barbarity.
Furthermore, it had set out to annihilate all modern ideologies,
liberalism, democracy, socialism, communism and, eventually Christianity.
It had infringed the rights of nations by attempting to
impose the domination of a master-race that would exercise the
power of life or death over them. It is not surprising that those
who, in one way or another, associated themselves with this force
that was not simply a national occupier but also a regime implementing
a policy of ideological hegemony should have brought down
retribution upon themselves.<br><br>

France was the first liberated country to demand a reckoning.
After an extra-judicial purge that claimed 8ooo to gooo victims, the
judicial purge began by investigating Jooooo cases and ended by
passing sentence upon !2.4613 individuals. Slightly under 50000 of
these received prison sentences; of the 6763 condemned to death,
767 were executed, plus an equal number who had been sentenced
to death by military tribunals. Slightly over 50000 others were
stripped of their civic rights. There was also a professional purge,
especially in the administration, in which at least 25000 people
were penalized. In all, about xsoooo French people were probably
affected in one way or another.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[1]</a><br><br>

<b>(p.460)</b> This purge, which contributed to the fixing of the image of the
recent past, sought to settle the account for the experience of the
occupation by identifying and singling out a group of people
deemed accountable, upon which the collective feelings of the
French were then concentrated and vented, thereby purging the
ambivalences, ambiguities and uncertainties that had characterized
the experience of many individual French people. Thanks to the cold
war, the myth of an entire people committed to resistance logically
enough soon led to an amnesty designed to bring peace through the
reintegration of a handful of traitors. But from the 1970s onwards,
this image of the past became increasingly cracked: now the purge
seemed flawed and a growth of suspicions, encouraged by the
perception of a long-standing oblivion or a long-standing lie, produced
an impression of crimes unpunished, accountability insufficiently
identified, and a French people that had been besmirched as
a whole by the murky waters of the period. Attention now focused
upon the persecution of the Jews and the new sensitivity to human
rights that had taken over from nationalism and the major ideologies
bestowed upon those years a black image that spread to envelop
virtually everyone who had lived through it.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[2]</a><br><br>

It is impossible for historians to ratify either of these two images.
They have to remember that accommodation is a regular phenomenon
in almost any occupation, where certain points or interfaces of
contact are inevitably created and some adjustment to the new
situation has to be made. Like a dictatorship, an occupation does not
function purely by dint of constraint; it usually finds some more or
less stable and lasting basis in shared interests, and by constructing
networks of accommodation that link occupiers and occupied
together and make it possible for the machine to continue to operate.
The French, with their colonial past, are well placed to understand
that there can be no domination without a minimal degree of
acceptance, however fragile, and that divisions and diverging interests
in the subjugated societies are bound to play into the hands of
imperial dominion. Besides, it would not be fair systematically to
ascribe either a positive or a negative connotation to the phenomenon
of accommodation. After the Nazi catastrophe, the Germansor
at any rate those lucky enough to find themselves in the zones
occupied by the western Allies - reckoned that it was in their
interest to enter into association with their conquerors and together
establish the basis for a new state.<br><br>

Accommodation takes forms and incorporates degrees that need to <b>(p.461)</b> 
be distinguished so that they are not all muddled together. The first
form is a structural one imposed by the need to have public services
that continue to funcction and an economy that does not collapse.
Th1s IS all the more mevnable when the society involved is diversified,
the division of labour is highly developed, and interests and
sectors are deeply interconnected. Once an occupier seeks to exploit
the economy for his own needs, choices for the least of evils cannot
be avoided, choices in which survival for the national community
must be weighed against assistance given to the enemy, assistance
thanks to which that enemy might win its war and perpetuate its
domination. These are painful, agonizing choices, with the scales
always tipping to the same side, towards the stronger party, but it
would be hard to avoid them, given that an entire society cannot
take to the maquis as an individual can. But such an adaptation
should at least involve calculating one’s concessions as precisely as
possible, abstaining from anticipating the occupier’s demands and,
even more, from adopting policies that commit the country’s future.
That is what most of the French did; how could they have avoided
doing so?<br><br>

But with some people accommodation went further. It took on a
deliberate character, went beyond a minimal adaptation, and
involved initiatives that betrayed a desire for closer ties or some
agreement. Such behaviour amounted to providing, directly or
indirectly, material or moral assistance for the occupier’s policies.
These people did not simply make the best of the occupation; they
tried to adapt to the occupier in two distinct ways. The first may
be described as opportunist accommodation, for want of a better
term. It occurred within certain limits, with one eye always kept
on how the situation was developing, and was chiefly motivated
by a desire to defend or promote interests of either a personal or a
corporative nature, in a situation of uncertain outcome. But it
meant going more than halfway to meet the enemy and his
policies: as when people entered into social relations with him,
chose to produce or work for him, to frequent his propaganda
centres or learn his language, to adjust to the framework imposed
by him, even though other choices were possible and abstention
involved no great sacrifices. The term opportunism does not mean
that this pursuit of one’s own interests was necessarily purely
cynical or regardless of values. Although most of the accommodation
in this category may not have been primarily prompted by
politico-ideological motives, these were often present in some <b>(p.462)</b> 
limited or diffuse form, establishing a connivance that rendered
such gestures of cooperation all the easier to make.<br><br>

The second form of deliberate accommodation was, in the widest
sense, political. In these cases, people were seeking to come to an
agreement by taking a long-term view and were making a decision
that was fundamentally political, even if their motives were mixed,
even if their desire for such an agreement was prompted by resignation
more than enthusiasm, and even if they did set some limits
upon it. Political accommodation could range all the way from
declared support for a policy of <i>entente</i>, through sympathy for the
occupier’s propaganda, to enrolling in his forces and wearing his
uniform. In all these cases, it was necessarily combined with a
measure of ideological connivance, however limited and weak.<br><br>

These three forms of accommodation are to be found under
occupations generally. They allow for an analysis both broad and
differentiated, unlike the concept of collaboration, with its essentially
politico-ideological point of view, punitive inspiration and
denunciatory and polemic effect. At the liberation, the offence of
collaboration was defined and condemned in the complex context of
the current political balance of forces, principles of law and
judicial practices, and in accordance with a logic and with criteria
that it is impossible for a historian to accept integrally or to take
over. For that logic, based on criteria that focused primarily on aid
knowingly given to the enemy, left out of account structural
accommodation, despite the fact that this had been far and away
the most important from the occupier’s point of view. For at least
three years the Germans managed both to maintain their domination
and to keep the yoke in place, despite cutting to the minimum
the number of their troops assigned to maintaining order, and
thereby making it possible to reinforce other fronts and also to
exploit the economic resources of France in a most effective way.
Including prisoners of war and those forced into the STO, over four
million French people were working directly for the Germans in
1944 (2,600,000 in France and 1,314,000 in Germany), that is to say
37 per cent of the male population between the ages of sixteen and
sixty.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[3]</a> And that is not counting all the labour further up the
pipeline of the French economy that was contributing indirectly
to the German war effort. Objectively, this massive assistance,
obtained by dint of constraint and intimidation and facilitated by
the obvious desire of the French not to starve to death, far out- ,
weighs the courageous action of members of the resistance, even if, <b>(p.463)</b> 
this did make a remarkable contribution at the level of information, 
symbolism and both the political and the armed struggles, particularly
in the last months.<br><br>

Collaboration clearly did include political accomodation as 
defined above; and at the same time it incorporated a measure of 
opportunistic accomodation. But from an intellectual point of view 
there are no imperative reasons for drawing the exact demarcation 
line within this second category of collaboration at any particular 
level. The level of waht was considered actionable would vary, 
particularly in relation to the political forces present; no doubt 
the communists would have set it considerably lower than others. 
It is not the historian’s task to say whether there should have been 
more punishment or less; a historian’s perspective is quite simply 
different from that of those who carried out the purges. Consider the 
case of the people who set about learning German, particularly in the 
German Institute: was this collaboration or not? According to the 
rules laid down in the purge and from the point of view of liberal 
law, in which each case must be judged on its own merits, with a 
particular emphasis laid on intention, such behaviour could be 
regarded as providing no immediate aid to the enemy, quite apart 
from the matter of establishing whether such aid was intended by 
those involved. However, from a historian’s perspective, there could 
be nothing more significant than that movement towards the occupier’s 
language, nothing more interesting than the everyday, ambiguous, 
furtive forms of French society’s adjustment to the presence of 
the occupier. <br><br>

At the end of this enquiry it would at any rate appear that 
deliberate, voluntary accommodation extended well beyond the 
circle of those punished in the purges. It is understandable that its 
widespread nature - paradoxically enough felt more strongly with 
the passing of time, possibly because the extent of Pétain’s popularity 
became more and more shocking - should, over the past
twenty years, have given rise to suspicions. Yet it is worth repeating 
that the great majority of French people had no faith in collaboration 
and wanted none of it, and that they did behave worthily, even if 
their uncertainty and passivity in the first two years allowed a 
certain latitude to those who were venturing further towards accomodation. 
Many French people assuredly lived through a kind of prolonged phoney war 
from 1939 to 1944, in the hope that their country would be spared as much 
as possible: their memory of earlier trials and their sense of the national
weakness are <b>(p.464)</b> explanation enough. But, however inactive, their wait
for liberation was certainly impatient. To be a hero is honourable; not to be 
one is not necessarily dishonourable.<br><br>

The fact remains that, at the level of opinion, for a time at least and in 
a spirit of resignation or scepticism, many millions of French 
people did go along with the government’s policy of collaboration. 
At the level of behaviour, several hundred thousand of those 
occupied went to work for the occupiers or sought to obtain orders 
from them. Others, tens if not hundreds of thousands, tried to learn 
their language, attended the cultural events they organized and 
flocked to their propaganda exhibitions or even made social, sentimental 
or sexual overtures to them. Finally, at the partisan level, 
several hundreds of thousands held definitely positive opinions on 
collaboration and some expressed these through political or military 
commitment. These people came from every walk of life, with the 
working class strongly represented in certain roles. Proportionately, 
even if they remained in the minority, the more affluent classes were 
even more affected, by reason both of their political and social 
reflexes reinforced by grudges left over from the pre-war period 
and also of the situation itself, which propelled many of them into 
the front line in an administrative or entrepreneurial capacity. Since 
there was more at stake for them, rejection of accommodation was 
more costly just as its rewards were greater.<br><br>

To understand the widespread nature of the phenomenon, we 
must take into account the conditions that determined it in this - 
as in any other - occupation, conditions that operated with particular 
force in the first two years. The first conditioning factor, which 
decides everything else, is the policy that the occupier adopts, for it 
is the occupier who marks out the playing field and kicks off. By 
making a martyr of Poland, with the aim of destroying it not only as 
a state but also its national identity, the Nazis paralysed any 
attempts at cooperation on the part of its inhabitants in advance. 
In France, by contrast, they adopted a policy far less brutal than in 
Eastern Europe and more flexible than in the other, so-called 
‘Germanic’ countries of Western Europe.<br><br>

The second conditioning factor stems from the alternatives that 
exist, alternatives that are circumscribed by people’s assessment of 
the conqueror’s power and the likely duration of his domination, 
and also by their point of view of their possible liberators. With regard to the
first point, the prospect of lasting domination largely explains the 
resignation to the imperial yoke that was encountered in the <b>(p.465)</b> 
European empires: a resignation, or even acceptance, encouraged by
the advantages brought by the conqueror, which in part compensated
for his domination. In the case of Prance between 1940 and
1944, the fact that the war was continuing all around it was bound
to foster hope, and this acted as a check on widespread resignation.
As to the second point: if France had had the Soviet Union as a
neighbour and a potential liberator, as the peoples of Eastern Europe
did, it would probably have been far more prone to political accommodation.
The prospect of liberation by the Soviets was viewed
quite differently from the possible arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.<br><br>

The third conditioning factor is the degree of cohesion that exists
within the occupied society. A society’s receptiveness to the policies
of the occupier and its disposition towards accommodation are likely
to be greater if it is in a state of crisis or is divided against itself.
French society, like the other European societies occupied by Nazi
Germany, was fraught with tensions and these weakened its patriotic
rejection of occupation, even though the fundamental value of that
rejection was for the most part recognized, as is shown by the swift
and widespread realization that the fact of occupation called for a
particular pattern of behaviour - the observance of a code of
conduct for exceptional times.<br><br>

Some of those tensions were of a social nature and went beyond
mere feelings of resentment between different categories or layers of
society. We have already noted the serious effects that can be
produced by the phenomenon of sodal fragmentation and weakened
civic and national reactions in consequence of difficult social
conditions, inadequate education, or a subordinate position, all of
which erode people’s ability to reject collaboration with the occupier
and encourage them to grasp at any opportunity to profit from the
situation. The same attitude can be fostered by conflict between
one’s national loyalty and the protection of one’s personal interests.
Other tensions were political: aspirations for renewal, authoritarianism,
anticommunism, and antisemitism made people shortsightedly
detect positive aspects to Nazism. The nationalism that had been at
the source of most of these attitudes was weakened by the recognition
of a partial solidarity with the occupier in the struggle against
common enemies. This was a tendency that, in the case of collaborationists,
went so far as to encourage the idea of rebuilding the nation
with the aid of the conqueror. Finally, there were other tensions that
had to do with pacifism, a sense of the country’s weakness and a
desire to preserve French blood, which made people regard an <b>(p.466)</b>
enforced unification of the continent as necessary or even desirable.
All these elements were already present before the defeat. They
assumed even greater weight when Vichy highlighted and sanctioned
them.<br><br>

As it pursued its policy of collaboration, the French state not only
made grave concessions in order to achieve an illusory regeneration,
recuperate France’s sovereignty and restore its standing in the midst
of a war that had no end in sight and was assuming world-wide
proportions; in its desire to perpetuate its regime, it also drew closer
and closer to the occupier. Even if its slogan was ‘France for itself
alone’, the end result of its policies was to turn it into a steppingstone
for the criminal activities of Nazism. The occupier might
possibly have managed to deport as many Jews by giving direct
orders to the French police, as it did in the countries whose governments
were established in London. But the fact remains that Vichy
lent a hand by turning in foreign Jews, denaturalizing some French
Jews and arresting Jews with French nationality.<br><br>

It should not be imagined, however, that, without Vichy, there
would have been no collaboration. French society possessed mechanisms
of its own for accommodation. But the French state did confer a
legitimacy upon them, exerting an influence that, without being
unequivocal, was heavily negative. When one compares the situation
with that of the other occupied countries in Western Europe it
emerges, despite the diversity of their pasts and their national
contexts, that in respect of marked forms of political accommodation
- membership of collaborationist groups or commitment that
involved wearing the German uniform- France comes at the bottom
of the scale. The existence of the French state and above all the
popularity of Petain probably had a deflecting effect: in many cases 
the support given to Petain may have prevented more rad1cal
commitment. On the other hand, in its behaviour French society
does seem to have been more prone to opportunist accommodation,
for in this area the existence of Vichy had the opposite effect,
lending encouragement to interests in need of defence or promotion.
Although the other occupied societies of Western Europe
produced more supporters and recruits for collaborationism, they
at the same time provide examples of civil resistance the like of
which are not to be found in France: the Amsterdam strike in
support of the Jews, and in Holland and Norway the movements
of refusal to coperate on the part of academics and the medical
profession, etc.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[4]</a> These constituted demonstrations of opposition to
the local Nazis’ attempts to make those under occupation fall into
line; whereas in France the French state fostered an appearance of
legality that disarmed open rejection of this type.<br><br>

The years of occupation indubitably left a painful splinter lodged
in the memories of French people; for a cherished image of France
was damaged by all the compromising deals struck with one of the
worst regimes of modem Europe. The experience of the Second
World War overturned the glorious image of the Great War, which
had not only ended in victory, but had also produced a sacred unity
in times of tribulation. The defeat of 1940 toppled the institutions of
France and paved the way for a regime for which, right up until the
moment when it collapsed in infamy, the redefinition of a political
pact took pnonty over the salvation of the nation. Meanwhile over
the question of who it was that embodied political legitimacy and
the national interest, opinion had been deeply divided. In circumstances
such as those of an occupation, individual men and women
sometimes discover who they really are. But it is difficult for a whole
society to do so. France entered upon its trial pursuing a course that
it was hard to correct in the short term, despite the great figure of
one rebel general and all the sacrifices made by a minority of French
people.<br><br>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>


1. I am thinking, in particular, of the works of Jean-Pierre Azéma, Stanley Hoffman,
Eberhard Jäckel, H. R. Kedward, Pascal Ory, Robert Paxton, John Sweets and, of
course, the team at the Institut d’Histolre du Temps Présent. Among the many works
devoted to other countries occupied by Nazi Germany, I should like to single out
those by Gerhard Hirschfeld (<i>Fremdherrschaft und Kollaboration. Die Niederlande
unter deutscher Besatzung 1940-1945</i>. Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1984,
English translation, 1988) and Mark Mazower (<i>Inside Hitler’s Greece: the Experience
