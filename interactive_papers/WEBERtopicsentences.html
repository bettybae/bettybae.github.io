case 102: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ACTION FRANÇAISE (1899–1944),</b> nationalist and royalist movement of the extreme Right, influential in shaping the early phase of Vichy’s National Revolution. Led by Charles Maurras and spearheaded by its daily newspaper, <i>L’Action Française</i>, the movement became the avant-garde of the French nationalist Right in the decade before 1914. Mixing violent polemics and street brawling with serious political and literary commentary, the Action Française’s influence peaked in the years just after World War I, when its brand of nationalism was widely shared. Between the mid-1920s and the eve of World War II, the movement suffered a long, but gradual, period of decline hastened, first, by the Vatican’s condemnation in 1926, resulting in loss of Catholic support, and, second, by the steady defection of younger and more activist recruits to the radical leagues of the 1930s. However, the long-term impact of Maurrasian ideas proved to be significant, not only among the many “dissidents” who populated the more radical leagues of the 1930s but also across the spectrum of the nationalist Right. <br><br> Though the Action Française had been, from its earliest days, vehemently anti-German, by the late 1930s, it had become a leading force in the neopacifist campaign, culminating with its support of the Munich agreement. This paradox can be explained in terms of the alignment of ideological forces, both inside and outside France. Though Maurras had little sympathy for Nazism—which he saw as a variety of despised “Germanism”—he had even less sympathy for those who, he claimed, would benefit from a war against Hitler: the Soviet Union, French communists and their Popular Front allies, and Jews. Although the Action Française opposed the dreaded “ideological” war to the last day, when it was finally declared, the royalists supported its prosecution. The defeat of 1940, which brought in its wake the dismantling of the parliamentary Republic and the installation of Philippe Pétain as head of an authoritarian regime, seemed, at first, to open a new and promising phase in the movement’s history. Though the impact of the Action Française on Vichy’s National Revolution has sometimes been exaggerated, it was real, specifically because of the number of well-placed Maurrasians close to Pétain and, more generally, because Maurrasian ideas had had a shaping influence on the Catholic and reactionary Right through the years of the Third Republic. The laws, institutions, and moral tone of the Vichy government reflected long-standing royalist preferences: from the anti-Semitic laws to the emphasis on the ideals of order, hierarchy, corporation, and authority. Even though the royalist daily, published in Lyons, often criticized the slow pace of the National Revolution and its lax enforcement, it stood unwaveringly behind the figure of Pétain. This benefited the royalists early on, when Pétain’s popularity was almost universal; however, as his National Revolution proved increasingly hollow, and his decision to collaborate with the Nazi occupier increasingly disastrous, the Action Française, supporting its surrogate prince to the end, shared in the increasing disfavor directed against his government. Further, the Action Française’s habitually vicious attacks on selected groups and individuals—now focused on communists, Gaullists, and Jews—became, in some cases, tantamount to death sentences as officials, both German and French, hunted down their prey. Hence, when the Vichy regime went down in the flames of the Nazi defeat, the Action Française shared its fate. <br><br> *F.

case 106: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ALSACE-LORRAINE.</b> With the beginning of the war, on 1 September 1939, 230,000 Lorrainers and 275,000 Alsatians (including all of the residents of Strasbourg) were evacuated to southwestern France. Leaders of the various regional autonomist factions were rounded up and imprisoned at Nancy. The most compromised among them, Karl Roos, an agent of the German Sicherheitsdienst (security service, SD) was convicted of high treason and shot on 7 February 1940. <br><br> During the campaign of 1940, the Maginot Line forts stood firm, some holding out until the end of June, long after the armistice. Five days after the French artillery supporting the line was withdrawn, the German Seventh Army crossed the Rhine: Metz and Strasbourg fell on 17 and 19 June. The entire French bureaucracy in the three <i>départements </i>was arrested and expelled immediately. Operating on the lie that a secret clause in the armistice of 25 June had transferred control of Alsace and Lorraine from France to Germany, the Nazis promptly integrated the region into their own pre-1939 frontier districts. The Gauleiters (local leaders) were two party veterans, Joseph Bürckel for Westmark and Robert Wagner (né Backfisch) for Baden-Elsass. Despite a vigorous protest by Vichy delegates to the armistice commission at the end of August, the Germans continued their de facto incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine. The proceedings of the commission were secret, and the protest was not known in the region until mid-1941. Meanwhile, the belief that France had deliberately abandoned Alsace-Lorraine to its fate took root. <br><br> The first two years of German occupation were spent in applying the Nazi institutions to Alsace-Lorraine. The sharp loss in inhabitants through mass deportation (to unoccupied France or, in aggravated cases, “to the East”) was partially made up by the return of the evacuees from Périgord. The second period, from mid-1942 to liberation at the end of November 1944, was that of rupture between occupier and the indigenous population. The Nazis had promised in 1940 that Alsace-Lorraine would never have to fight in the ongoing war. Suddenly, the conscription of all males between the ages of 16 and 34 was decreed on 25 August 1942. A whole new class was created overnight: the <i>Malgré-Nous </i>(Against Our Will). Despite riots and widespread defiance, 105,000 Alsatians and 35,000 Lorrainers went to the eastern front, of whom some 40,000 never returned. [Editor’s note: estimates of the numbers of Alsatians and Lorrainers killed vary because of the difficult immediate postwar conditions in France and the reluctance of the Soviet Union to supply information after 1945; see Autonomists.] <br><br> The development and extension of Resistance cells and networks in Alsace- Lorraine kept pace with the increasing repression. Many escaped to Switzerland, the most notable being General Henri Giraud in April 1942. Liberation came when General Philippe Leclerc, leading his own French Second Armored Division and three American infantry units, cracked the central Vosges defenses on 22 November 1944. The following day, his forces quickly liberated Strasbourg and the territories extending north to the Palatinate and south to the outskirts of Colmar. As General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny’s First French Army entered Mulhouse at the same time, the war seemed over, although a southern feint in the desperate German counterattack in the Ardennes nearly recaptured Strasbourg. <br><br> Alsace-Lorraine was quickly purged of collaborators: the number of death sentences was the highest in liberated France, but more commutations were also handed down because of the “special circumstances” of German rule in the region. Adjustment to renewed French rule was complicated by popular resentment over the apparent abandonment by the Vichy regime and by the involvement of several adolescent <i>Malgré-Nous </i>in the 1944 massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane. The nightmare of occupation, however, had underscored the pricelessness of the political freedom for which the French Republic, whatever its faults, had always stood. <br><br> *P. C. F.

case 107: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ANTI-SEMITISM,</b> an integral component of Vichy ideology, was manifest in the systematic persecution of French and foreign-born Jews. Holding Jews to blame for the “decadence” of the Third Republic and for dragging France into war, Vichy authorities acted independently of the Germans to deprive Jews of their civil liberties and cooperated with the Germans in the confiscation of Jewish property and the internment and deportation of Jews from France. The <i>Statut des Juifs </i>of 3 October 1940 prohibited Jews from holding positions of authority in the military, the civil service, education, and the press. Subsequent laws, including a second <i>Statut des Juifs </i>in June 1941, extended these prohibitions and restricted Jewish access to higher education and the liberal professions. As of June 1941, Jews could constitute no more than 3 percent of all secondary and postsecondary education students and no more than 2 percent of lawyers (July 1941), doctors, midwives, and pharmacists (August 1941), architects (September 1941), and dentists (June 1942). Administration of these initiatives was the responsibility of the Commissariat générale des questions juives (CGQJ), established in March 1941. <br><br> A German ordinance of 18 October 1940 required that all but the smallest Jewish businesses in the occupied zone be placed under trusteeship. Vichy responded by creating the Service de contrôle des administrateurs provisoires (SCAP) to guarantee that French trustees assume responsibility for managing, selling, or liquidating Jewish property. A law of 2 July 1941 extended the Aryanization of Jewish property to the unoccupied zone. Unemployment and the Aryanization of Jewish property created widespread Jewish impoverishment. Jewish philanthropic organizations attempted to meet the needs of destitute Jews independently but were thwarted by the Germans and Vichy, which in November 1941 created the Union générale des Israélites de France (UGIF). Subsumed under the authority of the CGQJ and responsible for the social welfare of Jews resident in France, the UGIF had to register all Jews resident in the occupied zone and supervise the internment of Jews in concentration camps throughout France. <br><br> As of 4 October 1940 Vichy had the authority to intern foreign-born Jews; three days later it revoked the citizenship of Algerian Jews. Within weeks there were 50,000 Jews interned in concentration camps throughout France and in North Africa. On 2 June 1941 Vichy authorized the internment of any Jew, whether foreign-born or French. After the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 determined how many Jews each region of occupied Europe would have to deport to extermination camps, the German occupation authorities in France demanded that Vichy cooperate in the arrest and deportation of 100,000 Jews. After 29 May 1942, Jews over the age of six residing in the occupied zone had to wear the yellow star; by midsummer they were denied access to most public places, allowed to ride only on the last car on the Métro, and forced to shop only during designated hours. The ordinance requiring Jews to wear the yellow star and the arrest of 12,884 Jews, rounded up in the Vélodrome d’hiver, a bicycle-race stadium, in Paris on 16–17 July 1942 provoked civil and religious protests throughout France. Nonetheless, by the end of 1942, 42,500 Jews (including 6,000 children) had been deported. On 11 December 1942 Vichy required all Jews to carry identification papers stamped “Juif.” Because Jews in the previously unoccupied zone were not required to wear the yellow star, in 1943, when the Gestapo boarded trains and raided cities in the south of France in search of Jews, the identification papers helped them to find their quarry. Although Pierre Laval refused to cooperate when Germany demanded that France revoke the citizenship of Jews naturalized since 1927, Vichy did little else to impede the Final Solution. Of the 75,721 Jews deported from France, two-thirds were foreign-born, who had sought refuge in France; one-third were French citizens. Only 2,500 (3 percent) of the deportees survived. <br><br> *†J.

case 281: $("div#commentary").html('<b>DALADIER, ÉDOUARD (1884–1970),</b> was premier, 1938–1940, and war minister, 1936–1940. In France many hoped that Daladier could be the Georges Clemenceau or Raymond Poincaré to lead the nation against Nazi Germany. Daladier, known to many as “Dala” or the “Bull of the Vaucluse,” the electoral district that he represented, was reputed to be a man of action who could unite the French against the Nazi menace. “A bull, with snail’s horns,” commented Neville Chamberlain, who himself was hardly a paragon of firmness against Nazi Germany. Daladier’s reputation exceeded his talents; often full of fight at first, then equivocating and capitulating. <br><br>During the war of 1914–1918, Daladier received a field commission and was cited for valor. In the 1920s he rose to prominence in the Radical Party, leaning left with Radical young Turks and willing to work with the socialists. In 1936 he was one of the main leaders of the Popular Front. He succeeded Blum as premier in April 1938 and went to Munich in September 1938 to condone the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Some say Daladier had no choice; others say that he failed to support the <i>bellicistes </i>in his cabinet. He turned against the Communist Party and broke up the Popular Front in November 1938, crushing a general strike against government take-backs of gains made in 1936. Daladier opposed strengthening the Franco–Soviet mutual assistance pact (1935); opposed Franco–Soviet military staff talks (1936–1938); and did not pursue with sufficient energy an Anglo–Franco–Soviet alliance in 1939, instructing his chief delegate to staff talks in Moscow (August 1939) not to agree to Red Army passage across Poland to fight the enemy. <br><br>After September 1939 Daladier quarreled with Paul Reynaud and stubbornly defended General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin against charges of failing to pursue the war with sufficient vigor. Daladier resigned as premier in March 1940, as his reputation and political power crumbled. After the French collapse in June 1940, he was arrested and imprisoned until the end of the war. <br><br>*M. Alexander, <i>The Republic in Danger </i>(Cambridge, U.K., 1992); J.

case 500: $("div#commentary").html('<b>KÉRILLIS, HENRI DE (1889–1958),</b> was an interwar journalist, elected as a deputy in 1936, who tried to form a broad-based conservative movement. Opposed to Nazi Germany, he was the only right-wing deputy who, joining one socialist and 75 communists, voted against the 1938 Munich agreement. Rejecting the 1940 armistice and hunted by the Gestapo, Kérillis fled to the United States, where he initially supported General de Gaulle but believed that the general should limit himself to military activity on behalf of the Allies while staying out of politics, a view shared by about a third of the French exiles in the United States. With other such “dissident” journalists, including Geneviève Tabouis and Pertinax (André Géraud), Kérillis founded a newspaper, <i>Pour la Victoire</i>, in January 1942. In a 1945 book entitled <i>De Gaulle dictateur</i>, he later expanded his view of the general as a political usurper. Following the Allied landings in North Africa, November 1942, Kérillis supported the State Department’s attempts to marginalize de Gaulle by dealing with first Admiral Darlan, then General Henri Giraud. Kérillis’ violent articles against de Gaulle in <i>Pour la Victoire </i>were opposed by the American Gaullist organization France Forever. Kérillis greeted the creation of the Comité Français de Libération Nationale in 1943 with a passionate campaign, in which he wrote that, actually hampering the liberation of France, “de Gaulle had installed in Algiers the most dictatorial constitution that France had ever known.” Following the liberation, Kérillis, preferring direct American military rule to de Gaulle, argued that France no longer had a legal government. <br><br>Kérillis and his colleagues, including Alexis Léger, in large measure agreed with Roosevelt, fearing the dictatorial power of de Gaulle, whom they saw as a military man, nationalistic, ambitious, and antidemocratic, with no popular investiture. In addition, however, Kérillis had a son, who had joined Free France, was parachuted into France, then was caught and tortured to death by Gestapo agents. Kérillis accused de Gaulle’s secret services of having denounced his son. This episode helped justify and sharpened Kérillis’ already virulent anti- Gaullism.

<b>Epigram</b><br><br><blockquote>It

<b>First Paragraph</b><br><br>

THIS IS NOT <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-500"><b>Henri de Kérillis</b></a> speaking but Thucydides’ 
version of the Corinthian ambassadors’ talking the Spartans into going to war against an aggressive Athens. It is also a good description of the mood in which the French 
faced a formidable enemy.<br><br>

<b>Last Paragraph</b><br><br>

Only the British refused to understand. “<i>Everyone</i> at Vichy, whatever their political views, was 
convinced that they would fold.” There were few in France who, if and when they thought, did not think like Vichy. The 
Germans behaved correctly, harmed no one, paid for their purchases in cash. The three cannon shots of June 26 announcing 
the official end of hostilities were welcome, but the country had laid down its arms at least a week before. <i>Paris-Soir</i> 
(a German-controlled edition) suggested what the summer should be about: couture, aperitifs, and shopping. On July 6 the Casino 
de Paris reopened its portals to the public. On the stage door a new notice hung: ENTRANCE PROHIBITED TO DOGS AND JEWS.<br><br>
