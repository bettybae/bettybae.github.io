	<p><b>Introduction </b></p>

	<p><b>Background and context </b></p>

	<p>This book seeks to introduce the reader to an important and highly controversial period of French history: world war and occupation. It is a short but intriguing era: one that is constantly being revisited by historians and one that has an enduring appeal for students. It is a period that keeps throwing up important debates and one that refuses to go away (its legacy has been particularly evident throughout the 1980s and 1990s—as we will discover in Chapter 5). It also incorporates a fascinating array of themes: fascism, war, collaboration, resistance, and civil war. </p>

	<p>It may be helpful here to sketch out the main contours of the period under consideration. France entered the Second World War in 1939 but within months she had suffered a catastrophic military reverse at the hands of Germany. In June 1940 the Franco-German Armistice was signed; and after the defeat-induced collapse of the Third Republic, Marshal Philippe Pétain assumed power. With Germany occupying the north of France—including Paris—the ‘independent’ French government moved first to Bordeaux and then to Vichy. </p>

	<p>For the first two years or so, the Vichy administration had some autonomy, but after 1942 and the German invasion of the southern zone all this changed and the occupiers were, effectively, in control of the whole country. While they had some leeway to govern, Pétain and a succession of right-hand men—most famously, Laval—initiated a range of policies. The showcase development was the National Revolution. In the three spheres of ‘<i>travail, famille, patrie</i>’, the Vichy administration attempted to return France—or the southern zone at least—to its traditionalist past. And, in a voluntary manner, it also agreed to co-operate with the German occupiers in a range of areas. Most horrifically, the Pétain-led administration played its part in the Holocaust. Although there is much debate as to the exact role of France and the French in this initiative, it is clear that Pétain, Laval and others were, for the most part, willing accomplices in the project. </p>

	<p>At the same time, a myriad of groups—both inside and outside France—were forming and evolving with the explicit aim of resisting the German presence in France and opposing the Vichy regime. Outside France resistance took the form of de Gaulle’s Free French movement; inside, it had a million and one different incarnations: from the highly organised Communist Party, through an array of smaller political organisations, to the anarchic and terroristic Maquis movement and to individuals up and down the country who expressed their dissatisfaction, hurt and anger at the German occupation in many and various ways. (As we will discover, it is extremely hard to generalise: there were as many different types of resistance as there were resisters; the same could also be said of collaboration.) </p>

	<p>Ultimately, these forces, in tandem with the Allied powers, were able to help extricate France from the despair and shame of the Occupation. And in 1944, through the Liberation—so full of hope, but also so full of problems—France emerged, at last, from the trauma of world war and the Occupation. But in what state did she emerge? Other questions will also challenge us over the forthcoming pages. For example: What factors explain the Fall of France? Why was France occupied? Which political ideas and values did the Vichy regime embody? Why did France collaborate? And, moving on to other important aspects of the wartime period: Who resisted, and why? What were the main social and economic consequences of the war? Who liberated France? How should we think about, and interpret, the legacy of the Occupation period? These questions and debates will preoccupy us—just as they have preoccupied a host of post-war writers. It is no surprise that the Occupation period has provoked historians and commentators so pointedly. In the early days—during the war and just following it—the literature on the period was, not unnaturally, highly politicised. On the whole it was devoid of real hindsight and balance. In the two or three decades after the Liberation, and as the Gaullist ‘resistance myth’ came into conflict with the less charitable myth of France as ‘a nation of collaborators’, there was little of a challenging nature written about the Occupation period. There was Aron’s history of Vichy<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> and a whole range of de Gaulle-centred histories, starting with his memoirs and moving on to a variety of biographical studies; but for most of the time, with the myth of France as ‘a nation of resisters’ still prominent, and with post-war France generally unable, or unwilling, to face up to the unpleasant reality of the era, it could be argued that the political climate was not exactly conducive to genuine historical enquiry.</p>
	
	<p>This, however, began to change in the 1970s. <i>The Sorrow and the Pity</i>—a documentary film which challenged, in an explicit fashion, the validity of the Gaullist myth—appeared at the start of the decade,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> as did Paxton’s ground-breaking study of Pétain’s regime, <i>Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order 1940–1944</i>. In his introduction to this book, Paxton talks about the way in which the 1970s heralded a ‘new curiosity’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> about the Vichy regime and witnessed a significant opening-up of official archives. With the ascension of the socialist Mitterrand to the presidency in 1981 <i>and</i> with the further passing of time, the climate seemed to change for the better. A void appeared to open up; and into it, with relish, appeared historians like Hoffman (Vichy), Kedward (the Resistance), Halls (Vichy youth movements), Kuisel (the economy), Marrus and Paxton (the Jews), Collins Weitz (women), Burrin (the Occupation) and Rousso (Vichy and memory). A new wave of war trials (Barbie, Bousquet, Touvier and Papon) and a fresh outpouring of literature and cinematic work also seemed to be symptomatic of the new climate. And, as one might suspect, this new surge in artistic work and historical enquiry did not please everyone.

	<p>To comprehend the wartime period, however, one must first appreciate the climactic nature of the Fall of France—described variously as a ‘debacle’, a ‘disaster’ and a ‘catastrophe’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> In essence, the fall of France is an umbrella term that covers both military and political demise.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> It centres on a series of key events in 1940:

	<blockquote>10 May&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGermany invades the Low Countries.<br>
	13–14 May&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe French front is broken on the Meuse.<br>
	18 May&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReynaud becomes Minister of National Defence in place of <b>[PAGE 2]</b> Daladier.<br>

	29 May–4 June&nbspThe evacuation from Dunkirk.<br>
	10 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe French government moves to Touraine; Italy enters the war.<br>
	14 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Germans enter Paris; the French government moves to Bordeaux.<br>
	16 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe resignation of Reynaud and succession of Pétain.<br>
	18 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGeneral de Gaulle calls from London for continued resistance.<br>
	22 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Armistice with Germany.<br>
	24 June&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Armistice with Italy.<br>
	1 July&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe French government moves to Vichy.<br>
	3 July&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir.<br>
	10 July&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe National Assembly votes full powers to Pétain.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a></blockquote>

	<p>It is extremely difficult to analyse the Fall of France in 1940 without making reference to the political and economic tribulations of the previous decades, and so an understanding of the inter-war years is crucial to an overall analysis of 1940. Of course, at the root of it, the Fall of France was a disastrous military episode, but it is also wrapped in social, economic, political and perhaps even psychological significance.</p>

	<p>The Great Depression and the Crash of 1929, together with fascist riots in 1934 and the emergence of the Popular Front in 1936, helped to create a weak and divided France—a France torn by left-right tension and prone to extremism on both flanks of the political spectrum. As a consequence, it could be argued that France’s foreign policy and international standing was affected adversely and thus, that in 1940, she was not ready to stand up to Germany.</p>

	<p>This, of course, was most obvious on the military plane. Cobban states that the defeat of France in 1940 was a military defeat pure and simple and that the collapse of the nation was synonymous with this.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> The argument here is straightforward: bad organisation, out-of-date military tactics and a general unpreparedness led, extremely rapidly, to defeat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Mixed in with this, many historians allege, was a tremendously blasé attitude: a belief that, somehow, trench warfare could triumph over <i>blitzkrieg</i>, and also that defence spending did not have to respond to political developments in Germany. On this last point, it is interesting to note that expenditure on defence actually <i>fell</i> in the 12 months following Hitler’s accession to the chancellorship. And even though it rose in <b>[PAGE 3]</b> 1935, the damage seemed to have been done; and perhaps more importantly, the French establishment had revealed its rather backward and unenlightened attitude.</p>

	<p>It is easy to detect a definite arrogance in the stance taken by the French authorities. Many people seemed to take the view that because France emerged a victor in 1918 she would do so again—without much effort—in the second major world conflict of the century. In this sense, it is argued by some that, for France, a victory was much harder to overcome than a defeat. The nation and its people had claimed a massive triumph after Versailles—but at the same time they had failed to realise that it was the USA’s contribution to the First World War that had been decisive and that France herself had been desperately weakened by the conflict. In crude terms, France—post–1918—was living in a fantasy world: she was far weaker than she actually thought she was. Horne argues that the Maginot line—and more significantly, the ‘Maginot line mentality’—was a particularly unfortunate symptom of France’s inter-war attitude.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> This is where the psychological dimension to the country’s malaise clearly becomes apparent: a dimension that should not be underestimated.</p>

	<p>It could also be argued, quite strongly, that France’s foreign policy<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> in the period 1919–39 was weak and incoherent. Part of the problem was that her diplomatic stance was constantly changing: from strong anti-Germanism in the immediate post-war period to the desire for ‘mutual guarantees’ in the late 1920s; and from the early–1930s, quest for security in the face of Hitler to appeasement in the latter half of the decade. Foreign policy-making was schizophrenic—there was no real consistency and no convincing central thrust. As Cobban points out, France was impotent in the face of Nazi adventurism and increasingly over-dependent on Great Britain in particular in the diplomatic sphere. He also claims that in the inter-war period the nation was divided on everything except the need to avoid a second world conflict—sadly ironic given the course of history after 1939.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> There was certainly a strong defeatist feel to French foreign policy in the pre-war years; diplomatic impotence was a definite symptom of demise and decline, and ultimately foreshadowed military defeat and political collapse. The sense of domestic crisis in 1930s’ France was also a key contributory factor. The right’s interpretation of the Fall of France rests almost exclusively on the belief that 1940 was the ‘fault’ of the Third Republic and the politicians who, in their eyes, came to personify it. At the time, this argument was advanced by Pétain. His main claim was that the disaster of 1940 was merely the reflection of the Third Republic’s political defects on a military plane. Many aspects of the post-1871 regime were condemned: the ‘excessive’ power of parliament over government, the adverse effects of proportional representation, and the continual instability brought on by regular elections and changes in government. Away from the polemic and rhetoric implicit in the right’s critique, there was some substance to the attack. For instance, between 1914 and 1940 there were numerous changes in prime minister. As a result, it was alleged, France lacked the opportunity to develop long-term policy perspectives in a whole range of spheres.</p>
	
	<p>It is also undeniable that inter-war France was beset by terrible political feuding and in-fighting. It was a divided society, but also a polarised one. On the left, there was a real awakening: in 1924 the <i>Cartel des gauches</i> gained power and 12 years later the <i>Front populaire</i> entered government. On the right, there was a profound radicalisation: the growth of the fascist <i>ligues</i>—and the events of 6 February 1934—signifying a serious <b>[PAGE 4]</b> new threat to the Republic. Pétain’s claim was that France was divided and unstable, and thus could not possibly prevent, or cope with, a situation like 1940. For him, politicians and the infrastructure of the Third Republic were to blame; his ‘solution’ was firm, executive and almost monarchical government.</p>
	
	<p>Another view is that national economic decline prepared the way for military defeat, even if it did not directly cause it. The view here is that economic stagnation in the interwar period created a situation in which France was unwilling, and perhaps unable, to make a stand against Germany; military defeat and political collapse followed on. There were disturbing signs: imports had outgrown exports, tourism was declining, the franc was falling, and the country’s dependence on reparations was increasing (in a period when Germany was endeavouring to pay less and less). There was also population stagnation—an extremely serious development in a country that had always established a definite link between reproduction levels and national prowess. All these trends were serious in themselves but together, in economic and psychological terms, they had a devastating effect on France’s national health.</p>
	
	<p>This book will explore, and synthesise, the main secondary writings on the Occupation period; in certain places too, the spotlight will shift to key primary sources. The structure of the book will be thematic, although where appropriate the period’s chronology will be high-lighted. In Chapter 1, the Occupation—the backdrop to collaboration and resistance—will be examined as a social, economic and political phenomenon. As such, this section will explore the everyday reality of the Occupation and the main economic and societal trends at play.</p>
	
	<p>In the following two chapters the ‘high’ politics of the period will be explored. In Chapter 2, the Vichy regime and the policy of collaboration will be assessed. These two topics are, arguably, the most contentious aspects of the Occupation era. In Chapter 3, the phenomenon of resistance will come under the spotlight. What were the different types of resistance? Who were the resisters? What was the ideology of resistance? Throughout, we will be very conscious of the fact that there was never, really, one such thing called ‘the Resistance’.</p>
	
	<p>In Chapter 4, the focus will shift to the Liberation. Here there is one dominant, and crucial, debate: who liberated France? This historical controversy will be looked at in detail. A picture of the Liberation era will be painted via the many important themes at play in the elongated period that was the Liberation. The last section—Chapter 5—will take a different slant on the wartime period: its legacy. The ramifications of the period for post-war France should not be underestimated. It has left an indelible stain on the psyche of modern France—a stain that is still extremely evident.</p>
