			case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<b>Léopold Sédar Senghor</b> (1906-2001) was a prominent figure in shaping the fate of Africa after the end of WWII and the end of European colonialism. As one of the founders of the ‘Négritude’ movement along with <b>Aimé Césaire</b> and <b>Léon Damas</b> in 1930s and 40s, he strongly advocated and affirmed the value of black African arts, as well as politics <sup>1</sup>. Born between a Serer (a West African ethno-religious group) father and a Catholic mother, <b>Senghor</b> throughout his life attempted to incorporate into Christianity the African “local culture, language and even worldview” <sup>2</sup>. He was educated in France under scholarship and was drafted into the French Resistance in 1939, where he was captured a year later and was forced to spend two years in Nazi Concentration Camps <sup>3</sup>. In those camps he wrote numerous poems, including <i>Camp 1940</i>.<br><br>>He was one of the first to oppose the Independence Act from France; instead, he was supportive of an “alliance between French Equatorial Africa and French West Sudan” that would save Africa from “the proliferation of small unviable states” imposed by France through its focus on “territorial rather than federal government” <sup>4</sup>. This led to the short-lived Mali Federation in 1959, with <b>Senghor</b> as the leader. Though he would then later become the first president of independent Senegal in 1960, Senghor asserted that, between his accomplishments as “a poet, a thinker or a statesman”, he most wanted to be remembered as a poet <sup>5</sup>, showing the extent to which his poetic mind shaped his political actions. Forever a pacifist, Senghor attempted through his writing and politics to find a hybrid movement that juxtaposed African traditions with French modernity. <br><br><b>References</b><br><br><sup>1</sup> Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v.

	<p><b> <p> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[ Léopold Sédar Senghor]</a>, “Camp 1940” (Front Stalag 230, ca. 1940-1942) </p> </b>
<p> <i> For Abdoulaye Ly </i> </p>
Ravaged the garden of betrothal in a sudden tornado evening<br>
Mown down the white lilacs, faded, the fragrance of lily-of-the valley<br>
Departed the fiancees for the Islands of breeze and the Rivers of the South. <br>
A cry of disaster has pierced from end to end the cool land of wines and songs<br>
Like a swordblade of thunder in its heart, from the East to the West<br>
This is a vast village of mud and branches, a village crucified by two plague ditches.<br>
Hatreds and hunger ferment here in the torpor of a mortal summer<br>
It is a great village encircled by the motionless hostility of the barbed wire<br>
A great village under the tyranny of four itchy machine-guns.<br>
And the noble warriors beg for cigarette-ends<br>
They fight the dogs for the bones, they fight each other for dream dogs and cats<br>
But They alone have kept the frankness of their laughter, they alone the freedom of their soul of fire.<br>
And evening falls, a sob of blood that liberates the night. <br>
They watch over the big pink children, their big blond children, their big white children<br>
Who turn and turn again in their sleep, possessed by the fleas of anxiety and the lice of captivity. <br>
The stories of black night-watches cradle them, and the solemn voices that espouse the pathways of silence<br>
And the lullabies gently, lullabies with no tom-tom and with no pounding of black hands <br>
–That will be for tomorrow, at siesta hour, the mirage of epic poems<br>
And the sun’s ride over the white savannas with their limitless sands.<br>
And the wind is a guitar in the trees, the barbed wire is more melodious than harp strings<br>
And the roofs bend low listen, the stars smile with their sleepless eyes<br>
–Up there up there, their countenance is blue-black.<br> 
The air grows tender in the village of mud and branches <br>
And the earth grows human like the sentries, the roads invite them to freedom. <br>
They will not go. They will not desert their fatigues nor their joyful duty.<br> 
Who will do the shameful chores if not those who are born noble? <br>
Who then will dance on Sundays to the tom-tom sounds of cans? <br>
And are they not free with the freedom of destiny?<br> 
Ravaged the garden of betrothal in a sudden tornado evening <br>
Mown down the white lilacs, faded the fragrance of lily-of-the-valley <br>
Departed the fiancées for the Islands of breeze and the Rivers of the South.<br>
