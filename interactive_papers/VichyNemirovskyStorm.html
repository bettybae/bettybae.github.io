<b>[p.1]</b> <br><br> <h2>ONE</h2> <h2>Storm in June</h2> <br><br>  <b>[p.3]</b> <br><br><b><h2>1</h2></b><b><h2>War</h2></b><br><br> 
Hot, thought the Parisians. The warm air of spring. It was night, they were at war and there was an air 
raid. But dawn was near and the war far away. The first to hear the hum of the siren were those who couldn’t 
sleep-the ill and bedridden, mothers with sons at the front, women crying for the men they loved. To them it 
began as a long breath, like air being forced into a deep sigh. It wasn’t long before its wailing filled the sky. 
It came from afar, from beyond the horizon, slowly, almost lazily. Those still asleep dreamed of waves breaking over pebbles, 
a March storm whipping the woods, a herd of cows trampling the ground with their hooves, until finally sleep was shaken off and 
they struggled to open their eyes, murmuring, “Is it an air raid?” <br><br> The women, more 
anxious, more alert, were already up, although some of them, after closing the windows and shutters, went back to bed. The night before-Monday, 3 June-bombs had fallen on Paris for the first time since the beginning of the war.
 Yet everyone remained calm. Even though the reports were terrible, no one believed them. No more so than if victory had 
been announced. “We don’t understand what’s happening,” people said. <br><br> They had to dress their children by 
torchlight. Mothers lifted small, warm, heavy bodies into their arms: “Come on, don’t be afraid, don’t cry.” 
An air raid. All the lights were out, but beneath the clear, golden June sky, every house, every street was 
visible. As for the Seine, the river seemed to absorb even the faintest glimmers of light and reflect them back a hundred times 
brighter, like some multifaceted mirror. Badly blacked-out windows, glistening rooftops, the metal hinges of doors all shone in the 
water. There were a few red lights that stayed on longer than the others, no one knew why, and the <b>[p.4]</b> Seine drew them in, capturing them and bouncing them playfully on its waves. From above, 
it could be seen flowing along, as white as a river of milk. It guided the enemy planes, some people thought. 
Others said that couldn’t be so. In truth, no one really knew anything. “I’m staying in bed,” sleepy voices murmured, “I’m not scared.” “All the same, it just takes one ... “ the more sensible replied. <br><br> Through the windows that ran along the service stairs in new apartment blocks, little flashes of light could be seen descending: the 
people living on the sixth floor were fleeing the upper storeys; they held their torches in front of them, in spite of the 
regulations. “Do you think I want to fall on my face on the stairs! Are you coming, Emile?” Everyone instinctively 
lowered their voices as if the enemy’s eyes and ears were everywhere. One after another, doors slammed shut. In the poorer neighbourhoods 
there was always a crowd in the Metro, or the foul-smelling shelters. The wealthy simply went to sit with the concierge, straining to hear the shells bursting and the explosions that meant bombs were falling, their bodies as tense as frightened animals in dark 
woods as the hunter gets closer. Though the poor were just as afraid as the rich, and valued their lives just as much, they were more sheeplike: they needed one another, needed to link arms, to groan or laugh together. <br><br> Day was breaking. A silvery blue light slid over the cobblestones, over the parapets along the quayside, over the towers 
of Notre-Dame. Bags of sand were piled halfway up all the important monuments, encircling Carpeaux’s dancers on the façade of the 
Opera House, silencing the Marseillaise on the Arc de Triomphe. <br><br> Still at some distance, great guns were 
firing; they drew nearer, and every window shuddered in reply. In hot rooms with blacked-out windows, children were born, and their cries made the women forget the sound of sirens and war. To the dying, the barrage of gunfire seemed far 
away, without any meaning whatsoever, just one more element in that vague, menacing whisper that washes over those on the brink of 
death. Children slept peacefully, held tight against their mothers’ sides, their lips making sucking noises, like little lambs. Street sellers’ 
carts lay abandoned, full of fresh flowers. <br><br> The sun came up, fiery red, in a cloudless 
sky. A shell was fired, <b>[p.5]</b> now so close to Paris that from the top 
of every monument birds rose into the sky. Great black birds, rarely seen at other times, stretched out their pink-tinged 
wings. Beautiful fat pigeons cooed; swallows wheeled; sparrows hopped peacefully in the deserted streets. Along the Seine each poplar tree held 
a cluster of little brown birds who sang as loudly as they could. From deep beneath the ground came the muffled noise everyone had 
been waiting for, a sort of three-tone fanfare. The air raid was over. <br><br> <b>[p.6]</b> <br><br><h2>2</h2><br><br> In the Péricand household they listened in 
shocked silence to the evening news on the radio, but no one passed comment on the latest developments. The Péricands were a cultivated 
family: their traditions, their way of thinking, their middle-class, Catholic background, their ties with the Church (their 
eldest son, Philippe Péricand, was a priest), all these things made them mistrustful of the government of France. On the other 
hand, Monsieur Péricand’s position as curator of one of the country’s national museums bound them to an administration that showered its faithful with honours 
and financial rewards. <br><br> A cat held a little piece of bony fish tentatively between its sharp teeth. He 
was afraid to swallow it, but he couldn’t bring himself to spit it out either. <br><br> Madame Péricand finally 
decided that only a male mind could explain with clarity such strange, serious events. Neither her husband nor her eldest son was at 
home: her husband was dining with friends, her son was not in Paris. Charlotte Péricand, who ruled the family’s daily life 
with an iron hand (whether it was managing the household, her children’s education or her husband’s career), was not in the habit 
of seeking anyone’s opinion. But this was of a different order. She needed a voice of authority to tell her what to believe. Once pointed in the right direction, there would be no stopping her. Even if given absolute proof she was mistaken, she 
would reply with a cold, condescending smile, “My father said so ... My husband is very well-informed.” And she 
would make a dismissive little gesture with her gloved hand. <br><br> She took pride in her husband’s position (she 
herself would have preferred a more domestic lifestyle, but following the example of our Dear Saviour, each of us has his cross to 
bear). She had come home <b>[p.7]</b> between appointments to oversee her children’s studies, the baby’s 
bottles and the servants’ work, but she didn’t have time to take off her hat and coat. For as long as the Péricand 
children could remember, their mother was always ready to go out, armed with hat and white gloves. (Since she was thrifty, her mended gloves had the faint smell of stain remover, a reminder of their passage through the dry-cleaners.) <br><br> As soon as she had come in this evening, she had gone to stand in front of the radio in the 
drawing room. Her clothes were black, her hat a divine little creation in fashion that season, decorated with three flowers and topped 
with a silk pom-pom. Beneath it, her face was pale and anguished, emphasising the marks of age and fatigue. 
She was forty-seven years old and had five children. You would have thought, to look at her, that God had 
intended her to be a redhead. Her skin was extremely delicate, lined by the passing years. Freckles were dotted over her strong, majestic nose. The expression in her green eyes was as sharp as a cat’s. At the last minute, however, it 
seemed that Providence had wavered, or decided that a shock of red hair would not be appropriate, neither to Madame Péricand’s irreproachable 
morals nor to her social status, so she had been given mousy brown hair, which she was losing by the handful since she’d 
had her last child. Monsieur Péricand was a man of great discipline: his religious scruples prohibited a number of pleasures and his concern 
for his reputation kept him away from places of ill repute. The youngest Péricand child was only two, and between Father Philippe and 
the baby, there were three other children, not counting the ones Madame Péricand discreetly referred to as the “three accidents”: babies she 
had carried almost to term before losing them, so that three times their mother had been on the verge of death. <br><br> The drawing room, where the radio was now playing, was enormous and well-proportioned, with four windows overlooking 
the Boulevard Delessert. It was furnished in traditional style, with large armchairs and settees upholstered in golden yellow. Next to the balcony, the elder Monsieur Péricand sat in his wheelchair. He was an invalid whose advancing age meant that he sometimes lapsed back into childhood 
and only truly returned to his right mind when discussing <b>[p.8] </b> his fortune, which was 
considerable (he was a Péricand-Maltête, heir of the Maltête family of Lyon). But the war, with its trials and 
tribulations, no longer affected him. He listened, indifferent, steadily nodding his beautiful silvery beard. The children stood in a semi
-circle behind their mother, the youngest in his nanny’s arms. Nanny had three sons of her own at the front. She 
had brought the little boy downstairs to say goodnight to his family and took advantage of her brief entry into the drawing room to listen 
anxiously to what they were saying on the radio. <br><br> The door was slightly ajar and Madame Péricand could sense 
the presence of the other servants outside. Madeleine, the maid, was so beside herself with worry that she came right up to 
the doorway. To Madame Péricand, such a breach of the normal rules seemed a frightening indication of things to come. It was 
in just this manner that the different social classes all ended up on the top deck during a shipwreck. But working-class people 
were highly strung. “How they do get carried away,” Madame Péricand thought reproachfully. She was one of those middle-class 
women who generally trust the lower classes. “They’re not so bad if you know how to deal with them,” she would say 
in the same condescending and slightly sad tone she used to talk of a caged animal. She was proud that she kept her servants 
for a long time. She insisted on looking after them when they were ill. When Madeleine had had a sore throat, Madame 
Péricand herself had prepared her gargle. Since she had no time to administer it during the day, she had waited until she got 
back from the theatre in the evening. Madeleine had woken up with a start and had only expressed her gratitude afterwards, and even 
then, rather coldly in Madame Péricand’s opinion. Well, that’s the lower classes for you, never satisfied, and the more you 
go out of your way to help them, the more ungrateful and moody they are. But Madame Péricand expected no reward except from 
God. <br><br> She turned towards the shadowy figures in the hallway and said with great kindness, “You may come 
and listen to the news if you like.” <br><br> “Thank you, Madame,” the servants murmured respectfully 
and slipped into the room on tiptoe. <br><br> <b> [p.9] </b> <br><br> They all came in: Madeleine; Marie; Auguste, the valet and finally Maria, the cook, embarrassed 
because her hands smelled of fish. But the news was over. Now came the commentaries on the situation: “Serious, of course, but not alarming,” the speaker assured everyone. He spoke in a voice so full, so calm, so effortless, 
and used such a resonant tone each time he said the words “France,” “Homeland” and “Army,” that he instilled hope in 
the hearts of his listeners. He had a particular way of reading such communiques as “The enemy is continuing relentless attacks on our positions 
but is encountering the most valiant resistance from our troops.” He said the first part of the sentence in a soft, ironic, scornful tone of voice, as if to imply, “At least that’s what they’d like us to think.” But in the 
second part he stressed each syllable, hammering home the adjective “valiant” and the words “our troops” with such confidence that people couldn’t help thinking, “Surely there’s no reason to worry so much!” <br><br> Madame Péricand saw the questioning, hopeful stares directed 
towards her. “It doesn’t seem absolutely awful to me!” she said confidently. Not that she believed it; she just felt 
it was her duty to keep up morale. <br><br> Maria and Madeleine let out a sigh. <br><br> “You think so, Madame?” <br><br> Hubert, the second-eldest son, a boy of 
seventeen with chubby pink cheeks, seemed the only one struck with despair and amazement. He dabbed nervously at his neck with a crumpled
-up handkerchief and shouted in a voice that was so piercing it made him hoarse, “It isn’t possible! It isn’t possible that 
it’s come to this! But, Mummy, what has to happen before they call everyone up? Right away every man between sixteen 
and sixty! That’s what they should do, don’t you think so, Mummy?” <br><br> He ran into 
the study and came back with a large map, which he spread out on the table, frantically measuring the distances. “We’re finished, I’m telling you, finished, unless ... “ <br><br> Hope was restored. “<i>I</i> see what they’re going to do,” he finally announced, with a big happy smile that revealed his white teeth. 
“I can see it very well. We’ll let them advance, advance, and then we’ll be waiting for them there and there, 
look, see, Mummy! Or even...” <br><br><b>[p.10]</b> <br><br> “Yes, yes,” said his mother. “Go and wash your hands now, and push back that bit 
of hair that keeps falling into your eyes. Just look at you.” <br><br> Fury in his heart, 
Hubert folded up his map. Only Philippe took him seriously, only Philippe spoke to him as an equal. “How I hate this 
family,” he said to himself and kicked violently at his little brother’s toys as he left the drawing room. Bernard began to 
cry. “That’ll teach him about life,” Hubert thought. <br><br> The nanny hurried to take Bernard and Jacqueline 
out of the room; the baby, Emmanuel, was already asleep over her shoulder. Holding Bernard’s hand, she strode through the 
door, crying for her three sons whom she imagined already dead, all of them. “Misery and misfortune, misery and misfortune!” she said quietly, over and over again, shaking her grey head. She continued muttering as she started running the bath and 
warmed the children’s pyjamas: “Misery and misfortune.” To her, those words embodied not only the political situation but, more particularly, her own life: working on the farm in her youth, her widowhood, her unpleasant daughters-in-law, living 
in other people’s houses since she was sixteen. <br><br> Auguste, the valet, shuffled back into the kitchen. 
On his solemn face was an expression of great contempt that was aimed at many things. <br><br> The energetic Madame 
Péricand went to her rooms and used the available fifteen minutes between the children’s bath time and dinner to listen to Jacqueline and Bernard recite 
their school lessons. Bright little voices rose up: “The earth is a sphere which sits on absolutely nothing.” <br><br> Only the elder Monsieur Péricand and Albert the cat remained in the drawing room. It had been a lovely day. The 
evening light softly illuminated the thick chestnut trees; Albert, a small grey tomcat who belonged to the children, seemed ecstatic. He 
rolled around on his back on the carpet. He jumped up on to the mantelpiece, nibbled at the edge of a peony in 
a large midnight-blue vase, delicately pawed at a snapdragon etched into the bronze corner-mount of a console table, then 
in one leap perched on the old man’s wheelchair and miaowed in his ear. The elder Monsieur Péricand stretched a hand towards him; 
<b> [p.11] </b> his hand was always freezing cold, purple and shaking. The cat was 
afraid and ran off. Dinner was about to be served. Auguste appeared and pushed the invalid into the dining room. <br><br> They were just sitting down at the table when the mistress of the house stopped suddenly, Jacqueline’s spoon of tonic suspended 
in mid-air. “It’s your father, children,” she said as the key turned in the lock. <br><br> It was indeed Monsieur Péricand, a short, stocky man with a gentle and slightly awkward manner. His normally well-
fed, relaxed and rosy-cheeked face looked, not frightened or worried, but extraordinarily shocked. He wore the expression found on 
people who have died in an accident, in a matter of seconds, without having had time to be afraid or suffer. They 
would be reading a book or looking out of a car window, thinking about things, or making their way along a train to 
the restaurant car when, all of a sudden, there they were in hell. <br><br> Madame Péricand rose quietly 
from her chair. “Adrien?” she called out, her voice anguished. <br><br> “It’s nothing. Nothing,” he muttered hastily, glancing furtively at the children, his father and the servants. <br><br> Madame Péricand understood. She nodded at the servants to continue serving dinner. She forced herself to swallow her food, but each mouthful seemed as hard 
and bland as a stone and stuck in her throat. Nevertheless, she repeated the phrases that had become ritual at mealtimes for the 
past thirty years. “Don’t drink before starting your soup,” she told the children. “Darling, your knife ... “ <br><br> She cut the elderly Monsieur Péricand’s filet of sole into small strips. He was on a complicated diet that allowed him 
to eat only the lightest food and Madame Péricand always served him herself, pouring his water, buttering his bread, tying his napkin 
round his neck, for he always started drooling when he saw food he liked. “I don’t think poor elderly invalids can bear to 
be touched by servants,” she would say to her friends. <br><br> “We must show grandfather how much we 
love him, my darlings,” she instructed the children, looking at the old man with terrifying tenderness. <br><br> <b> [p.12] </b> <br><br> In his later years, Monsieur Péricand had 
endowed various philanthropic projects, one of which was especially dear to his heart: the Penitent Children of the 16th Arrondissement, a venerable 
institution whose goal was to instil morals in delinquent minors. It had always been understood that the elder Monsieur Péricand would leave a certain 
sum of money to this organisation, but he had a rather irritating way of never revealing exactly how much. If he hadn’t enjoyed 
his meal, or if the children made too much noise, he would suddenly emerge from his stupor and say in a weak but 
clear voice, “I’m going to leave them five million.” <br><br> A painful silence would follow. <br><br> On the other hand, if he’d had a lovely meal and a good sleep in his chair by the window, 
in the sunshine, he would look up at his daughter-in-law with the pale, distant eyes of a small child, or a newborn puppy. <br><br> Charlotte was very tactful. She never replied, as others might, “You’re 
absolutely right, Father.” Instead, she would say sweetly, “Good Lord, you have plenty of time to think about that!” <br><br> The Péricand fortune was considerable, but it would be unjust to accuse them of coveting the elder 
Monsieur Péricand’s inheritance. They didn’t care about money, not at all, but money cared about them, so to speak! There 
were certain things that they deserved, including the Maltête-Lyonnais millions; they would never manage to spend it all but they would 
save it for their children’s children. As for the Penitent Children of the 16th Arrondissement, they were so involved with this charity that, twice a year, Madame Péricand organised classical music concerts for the unfortunate children; she would play the harp and was gratified to 
notice that, at certain passages, sobbing could be heard in the darkened concert hall. <br><br> Monsieur Péricand followed 
his daughter-in-law’s hands attentively. She was so distracted and upset that she forgot his sauce. His white beard waved 
about alarmingly. Madame Péricand came back to reality and quickly poured the parsley butter over the ivory flesh of the fish, but it 
was only after she placed a slice of lemon at the side of his plate that the old man was calm again. <br><br> Hubert leaned towards his brother and muttered, “It’s not going well, is it?” <br><br> 
<b> [p.13] </b> <br><br> “No,” he replied with a gesture and 
a look. Hubert dropped his trembling hands on to his lap. He was lost in thought, vividly imagining scenes of battle and 
victory. He was a Boy Scout. He and his friends would form a group of volunteers, sharpshooters who would defend their country 
to the end. In a flash, his mind raced through time and space. He and his friends: a small group bound 
by honour and loyalty. They would fight, they would fight all night long; they would save their bombed-out, burning 
Paris. What an exciting, wonderful life! His heart leapt. And yet, war was such a savage and horrifying thing. 
He was intoxicated by his imaginings. He clutched his knife so tightly in his hand that the piece of roast beef he was cutting 
fell on to the floor. <br><br> “Clumsy oaf,” whispered Bernard. He and Jacqueline were eight and nine 
years old, respectively, and were both thin, blond and stuck-up. The two of them were sent to bed after 
dessert and the elder Monsieur Péricand fell asleep at his usual place by the open window. The tender June day persisted, refusing to 
die. Each pulse of light was fainter and more exquisite than the last, as if bidding farewell to the earth, full of 
love and regret. The cat sat on the window ledge and looked nostalgically towards an horizon that was the colour of green crystal. 
<br><br> Monsieur Péricand paced up and down the room. “In a few days, maybe even tomorrow, the Germans 
will be on our doorstep. I’ve heard the High Command has decided to fight outside Paris, in Paris, beyond Paris. No 
one knows it yet, thank goodness, because after tomorrow there will be a stampede on the roads and at the train stations. 
You must leave for your mother’s house in Burgundy as early as possible tomorrow morning, Charlotte. As for me,” Monsieur Péricand 
said rather proudly, “I will share the fate of the treasures entrusted to my care.” <br><br> “I thought 
everything in the museum had been moved out in September,” said Hubert. <br><br> “Yes, but the temporary 
hiding place they chose in Brittany isn’t suitable; it turns out it’s as damp as a cellar. I just don’t understand it. 
A Committee was organised to safeguard national treasures. It had three sections and seven subsections, each of which was supposed to appoint a 
panel of experts responsible for hiding works of art during <b>[p.14]</b> the war, yet just last 
month an attendant in the provisional museum points out that suspicious stains are appearing on the canvases. Yes, a wonderful portrait of Mignard 
with his hands rotting away from a kind of green leprosy. They quickly sent the valuable packing cases back to Paris and now I’m 
waiting for an order to rush them off to somewhere even further away.” <br><br> “But what about us? 
How will we travel? By ourselves?” <br><br> “You’ll leave tomorrow morning, calmly, with the children and 
the two cars, and any furniture and luggage you can carry, of course. We can’t pretend that, by the end of 
the week, Paris might not be destroyed, burned down and thoroughly pillaged.” <br><br> “You are amazing!” exclaimed Charlotte. “You talk about it so calmly!” <br><br> Monsieur Péricand turned towards his wife, his 
face gradually returning to its normal pinkish colour-a matte pink, the colour of pigs who have been recently slaughtered. “That’s because 
I can’t really believe it,” he explained quietly. “Here I am, speaking to you, listening to you; we’ve decided 
to flee, to leave our home, yet I cannot believe that it is all real. Do you understand? Now go and 
get everything ready, Charlotte. Everything must be ready by tomorrow morning; you could be at your mother’s in time for dinner. 
I’ll join you as soon as I can.” <br><br> Madame Péricand’s face wore the same resigned, bitter look 
as when the children were ill and she was forced to put on an apron and nurse them; they all usually managed to be 
ill at the same time, though with different maladies. When this happened, Madame Péricand would come out of the children’s rooms with 
a thermometer in her hand, as if she were brandishing the crown of martyrdom, and everything in her bearing seemed to cry out: “You will reward your servants on Judgement Day, kind Jesus!” <br><br> “What about Philippe?” was 
all she asked. <br><br> “Philippe cannot leave Paris.” <br><br> Madame Péricand left the room, head held high. She refused to bow beneath the burden. She would see to it that the entire household was ready to 
leave in the morning: the elderly invalid, four children, the servants, the cat, plus the silver, the most valuable 
pieces of </b>[p.15]</b> china, the fur coats, food and medicine in case of emergencies. 
She shuddered. <br><br> In the sitting room, Hubert was pleading with his father. “Please let me stay. 
I can stay here with Philippe. And ... don’t make fun of me! Can’t you see that if I went and got my 
friends we could form a company of volunteers; we’re young, strong, ready for anything ... We could ... “ <br><br> Monsieur Péricand looked at him. “My poor boy!” was all he said. <br><br> “It’s all 
over? We’ve lost the war?” stammered Hubert. “Is ... is it true?” <br><br> And suddenly, to his horror, he felt himself burst into tears. He cried like a baby, like Bernard would have cried, his 
large mouth twisted, tears streaming down his face. Night was falling, soft and peaceful. A swallow flew by, lightly brushing 
against the balcony in the dark night air. The cat let out a frustrated little cry of desire. <br><br> 
<b>[p.16]</b> <br><br><h2>3</h2><br><br>The writer Gabriel Corte was 
working on his terrace, between the dark, swaying woods and the golden green setting sun fading over the Seine. How peaceful everything 
was around him! Beside him were his well-trained faithful friends, great white dogs who were awake yet motionless, their noses 
pressed against the cool paving stones, their eyes half closed. At his feet his mistress silently picked up the sheets of paper he 
dropped. His servants, the secretary, were all invisible behind the shimmering windows; they were hidden somewhere in the background of the 
house, in the wings of his life, a life he desired to be as brilliant, luxurious and disciplined as a ballet. 
He was fifty years old and had his favourite games. Depending on the day, he was either Lord of the Heavens or a 
miserable writer crushed by hard work and labouring in vain. On his desk he had had engraved, “To lift such a heavy weight, Sisyphus, you will need all your courage.” His fellow writers were jealous of him because he was rich. He himself 
bitterly told the story of his first candidature to the Académie Française: one of the electors implored to vote for him had sarcastically replied, “He has three telephone lines!” <br><br> He was handsome, with the cruel, languid movements of a 
cat, expressive soft hands and a slightly full Roman face. Only Florence, his official mistress, was allowed to remain in his 
bed until morning (the others never spent the night with him). Only she knew how many masks he could put on, this 
old flirt with dark circles under his eyes and thin arched eyebrows, too thin, like a woman’s. <br><br> 
That evening he was working as he normally did, half-naked. His house in Saint-Cloud had been specially built to 
be hidden away from prying eyes, right down to the vast, wonderful terrace, planted with blue cinerarias. Blue was Gabriel Corte’s 
favourite colour. He could <b>[p.17]</b>only write if he had a small glass bowl of deep 
lapis lazuli beside him. He would look at it now and again, and caress it like a mistress. What he liked best 
in Florence, as he often told her, were her clear blue eyes, which gave him the same feeling of coolness as his 
glass bowl. “Your eyes quench my thirst,” he would murmur. She had a soft, slightly flabby chin, a contralto 
voice that was still beautiful and, Gabriel Corte confided to his friends, something cow-like in her expression. I like that. A woman should look like a heifer: sweet, trusting and generous, with a body as white as cream. You know, like those old actresses whose skin has been softened by massage, makeup and powder. <br><br> He stretched his 
delicate fingers in the air and clicked them like castanets. Florence handed him a lemon, then an orange and some glace strawberries; 
he consumed an enormous amount of fruit. She gazed at him, almost kneeling before him on a suede pouffe, in that attitude 
of adoration that pleased him so much (though he couldn’t have imagined any other). He was tired, but it was that good 
tiredness which comes from doing enjoyable work. Sometimes he said it was better than the tiredness that comes after making love. <br><br> He looked benevolently at his mistress. “Well, that’s not gone too badly, I think. And you know, 
the midpoint.” (He drew a triangle in the air indicating its top.) “I’ve got past it.” <br><br> She knew what he meant. Inspiration flagged in the middle of a novel. At those moments, Corte struggled like a 
horse trying in vain to pull a carriage out of the mud. She brought her hands together in a gracious gesture of admiration and 
surprise. “Already! I congratulate you, my dear. Now it will go smoothly, I’m sure.” <br><br> “God willing!” he murmured. “But Lucienne worries me.” <br><br> “Lucienne?” <br><br> He looked at her scornfully, his eyes hard and cold. When he was in a good mood, Florence would say, “You still have that killer look in your eye ... “ and he would laugh, flattered. But he hated being teased when 
in the throes of creativity. <br><br> She couldn’t even remember who Lucienne was. <br><br> “Of 
course,” she lied. “I don’t know what I was thinking!” <br><br> “I don’t know either,” he said in a wounded voice. <br><br> <b>[p.18]</b> <br><br> But she seemed so sad and humble that he took pity on her and softened. “I keep telling you, you don’t 
pay enough attention to the minor characters. A novel should be like a street full of strangers, where no more than two or 
three people are known to us in depth. Look at writers like Proust. They knew how to use minor characters to humiliate, 
to belittle their protagonists. In a novel, there is nothing more valuable than teaching the lesson of humility to the heroes. Remember, in War and Peace, the little peasant girls who cross the road, laughing, in front of Prince Andrei’s carriage? He 
speaks to them, directly, and the reader’s imagination is at once lifted; now there is not just one face, not just 
one soul. He portrays the many faces of the crowd. Wait, I’ll read you that passage, it’s remarkable. Put the 
light on,” he said, for night had fallen. <br><br> “Planes,” Florence replied, looking up 
at the sky. <br><br> “Won’t they leave me the hell alone?” he thundered. <br><br> He hated the war; it threatened much more than his lifestyle or peace of mind. It continually destroyed the world of the 
imagination, the only world where he felt happy. It was like a shrill, brutal trumpet shattering the fragile crystal walls he’d 
taken such pains to build in order to shut out the rest of the world. <br><br> “God!” he 
sighed. “How upsetting, what a nightmare!” <br><br> Brought back down to earth, he asked to see 
the newspapers. She gave them to him without a word. They came in from the terrace and he leafed through the papers, 
a dark look on his face. “All in all,” he said, “nothing new.” <br><br> He 
didn’t want to see anything new. He dismissed reality with the bored, startled gesture of a sleeping man awakened abruptly in the middle 
of a dream. He even shaded his eyes with his hand as if to block out a dazzling light. <br><br> Florence walked towards the radio. He stopped her. “No, no, leave it alone.” <br><br> 
“But Gabriel ... “ <br><br> He went white with anger. “Listen to me! I don’t want to hear anything. Tomorrow, tomorrow will he soon enough. If I hear any had news now (and it can only he bad with these 
c**** in government) my momentum will he lost, my inspiration blocked. Look, you’d better <b>[p.19]</b> call Mademoiselle Sudre. I think I’ll dictate a few pages!” She hurried to summon the secretary. <br><br> As she was coming hack to the drawing room, the telephone rang. “It’s Monsieur Jules Blanc phoning from the Presidential 
Office, wishing to speak to Monsieur Corte,” said the valet. <br><br> She carefully closed all the doors 
so that no noise could filter through to where Gabriel and his secretary were working. Meanwhile, the valet went to prepare a cold 
supper for his master, as he always did. Gabriel ate little during the day but was often hungry at night. There was 
some leftover cold partridge, a few peaches, some delicious little cheeses (which Florence herself had ordered from a shop on the Left 
Bank) and a bottle of Pommery. After many years of reflection and research, Corte had come to the conclusion that, given 
his poor digestion, only champagne would do. Florence listened to Jules Blanc’s voice on the telephone, an exhausted, almost imperceptible voice, and at the same time heard all the familiar sounds of the house-the soft clinking of china and glass, Gabriel’s deep, languid voice-and she felt as though she were living a confusing dream. She put down the phone and called the valet. He had been in their service for a long time and trained for what he called “the workings of the house,” an 
inadvertent pastiche of seventeenth-century parlance that Gabriel found quite charming. <br><br> “What can we do, Marcel? 
Jules Blanc himself is telling us to leave ... “ <br><br> “Leave? To go where, Madame?” <br><br> “Anywhere. To Brittany. The Midi. It seems the Germans have crossed the Seine. What can we do?” she repeated. <br><br> “I have no idea, Madame,” said Marcel frostily. <br><br> They’d waited long enough to ask his opinion. They should have left last night, he thought. Isn’t it just pathetic 
to see rich, famous people who have no more common sense than animals! And even animals can sense danger ... As for him, well, he wasn’t afraid of the Germans. He’d seen them in ‘14. He’d he left alone; he was too old 
to he called up. But he was outraged: the house, the furniture, the silver-they hadn’t thought about anything in 
time. He let out a barely audible sigh. He would have had everything wrapped up long <b>[p.20]</b> ago, hidden away in packing cases, in a safe place. He felt a sort of affectionate scorn towards his employers, the same scorn he felt towards the white greyhounds: they were beautiful but stupid. <br><br> “Madame should warn 
Monsieur,” he concluded. <br><br> Florence started walking towards the drawing room, but she had barely opened the 
door when she heard Gabriel’s voice. It was the voice he assumed on his worst days, when he was most agitated: slow, hoarse, interrupted now and again by a nervous cough. <br><br> She gave orders to Marcel and the maid, then thought about their most valuable possessions, the ones to be taken when there’s danger, when you have to escape. She 
placed a light but sturdy suitcase on her bed. First she hid the jewellery she’d had the foresight to get out of the safe. Over it she put some underwear, her washing things, two spare blouses, a little evening dress, so she’d have something 
to wear once they’d arrived-she knew there’d be delays on the road-a dressing gown and slippers, her make-up 
case (which took up a lot of space) and of course Gabriel’s manuscripts. She tried in vain to close the suitcase. 
She moved the jewellery box, tried again. No, something definitely had to go. But what? Everything was essential. She 
pressed her knee against the case, pushed down, tried to lock it and failed. She was getting annoyed. <br><br> Finally, she called her maid. “Do you think you can manage to close it, Julie?” <br><
br> “It’s too full, Madame. It’s impossible.” <br><br> For a second Florence hesitated between her make
-up case and the manuscripts, chose the make-up and closed the suitcase. <br><br> The manuscripts could 
be stuffed into the hatbox, she thought. I know him, though! His outbursts, his crises, his heart medicine. 
We’ll see tomorrow, it’s better to get everything ready tonight and not tell him anything. Then we’ll see ... <br><br> <b>[p.21]</b> <br><br><h2>4</h2><br><br> Along with their fortune, the Maltête family of Lyon had bequeathed to the Péricands a predisposition to tuberculosis. This illness had claimed two of Adrien Péricand’s sisters 
at an early age; his son, Philippe, had suffered from it a few years earlier. Two years in the mountains, 
however, seemed to have cured Father Philippe, his re·· covery coinciding with the moment when he was finally ordained a priest. His 
lungs were still weak, so when war was declared he was exempt. Nevertheless, he looked strong. He had good colour in 
his cheeks, thick black eyebrows and a healthy, rugged appearance. His parish was a little village in the Auvergne. As soon 
as his vocation had become apparent, Madame Péricand had given him up to the Lord. In exchange for this sacrifice, she had 
hoped for a bit of worldly glory and that he might be destined for great things; instead, he was teaching the catechism to 
the small farmers of Puy-de-Dome. If the Church was unable to find some greater responsibility for him, even a 
monastery would be better than this poor parish. “It’s such a waste,” she would say to him vehemently. “You are wasting 
the gifts the Good Lord has given you.” But she consoled herself with the thought that the cold climate was good for him. He seemed to need the kind of air he’d breathed in the high altitudes of Switzerland for two years. Back on the streets 
of Paris, he strode along in a manner that made passers-by smile, for it seemed out of keeping with his cassock. <br><br> And so that morning he stopped in front of a grey building and entered a courtyard that smelled of 
cabbage. The Penitent Children of the 16th Arrondissement were lodged in a small private residence set behind a tall administrative building. As Madame 
Péricand explained in her annual letter to the Friends of the charitable institution <b>[p.22]</b> (Founding Member, 500 francs per year; Benefactor, 100 francs; Member, 20 francs), the children lived in the best possible material and 
moral conditions, were apprenticed to a variety of trades and participated in healthy physical activities: a small glass lean-to had been 
built on to the house, providing a carpenter’s workshop and a cobbler’s bench. Through the window-panes, Father Péricand saw the 
round heads of the little inmates look up for a second when they heard his footsteps. In one part of the garden, between 
the steps and the lean-to, two boys aged fifteen and sixteen were working with a supervisor. There were no uniforms. 
The Institution hadn’t wanted to recall the prisons already known to some of them. They wore clothing made by charitable people using leftover wool. One of the boys had on an apple-green cardigan that revealed his long, thin, hairy wrists. In perfect discipline 
and silence, he and his companion were digging the earth, pulling out grass, reporting flowers. They nodded to Father Péricand, 
who smiled at them. The priest’s face was calm, his expression stern and a bit sad. But his smile was very sweet, slightly shy, with a kind of gentle reproach: “I love you,” it seemed to say. “Why don’t you love 
me?” The children were watching him, saying nothing. <br><br> “What beautiful weather,” he murmured. 
<br><br> “Yes, Father,” they replied, their voices cold and forced. <br><br> Philippe 
said a few more words to them, then went into the house. Inside it was grey and clean, and the room where 
he found himself was almost bare, containing only two cane chairs. It was the reception room, where the charges could have visitors, a practice tolerated but not encouraged. In any case, almost all of them were orphans. From time to time some neighbour 
who had known their dead parents, some older sister living in the country, would remember them and come to visit. But Father 
Péricand had never met a living soul in this room. The director’s office was on the same floor. <br><br> 
The director was a short, fair man with pink eyelids and a pointed nose that trembled like an animal’s snout when he smelled food. His charges called him “the rat” or “the tapir.” He stretched both arms out to Philippe; his hands were cold and 
clammy. “I simply do not <b>[p.23]</b> know how to thank you for your kindness, Father! You are really going to take charge of our boys?” <br><br> The children had to be evacuated the 
following day. He’d just been called urgently to the Midi, to his sick wife’s side ... <br><br> “The supervisor 
is afraid he’ll be snowed under, that he won’t be able to manage our thirty boys all alone.” <br><br> “They seem very obedient,” Philippe remarked. <br><br> “Oh, they’re good boys. We get them into 
shape, teach the rebellious ones how to behave. But without wishing to seem proud, I’m the one who keeps everything going here. The supervisors are afraid. In any case, the war has claimed one of them and as for the other ... “ He 
pouted. “Excellent if he follows a rigid routine, but incapable of taking any initiative whatsoever, one of those people who could drown 
in a glass of water. Anyway, I was wondering which Saint to pray to in order to evacuate these boys when your good 
father told me you were passing through, leaving tomorrow for the mountains and that you wouldn’t refuse to help us.” <br><br> “I’ll gladly do it. How are you planning to get the children out?” <br><br> “We’ve 
been able to get hold of two trucks. We’ve got enough petrol. They’re going somewhere that is only about fifty kilometres from your 
parish, you know. It won’t take you too far out of your way.” <br><br> “I’m free until 
Thursday,” said Philippe. “One of my Brothers is replacing me.” <br><br> “Oh, the journey won’t 
take that long! Your father tells me you are familiar with the house one of our benefactresses has placed at our disposal. It’s 
a large estate in the middle of the woods. The proprietor inherited it last year and the furniture, which was. very beautiful, was sold just before the war. The children can camp in the grounds. They will enjoy doing that in this lovely weather. At the beginning of the war they spent three months camping in another chateau in Corrèze kindly offered to us by one of these 
good ladies. We didn’t have any heating at all there. Every morning we had to break the ice on the jugs. The 
children have never behaved so well. The days of peacetime luxury and ease,” said the director, “are over.” <br><br> The 
priest looked at the clock. <br><br> <b>[p.24]</b> 
<br><br> “Would you do me the honour of having lunch with me, Father?” <br><br> 
Philippe declined. He’d arrived in Paris that morning having travelled through the night. He was worried that Hubert might do something hot-
headed and had come to get him, but the family was leaving that very day for Nièvre. Philippe wanted to be there when 
they left: an extra pair of hands wouldn’t go amiss, he thought, smiling. <br><br> “I’ll go and 
tell the boys you’ll be taking my place,” said the director. “Perhaps you’d like to say a few words to them to 
get acquainted. I had intended to speak to them myself, to tell them the whole country’s at war, but I’m leaving at 
four o’clock and ... “ <br><br> “I’ll speak to them,” said Father Péricand. <br><br> 
He lowered his eyes, joined his hands and placed his fingertips on his lips. His face took on an expression of harshness and 
sadness as he looked into his heart. He disliked these unfortunate children. He walked towards them with all the kindness and goodwill he 
was capable of, but all he felt in their presence was coldness and disgust, not a single glimmer of love, nothing of 
that divine feeling which even the most miserable of sinners awoke in him when begging for forgiveness. There was more humility in bragging atheists, in hardened blasphemers, than in the eyes and words of these children. Their superficial obedience was terrifying. Despite being baptised, 
despite the holy sacraments of Communion and penance, no divine light illuminated them. They were children of Satan, without even enough spirituality 
to elevate themselves to a point where they desired divine light; they didn’t feel it; they didn’t want it; they didn’t miss 
it. Father Péricand thought tenderly of the good little children to whom he taught the catechism. He had no illusions about them, 
of course. He knew very well that evil had already planted solid roots in their young souls, but at certain moments they showed 
such promise of kindness, of innocent grace, that they trembled with pity and horror when he spoke to them of the Passion of 
Christ. He was eager to get back to them. He thought of the First Communion they would celebrate the following Sunday. 
<br><br> Meanwhile, he followed the director into the hall where the boys had been assembled. The shutters were closed. 
In the darkness, he <b>[p.25]</b> tripped on one of the steps near the doorway and had 
to grab on to the director’s arm to avoid falling. He looked at the children, waiting, hoping for some stifled laughter. 
Sometimes a ridiculous incident like this breaks the ice between students and teachers. But no. Not one of them reacted. They stood 
in a semicircle against the wall with the youngest-those between eleven and fourteen-in front; their faces were pale, their 
lips tightly clenched, their eyes lowered. Almost all of them were small for their age and scrawny. The older ones, aged 
fifteen to eighteen, stood at the back. Some of them had the low brow, the thick hands of killers. As soon 
as he was in their presence, Father Péricand again felt a’ strange sensation of aversion, almost fear. He must overcome it at 
all costs. He walked towards them and they stepped back imperceptibly, as if they wanted to sink into the wall. 
<br><br> “My sons, from tomorrow until the end of our journey, I shall be looking after you instead of the director,” he said. “You know that you are leaving Paris. Only God knows the fate in store for our soldiers, our 
dear country; He alone, in His infinite wisdom, knows the destiny of each of us in the days ahead. It is, alas, immensely likely that we shall all suffer dearly, for public misfortunes consist of a multitude of private misfortunes and this is 
the only time when, poor blind ungrateful creatures that we are, we feel the solidarity which unites us, forms us into a 
single being. What I would like to have from each of you is a gesture of faith in God. Our lips form the 
words ‘May His will be done,’ but deep in our hearts we cry out ‘May my will be done, oh Lord.’ Yet why do we seek God? Because we hope for happiness: it is man’s nature to desire happiness and if we accept 
His will, God can give us this happiness, right now, without making us wait for death and Resurrection. My sons, 
may each of you entrust yourself to God. May each of you seek Him as your father, place your life in His loving 
hands, so divine peace can fill your hearts.” <br><br> He paused for a moment, looked at them. “Let us say a little prayer together.” <br><br> Thirty shrill voices indifferently recited “Our Father”; thirty thin 
faces surrounded the priest. As he made the sign of the Cross over <b>[p.26]</b> them they 
lowered their heads sharply, mechanically. Only one lad turned his eyes towards the window. He had a large bitter mouth and the 
ray of sun that slipped through the closed shutters lit up his delicate freckled cheek, his thin pinched nose. 
<br><br> Not one of them moved or spoke. When the supervisor blew his whistle, they lined up and left the hall. 
<br><br> <b> [p.27] </b> 

<br><br><h2>5</h2><br><br> The streets were empty. People were closing their shops. The metallic shudder of falling iron shutters was the only sound to break 
the silence, a sound familiar to anyone who has woken in a city threatened by riot or war. As they walked to work, the Michauds saw loaded trucks waiting in front of the government buildings. They shook their heads. As always, they linked arms 
to cross the Avenue de l’Opéra to the office, even though the road, that morning, was deserted. They were both employees 
of the same bank and worked in the same branch, although the husband had been an accountant there for fifteen years while she had 
started only a few months earlier on a “temporary contract for the duration of the war.” She taught singing, but the previous 
September had lost all her students when their families took them to the country for fear of the bombings. Her husband’s salary had never 
been enough to pay their bills and their only son had been called up. Thanks to this secretarial job, they just about managed. As she always said, “We mustn’t ask for the impossible, my dear.” They had been familiar with hardship ever since 
they left their families to get married against their parents’ will. That was a long time ago. Traces of beauty still remained on 
her thin face. Her hair was grey. He was a short man, with a weary, neglected appearance, but sometimes, 
when he turned towards her, looked at her, smiled at her, a loving teasing flame lit up his eyes-the same, he thought, yes, truly, almost the same as before. He helped her across the road and picked up the glove 
she’d dropped. She thanked him by gently pressing her fingers over his as he handed it to her. Other employees were hurrying towards 
the open door of the bank. One of them came up to the Michauds and asked, “Well, are we finally leaving?” <br><br> The Michauds had no idea. It was 10 June, a Monday. When they <b>[p.28]</b> had 
left the office on Friday, everything had seemed under control. The executives were being sent to 
the countryside but nothing had been said about the employees. Their fate was being decided in the manager’s offices on the first floor, 
on the other side of two large green padded doors; the Michauds walked past them quickly and in silence. At the end of 
the corridor they separated. He went upstairs to Accounting, she remained on the managerial floor: she was secretary to one of the 
directors, Monsieur Corbin, the head of the branch. The second director, the Count de Furières (married to one of the 
Salomon-Worms), was responsible for the foreign affairs of the bank, whose clientele was most select, and limited, preferably, 
to wealthy landowners and the most important names in the metalworking industry. Monsieur Corbin hoped that his colleague, the Count de Furières, 
would make it easier for him to get into the Jockey Club. For several years now he had lived in hope. However, 
the Count deemed that favours such as invitations to dinner parties and to join the de Furières hunting party were ample compensation for the generous 
credit facilities allowed to him. In the evening, Madame Michaud would amuse her husband with impersonations of the meetings between the two directors, their sour smiles, Corbin’s grimaces, the look on the Count’s face. It relieved a bit of the monotony of their working 
day. But for some time now even this distraction had failed them: Monsieur de Furières had been sent to the Alpine front and 
Corbin was running the branch alone. <br><br> Madame Michaud collected the post and went into the small room next to 
the manager’s office. A faint perfume lingered in the air, a sign that Corbin was busy. He was patron to a dancer: Mademoiselle Arlette Corail. All his mistresses were dancers. He seemed not to be interested in women of any other profession. Not 
one secretary, no matter how pretty or young, had ever managed to lure him away from this particular penchant. Whether beautiful or 
ugly, young or old, he treated all his female employees in the same aggressive, rude and mean-spirited manner. His 
odd little voice emerged from a head !hat sat on top of a fat, heavy, well-fed body; when he 
got angry his voice became as high-pitched and feverish as a woman’s. <br><br> The shrill sound Madame Michaud 
knew so well was filtering <b>[p.29]</b> through the closed doors today. One of the employees came 
in and said quietly, “We’re leaving.” <br><br> “When?” <br><br> “Tomorrow.” 
<br><br> In the corridor, whispering shadows passed by. People were gathering near the windows and outside their offices. 
Corbin finally opened his door and saw the dancer out. She was wearing a candy-pink cotton suit and a large straw hat 
covered her dyed hair. She was slender, with a good figure, but beneath the make-up, her face was hard 
and tired. Red patches had appeared on her cheeks and forehead. She was obviously furious. <br><br> “Do you 
want me to leave on foot?” Madame Michaud heard her say. <br><br> “Will you never listen to me? Go back to the garage at once. Offer them money, promise them whatever they want and the car will be fixed.” <br><br> “But I’m telling you it’s impossible! Impossible! Don’t you understand?” <br><br> 
“Look, my dear, what do you want me to say? The Germans are at the gates of Paris and you’re talking about 
taking the road to Versailles. Why on earth would you want to do that? Take the train.” <br><br
> “Do you have any idea what’s going on at the train stations?” <br><br> “It won’t be any better 
on the roads.” <br><br> “You have ... you have no conscience at all. You’re leaving, you have 
two cars ...” <br><br> “I need to move the files and some of the staff. What the hell do 
you want me to do with the staff?” <br><br> “Oh, please! Must you be so rude? 
You have your wife’s car!” <br><br> “You want to go in my wife’s car? What a wonderful idea!” <br><br> The dancer turned her back on him and whistled for her dog, who bounded in. She 
put his collar on, her hands trembling with indignation. “My entire youth sacrificed to a ...” <br><br> “For 
goodness sake! Stop making a scene. I’ll phone you tonight, I’ll see what can be done ...” 
<br><br> “No, no. I see very well that all I can do now is go and die in a ditch at the side 
of the road ...” <br><br> <b>[p.30]</b> <br><br> “Oh, do shut up, you’re making me furious ...” <br><br> They finally realised that the secretary was listening to 
them. They lowered their voices and Corbin, taking his mistress by the arm, walked her to the door. 
<br><br> He came back and glanced at Madame Michaud who, finding herself in his path, was the first target of his fury. “Get the section heads together in the meeting room. Right now, if you don’t mind!” <br><br> 
Madame Michaud went out to pass on his orders. A few moments later the employees filed into a large room containing a marble bust 
of the bank’s founder and a full-length portrait of the current president, <br><br> Monsieur Auguste-Jean, 
who had been ailing for some time with a softening of the brain caused by his great age. <br><br> Monsieur 
Corbin received thetn standing behind· the oval table where nine sheets of blotting paper marked the Board of Directors’ places. “Gentlemen, we are 
leaving tomorrow morning at eight o’clock to go to our branch in Tours. I will take the Board’s files in my car. Madame 
Michaud, you and your husband will accompany me. As for those who have a car, be in front of the bank at 
six o’clock to pick up other staff members, that is, the ones I have selected. I will see what I can do 
for the others but, if necessary, they will have to take the train. Thank you, gentlemen.” 
<br><br> He disappeared and immediately the murmur of anxious voices buzzed around the room. Only two days before, Corbin had declared he 
could foresee no reason to leave, that the hysterical rumours were the work of traitors, that the bank, the bank, would 
remain where it was, would fulfil its obligations even if others did not. Given that the “withdrawal,” as it was discreetly 
called, had been decided so suddenly, all-without doubt-was lost! The women wiped the tears from their eyes. 
Through the crowd the Michauds found each other. Both of them were thinking about their son, Jean-Marie. His last letter 
was dated 2 June. Only a week ago. My God, anything could have happened since then! In their anguish, their 
only comfort was being together. <br><br> “How lucky we are not to have to be apart,” he whispered 
to her. <br><br> <b>[p.31]</b>

<br><br>6<br><br> 

Night was falling but the Péricands' car was still waiting outside their 
door. Tied to the roof was the soft deep mattress that had adorned their 
marital bed for twenty-eight years. Fixed to the boot were a pram and a 
bicycle. They were trying in vain to cram in all the family's bags, suitcases 
and overnight cases, as well as the baskets containing the sandwiches, the 
thermos flask, bottles of milk for the children, cold chicken, ham, bread 
and the boxes of baby cereal for the elder Monsieur Péricand. There was also 
the cat's basket. At first they had been delayed because their clean linen 
hadn't been delivered and the laundry couldn't be reached by telephone. Their 
large white embroidered sheets were part of the Péricand-Maltête inheritance, 
along with the jewellery, the silver and the library: it was impossible to 
leave them behind. The whole morning had been wasted looking for things. 
The launderer himself was leaving. He had ended up giving Madame Péricand her 
sheets in damp, crumpled bundles. She had gone without lunch in order to 
supervise personally the packing of the linen. It had been agreed that the 
servants, along with Hubert and Bernard, would get the train. But at all the 
train stations the gates were already closed and guarded by soldiers. The crowds were hanging
on to them, shaking them, then swarming chaotically back
down the neighbouring streets. Women in tears were running with
their children in their arms. The last taxis were stopped: they were offered
two thousand, three thousand francs to leave Paris. “Just to
Orleans...” But the drivers refused, they had no more petrol. The
Péricands had to go back home. They finally managed to get hold of
a van, which would take Madeleine, Maria, Auguste and Bernard,
with his little brother on his lap. As for Hubert, he would follow the
cars on his bicycle.<br><br>

All along the Boulevard Delessert, groups of people appeared
outside their houses-women, old people and children, gesticulating
to one another, trying, at first calmly and then with increasing agitation
and a mad, dizzy excitement, to get the family and all the baggage
into a Renault, a saloon, a sports car ... Not a single light shone
through the windows. The stars were coming out, springtime stars
with a silvery glow. Paris had its sweetest smell, the smell of chestnut
trees in bloom and of petrol with a few grains of dust that crack
under your teeth like pepper. In the darkness the danger seemed to
grow. You could smell the suffering in the air, in the silence. Even
people who were normally calm and controlled were overwhelmed
by anxiety and fear. Everyone looked at their house and thought,
“Tomorrow it will be in ruins, tomorrow I’ll have nothing left. We
Haven’t hurt anyone. Why?” Then a wave of indifference washed
over their souls: “What’s the difference! It’s only stone, wood—nothing
living! What matters is survival!” Who cared about the
tragedy of their country? Not these people, not the people who were
leaving that night. Panic obliterated everything that wasn’t animal
instinct, involuntary physical reaction. Grab the most valuable
things you own in the world and then ... ! And, on that night, only
people-the living and the breathing, the crying and the lovingwere
precious. Rare was the person who cared about their possessions;
everyone wrapped their arms tightly round their wife or child
and nothing else mattered; the rest could go up in flames.<br><br>

If you listened closely, you could hear the sound of planes in the
sky. French or enemy? No one knew. “Faster, faster,” said Monsieur
Péricand. But then they would realise they’d forgotten the box of
lace, or the ironing board. It was impossible to make the servants listen
to reason. They were trembling with fear. Even though they
wanted to leave too, their need to follow a routine was stronger than
their terror; and they insisted on doing everything exactly as they had
always done when getting ready to go to the countryside for the summer
holidays. The trunks had to be packed in the usual way, with
everything in its correct place. They hadn’t understood the reality of
the situation. They were living two different moments, you might
say, half in the present and half deep in the past, as if what was <b>[p.33]</b> 
happening could only seep into a small part of their consciousnesses, the
most superficial part, leaving all the deeper regions peacefully asleep.
Nanny, her grey hair undone, her lips clenched, her eyelids swollen
from crying, was folding Jacqueline’s freshly ironed handkerchiefs
with amazingly firm, precise movements. Madame Péricand, already
in the car, called her, but the old woman didn’t reply, didn’t even
hear her.<br><br>

Finally, Philippe had to go upstairs to look for her. “Come along,
Nanny, what’s the matter? We have to leave. What’s the matter?” he
repeated gently, taking her hand.<br><br>

“Oh, leave me be, my little one,” she groaned, forgetting suddenly
that she now only called him “Monsieur Philippe” or “Father,” and
instinctively returning to the past. “Go on, leave me be. You’re kind
but we’re lost!”<br><br>

“Come now, don’t get so upset, you poor thing, leave the handkerchiefs,
get dressed and come downstairs quickly. Mother is waiting
for you.”<br><br>

“I’ll never see my boys again, Philippe!”<br><br>

“But you will, you will,” he said, then he himself tidied up the old
woman’s hair and put a black straw hat on her head.<br><br>

“You’ll pray to the Holy Virgin for my boys, won’t you?”<br><br>

He kissed her gently on the cheek. “Yes, yes, I promise. Come·
along now.”<br><br>

The driver and the concierge passed them on the staircase as they
went up to collect the elder Monsieur Péricand. He had been kept
away from all the commotion until the very last minute. Auguste and
the male nurse were just finishing dressing him. The old man had had
an operation a short while ago. He was wearing a complicated bandage
and, given the cold night air, a flannel girdle so big and so wide
that his body was swaddled like a mummy. Auguste buttoned his old-fashioned
boots and pulled a light but warm jumper over his head. As
he put on his jacket, Monsieur Péricand, who until now had wordlessly
let himself be manipulated like an old, stiff doll, seemed to
wake up from a dream and mumbled, “Wool waistcoat...”<br><br>

“You will be too warm, Sir,” Auguste remarked, trying to pay no
attention.
<br><br><b>[p.34]</b><br><br>
But his master stared at him with his pale, glazed eyes and repeated
more loudly, “Wool waistcoat!”<br><br>

He was given it. They put on his long overcoat, the scarf that went
twice round his neck and fastened at the back with a safety pin. Then
they sat him in his wheelchair and took him down the five flights of
stairs. The wheelchair wouldn’t fit in the lift. The nurse, a strong,
red-headed man from Alsace, went down the stairs backwards and
took the brunt of the weight while Auguste respectfully supported
from behind. The two men stopped on each landing to wipe away the
sweat running down their faces, while Monsieur Péricand calmly
contemplated the ceiling and quietly nodded his beautiful beard. It
was impossible to imagine what he thought of this hasty departure.
However, contrary to what they might have believed, he was fully informed
about recent events. He had murmured while being dressed,
“A beautiful, clear night ... I wouldn’t be surprised if...”<br><br>

He seemed to have fallen asleep and only finished his sentence a
few seconds later, at the doorstep: “I wouldn’t be surprised if we
were bombed on the way!”<br><br>

“What an idea, Monsieur Péricand!” the nurse exclaimed with all
the optimism befitting his profession.<br><br>

But already the old man had resumed his look of profound indifference.
They finally got the wheelchair out of the house. The elder
Monsieur Péricand settled in the right-hand corner of the car, well
sheltered from any draughts. His daughter-in-law, hands trembling
with impatience, wrapped him up in the Scottish shawl whose long
fringes he liked to twist
.
“Is everything ready?” Philippe asked. “Good, get going.” If they
make it out of Paris before tomorrow morning, they’ll have a chance,
he thought.<br><br>

“My gloves,” said the old man.<br><br>

They gave him his gloves. It was difficult getting them to fit over
his wrists, made thicker by the layers of wool. The elder Monsieur
Péricand refused to leave a single button undone. Finally everything
was ready. Emmanuel was wailing in his nanny’s arms. Madame
Péricand kissed her husband and her son. She didn’t cry, but as she
held them tight they could feel her heart beating fast against their
chests. The driver started the car. Hubert got on his bicycle.<br><br>

<b>[p.35]</b><br><br>

The elder Monsieur Péricand lifted up his hand. “Just a minute,”
he said in a calm, quiet voice.<br><br>

“What is it, Father?”<br><br>

But he made a sign that he couldn’t tell his daughter-in-law.
“Did you forget something?”<br><br>

He nodded his head. The car stopped. Madame Péricand, white
with frustration, leaned out of the window. “I think Papa has forgotten
something?” she shouted in the direction of the small group left
on the pavement, made up of her husband, Philippe and the nurse.<br><br>

When the car had reversed back and stopped in front of the house,
the old man, with a small discreet gesture, called over the nurse and
whispered something in his ear.<br><br>

“What is going on? This is madness! We’ll still be here tomorrow,”
exclaimed Madame Péricand. “What do you need, Father?
What does he want?” she asked.<br><br>

The nurse lowered his eyes. “Monsieur wants us to take him back
upstairs ... to do pee-pee...”<br><br>

<h2>7</h2><br><br>

Charles Langelet was kneeling on the parquet floor of his empty
drawing room, wrapping up his porcelain himself. He was fat and
had a heart condition; the sigh he let out from his heavy chest
sounded like a groan. He was alone in the apartment. The servants,
who had been with him for seven years, had panicked when, with the
rest of Paris, they had woken to a thick man-made fog raining down
on them like a shower of ashes. They had left early to get provisions,
but had never come back. Monsieur Langelet thought bitterly of the
generous wages and all the presents he had given them since they had
come into his service, money which had allowed them to buy, no
doubt, some peaceful cottage, some secluded little farm in their native
towns.<br><br>

Monsieur Langelet should have left long ago. He admitted that
now, but he had been unable to deviate from his normal routine.
Frosty, scornful, the only things he loved in this world were his apartment
and the objects scattered around him on the floor: the rugs had
been rolled up with mothballs and hidden in the cellar. All the
windows were decorated with long strips of pink and baby-blue adhesive
tape. Monsieur: Langelet himself, with his pale, fat hands, had
arranged them in the shape of stars, ships and unicorns. They were
the envy of his friends, but how could he possibly have lived with a
drab, common decor? All around him, in his house, everything consisted
of fragments of beauty. Sometimes modest, sometimes valuable,
these fragments combined to form a unique atmosphere of soft
luminosity-the only one worthy of a cultured man, he thought.
When he was twenty he had worn a ring with an inscription inside:
<i>This thing of Beauty is a guilt for ever</i> (Monsieur Langelet happily
spoke English to himself: the language, with its poetry, its force, <b>[p.37]</b>
suited certain of his moods). It was childish and he had got rid of this
trinket, but the maxim remained with him and he remained faithful
to it.<br><br>

He pushed himself up on to one knee and looked around with a
piercing, hopeless expression that took in many things: the Seine beneath
his windows, the graceful curve of the wall between his two recf;
ption rooms, the fireplace with its antique andirons and the high
ceilings where light floated, a clear light coloured green and as transparent
as water because it was filtered through almond-coloured
canvas blinds on the balcony.<br><br>

Now and again the telephone would ring. There were still indecisive
people in, Paris, idiots who were afraid to leave, hoping for some
kind of miracle. Slowly, with a sigh, Monsieur Langelet picked up the
receiver. He spoke in a calm, nasal voice, with a detachment, an irony,
that his friends-a small, very exclusive, very Parisian group—called
“inimitable.” Yes, he had decided to leave. No, he was not afraid of
anything. They would not defend Paris. Things would hardly be different
anywhere else. Danger was everywhere but it was not danger
he was fleeing. “I have seen two wars,” he said. He had in fact spent
the war of ‘14 at his property in Normandy, exempt from military
service because of his heart condition.<br><br>

“My dear friend, I am sixty years old, it is not death I fear!”<br><br>

“Why are you leaving, then?”<br><br>

“I cannot bear this chaos, these outbursts of hatred, the repulsive
spectacle of war. I shall withdraw to a tranquil spot, in the countryside,
and live on the bit of money I have left until everyone comes to
their senses.”<br><br>

He heard a little snigger: he had the reputation of being miserly
and cautious. “Charlie?” people said about him. “He sews gold coins
into all his old clothes.” He smiled, an icy, bitter smile. He knew very
well that people envied his luxurious, comfortable life.<br><br>

“Oh, you’ll be fine!” his friend exclaimed. “But not everyone has
your money, unfortunately...”<br><br>

Charlie frowned: he found her lacking in tact.<br><br>

“Where will you go?” the voice continued.
“To a little house I own in Ciboure.”<br><br>

<b>[p.38]</b><br><br>

“Near the border?” asked his friend, who was clearly losing her
composure.<br><br>

They parted coldly. Charlie again knelt down next to the half-full
packing case and caressed, through the straw and tissue paper, his
Nankin Cups, his Wedgwood centrepiece, his Sèvres vases. As long
as he lived he would never part with them, never. But his heart was
aching; he would not be able to take the dressing table in his bedroom,
made of Dresden china, a museum piece, with its trumeau
mirror decorated with roses. That would be left to the wolves. He remained
still for a moment, squatting down on the floor, his monocle
hanging almost to the ground by its black cord. He was tall and
strong; on the delicate skin of his head, his fair hair was arranged
with infinite care. Usually his face had the smooth, defiant look of an
old cat purring by a warm stove, but he was so tired from the previous
day that it couldn’t but show and his weak jaw suddenly drooped
like a corpse. What had she said, that stuck-up madam on the telephone?
She had insinuated that he wanted to flee France! What an
imbecile! Did she think she would upset him, make him ashamed? Of
course he would leave. If he could just get to Hendaye, he could
make arrangements to cross the border. He would stay briefly in
Lisbon and then get out of this hideous Europe, dripping with blood.
He could picture it: a decomposing corpse, slashed with a thousand
wounds. He shuddered. He wasn’t cut out for this. He wasn’t made
for the world that would be born of this rotting cadaver, like a worm
emerging from a grave. A brutal, ferocious, dog-eat-dog world.
He looked at his beautiful hands, which had never done a day’s
work, had only ever caressed statues, pieces of antique silver, leather
books, or occasionally a piece of Elizabethan furniture. What would
he, Charles Langelet, with his sophistication, his scruples, his
nobility-which was the essence of his character-what would he do
amid this demented mob? He would be robbed, skinned, murdered
like a pitiable dog thrown to the wolves. He smiled slightly, bitterly,
imagining himself as a golden-haired Pekinese lost in a jungle. He
wasn’t like ordinary men. Their ambitions, their fears, their cowardice
and their complaints were foreign to him. He lived in a universe
of light and peace. He was destined to be hated and betrayed by <b>[p.39]</b> 
everyone. He then remembered his servants and snorted. It was the
dawn of a new age, a warning and an omen! With difficulty, for the
joints in his knees were painful, he stood up, rubbed the small of his
back with his hands and went to his office to get the hammer and nails
to close up the packing case. He took it down to the car himself: there
was no need for the concierge to know what he was carrying.<br><br>

<b>[p.40]</b><br>

<h2>8</h2><br><br>

The Michauds got up at five o’clock in the morning to have enough
time to clean their apartment thoroughly before leaving. It was of
course strange to take so much care over things with so little value
and destined, in all probability, to be destroyed when the first bombs
fell on Paris. All the same, thought Madame Michaud, you dress and
adorn the dead who are destined to rot in the earth. It’s a final homage,
a supreme proof of love to those we hold dear. And this little
apartment was very dear to them. They’d lived here for sixteen years.
No matter how hard they tried, they could never take all their memories
with them: the best memories would remain here, between these
thin walls. They put their books away at the bottom of a cupboard
along with the sentimental family photographs, the kind you always
promise to put into albums but which are left in a mess, faded, caught
in the groove of a drawer. The picture of Jean-Marie as a child had
already been slipped deep inside the suitcase, in the folds of a spare
dress. The bank had firmly instructed they take only what was strictly
necessary: a bit of clothing and some toiletries. Everything was finally
ready. They’d eaten. Madame Michaud covered the bed with a
big sheet to protect its slightly faded pink silk upholstery from the
dust.<br><br>

“It’s time to go,” her husband said.<br><br>

“Go ahead, I’ll catch up with you,” she said, her voice faltering.<br><br>

He went out, leaving her alone. She went into Jean-Marie’s room.
Everything was silent, dark, funereal behind the closed shutters. She
knelt for a moment beside his bed, said out loud “Dear God, protect
him,” then closed the door and went down.<br><br>

Her husband was waiting for her on the stairs. He drew her close,
and then, without saying a word, hugged her so tightly that she let
out a little cry of pain: “Maurice, you’re hurting me!”<br><br>

<b>[p.41]</b><br><br>

“Sorry,” he murmured, his voice husky.<br><br>

At the bank, the employees assembled in the large entrance hall,
each one with a little bag on his knees, whispering the latest news to
one another. Corbin wasn’t there. The manager was giving out numbers:
they had to get into the car assigned to them when their number
was called. Until noon, departures were carried out in an orderly
fashion and in almost total silence. Then Corbin came in, impatient
and sullen. He went down to the basement, into the room where the
safes were kept, and came back up with a package which he held half
hidden beneath his coat.<br><br>

“That’s Arlette’s jewellery,” Madame Michaud whispered to her
husband. “He took out his wife’s two days ago.”<br><br>

“As long as he doesn’t forget us.” Maurice gave a sigh that was
both ironic and anxious.<br><br>

Madame Michaud deliberately stood in Corbin’s way. “You’re still
planning to take us with you, aren’t you, Monsieur?”<br><br>

He nodded yes and asked them to follow him. Monsieur Michaud
grabbed their suitcase and the three of them went outside. Monsieur
Corbin’s car was waiting, but as they got closer, Michaud narrowed
his short-sighted eyes. “I see our seats have been taken,” he said
quietly.<br><br>

Arlette Corail, her dog and her luggage were piled up in the back
of the car. Furiously, she opened the door and shouted, “Are you
going to throw me out on to the street, then?”<br><br>

The couple started bickering. The Michauds moved back a few
steps, but could still hear every word.<br><br>

“But we’re supposed to meet my wife in Tours,” Corbin finally
shouted, kicking the dog.<br><br>

It gave a little yelp and hid under Arlette’s legs.<br><br>

“You brute!”<br><br>

“Oh, do shut up, will you! If you hadn’t been gadding about the
day before yesterday with those English pilots ... two more I’d like
to see at the bottom of the ocean...”<br><br>

“You brute! Brute!” she repeated over and over again, her voice
growing shriller and shriller. Then suddenly, with the utmost calm,
she said, “I have a friend in Tours. I won’t need you once we get
there.”<br><br>

<b>[p.42]</b><br><br>

Corbin gave her a savage look but seemed to have made up his
mind. He turned towards the Michauds. “I’m sorry, there isn’t
enough room for you, as you can see. Madame Corail’s car was in an
accident and she has asked me to take her with me to Tours. I cannot
refuse. There’s a train in an hour. It will probably be a bit of a crush
but it’s a very short journey ... Whatever happens, make sure you
manage to join us as soon as possible. I am counting on you, Madame
Michaud. You are more energetic than your husband and, speaking of
which, Michaud, you must really try to be more dynamic”—he
stressed the syllables “dy-nam-ic”—”than recently. I will no longer
tolerate your attitude. If you want to keep your job, take this as a
warning. Both of you must be in Tours the day after tomorrow at the
latest. I must have all my staff.”<br><br>

He waved them away, got into the car next to the dancer and drove
off. The Michauds were left standing on the pavement, looking at
each other.<br><br>

“Well, that’s the way to do it,” Michaud said, lightly shrugging his
shoulders, his voice nonchalant. “Give the people you should be
apologising to a good telling off, that’s it!”<br><br>

In spite of themselves, they started to laugh.<br><br>

“What are we going to do now?”<br><br>

“We’re going to go home and have lunch,” his wife said, furious.<br><br>

It was cool back in their apartment, the kitchen without many provisions,
the furniture covered up. Everything seemed secretive, friendly
and sweet, as if a voice had whispered from the shadows, “We were
expecting you. Everything is as it should be.”<br><br>

“Let’s stay in Paris,” Maurice suggested.<br><br>

They were side by side on the sitting-room sofa and, with a familiar
gesture, she stroked his forehead with her thin, delicate fingers.
“My poor darling, that’s not possible. We have to live and we haven’t
any savings left since my operation, as you know only too well. I only
have one hundred seventy-five francs in my account. Don’t you think
Corbin would jump at the chance to get rid of us? After a blow like
this, all the branches are going to reduce their staff. We must get to
Tours at all costs!”<br><br>

“I think that will be impossible.”<br><br>

<b>[p.43]</b><br><br>

“We have to,” she repeated.<br><br>

She was already standing up, putting her hat back on, picking up
the suitcase again. They left and headed for the train station.<br><br>

They would never manage to get inside the large departure area; it
was closed, locked, blocked off by soldiers and by the jostling crowd
crushed against the barriers. They stayed until evening, struggling in
vain. All around them people were saying, “Too bad. We’ll have to
walk.”<br><br>

Everyone spoke with a kind of devastated astonishment. They
clearly didn’t believe what they were saying. They looked around
and expected some miracle: a car, a truck, anything that would take
them. But nothing came. So they headed out of Paris on foot, past the
city gates, dragging their bags behind them in the dust, then on into
the suburbs, into the countryside, all the while thinking, “This can’t
be happening! I must be dreaming!”<br><br>

Like all the others, the Michauds started walking. It was a warm
June evening. In front of them a woman in mourning, wearing a
black crepe hat askew over her white hair, stumbled on the stones in
the road and, gesturing like a madwoman, muttered, “Pray and give
thanks that we’re not fleeing in winter ... Pray ... Just pray!”<br><br>

<h2>9</h2><br><br>

Gabriel Corte and Florence spent the night of 11 June in their car.
They had arrived in the town at about six o’clock in the evening and
the only accommodation left was two hot little rooms right under the
roof of the hotel. Gabriel strode angrily through the rooms, pushed
open the windows, leaned out for a moment over the bright safety
rail, then pulled his head back in, saying in a curt voice, “I am not
staying here.”<br><br>

“We have nothing else, Monsieur, I’m very sorry,” said the manager,
his face pale and exhausted. “Just think, with all these crowds of
refugees, people are even sleeping on the billiard table. I was trying
to do you a favour!”<br><br>

“I am not staying here,” Gabriel repeated, stressing each word as
he did at the end of discussions with editors when he shouted at them
from the doorstep: “Under these circumstances, it will be impossible
for us to reach an agreement, Monsieur!” The editor would then
weaken and increase his offer from 80,000 to 100,000 francs.<br><br>

But the manager just shook his head sadly. “There’s nothing else,
nothing at all.”<br><br>

“Do you know who I am?” Gabriel asked, dangerously calm all of
a sudden. “I am Gabriel Corte and I’m telling you that I would rather
sleep in my car than in this rat hole.”<br><br>

“When you leave, Monsieur Corte,” replied the offended manager,
“you’ll find ten families on the landing, begging on their knees
for me to rent them these rooms.”<br><br>

Corte let out a loud laugh, overdramatic, icy and scornful. “I certainly
won’t be fighting for them. Adieu, Monsieur.”<br><br>

To no one, not even to Florence who was waiting downstairs in
the lobby, would he ever admit the real reason he had turned down
<b>[p.44]</b> the rooms. In the fading light of the June evening, he had seen a
petrol depot from the window; it was close to the hotel and, a little
further away, what looked like tanks and armoured cars were parked
in the town square.<br><br>

“We’ll be bombed!” he thought, and he started trembling all over,
so suddenly, so profoundly that he felt ill. Was it fear? Gabriel Corte?
No, he couldn’t be afraid! Don’t be ridiculous! He smiled with pity
and scorn, as if replying to some invisible person. Of course he
wasn’t afraid, but as he leaned out of the window once more, he
looked up at the dark sky: at any moment it could rain fire and death
upon him, and that horrible feeling shot through him again, first the
trembling right down to his bones, then the kind of weakness, nausea
and tensing in the stomach you feel before you faint. He didn’t care
whether he was afraid or not! He rushed outside, Florence and the
maid following behind.<br><br>

“We’ll sleep in the car,” he said, “it’s just one night.”<br><br>

Later on, it occurred to him that he could have tried another
hotel, but by the time he’d made up his mind, it was too late. An
endless, slow-moving river flowed from Paris: cars, trucks, carts, bicycles,
along with the horse-drawn traps of farmers who had abandoned
their land to flee south, their children and cattle trailing
behind. By midnight there wasn’t a single free room in all of Orleans,
not a single bed. People were sleeping on the floor in cafes, in the
streets, in the railway stations, their heads resting on suitcases. There
was so much traffic that it was impossible to get out of the city.
People were saying that a roadblock had been set up to keep the road
free for the troops.<br><br>

Silently, with no lights on, cars kept coming, one after the other,
full to bursting with baggage and furniture, prams and birdcages,
packing cases and baskets of clothes, each with a mattress tied firmly
to the roof. They looked like mountains of fragile scaffolding and
they seemed to move without the aid of a motor, propelled by their
own weight down the sloping streets to the town square. Cars filled
all the roads into the square. People were jammed together like fish
caught in a net, and one good tug on that net would have picked them
all up and thrown them down on to some terrifying river bank. There <b>[p.46]</b> 
was no crying br shouting; even the children were quiet. Everything
seemed calm. From time to time a face would appear over a lowered
window and stare up at the sky for a while, wondering. A low, muffled
murmur rose up from the crowd, the sound of painful breathing,
sighs and conversations held in hushed voices, as if people were
afraid of being overheard by an enemy lying in wait. Some tried to
sleep, heads leaning on the corner of a suitcase, legs aching on a narrow
bench or a warm cheek pressed against a window. Young men
and women called to one another from the cars and sometimes
laughed. Then a dark shape would glide across the star-covered sky,
everyone would look up and the laughter would stop. It wasn’t exactly
what you’d call fear, rather a strange sadness-a sadness that
had nothing human about it any more, for it lacked both courage and
hope. This was how animals waited to die. It was the way fish caught
in a net watch the shadow of the fisherman moving back and forth
above them.<br><br>

The plane above their heads had appeared suddenly; they could
hear its thin, piercing sound fading away, disappearing, then surging
up again to drown out the thousand sounds of the city. Everyone held
their breath. The river, the metal bridge, the railway tracks, the train
station, the factory’s chimneys all glimmered; they were nothing more
than “strategic positions,” targets for the enemy to hit. Everything
seemed dangerous to this silent crowd. “I think it’s a French plane!”
said the optimists. French or enemy, no one really knew. But it was
disappearing now. Sometimes they could hear a distant explosion. “It
didn’t hit us,” they would think, sighing with happiness. “It didn’t hit
us, it’s aimed at someone else. We’re so lucky!”<br><br>

“What a night! What a terrible night!” Florence groaned.<br><br>

In a barely audible voice, which slipped through his clenched lips
with a kind of whistle, Gabriel hissed at her as you would to a dog,
“I’m not asleep, am I? Do what I’m doing.”<br><br>

“For heaven’s sake, we could have had a room! We had the unbelievable
luck to find a room!”<br><br>

“You call that unbelievable luck? That disgusting attic, which
reeked of lice and bad drains. Didn’t you notice it was right above the
kitchen? Me, stay there? Can you picture me in there?”<br><br>

<b>[p.47]</b><br><br>


“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Gabriel, don’t be so proud.”
“Leave me alone, won’t you! I have always felt it, there are nuances,
there is a...” he was looking for the right word “... a sense of
decency which you simply cannot feel.”<br><br>

“What I can feel is my painful arse,” shouted Florence, suddenly
forgetting the past five years of her life and slapping her ring-covered
hand vigorously against her thigh in the most crass way. “Oh, for
goodness sake, I’ve had enough!”<br><br>

Gabriel turned towards her, his face white with fury, nostrils flaring.
“Get the hell out! Go on, get the hell out! I’m throwing you out!”<br><br>

At that very moment a bright light lit up the town square. It was a
missile shot from a plane. The words froze on Gabriel’s lips. The missile
disappeared but the sky was filled with planes. They flew back
and forth above the town square in a manner that seemed almost lazy.<br><br>

“What about <i>our</i> planes, where are ours?” people groaned.<br><br>

To Corte’s left was a miserable little car carrying a mattress on its
roof, along with a heavy round gueridon table with vulgar bronze
mounts. A man in a peaked cap and two women were sitting inside;
one woman had a child on her lap and the other a birdcage. It looked
as if they had been in an accident on the way. The car’s bodywork
was scratched, the bumper hanging off and the fat woman
holding the birdcage against her chest had bandages wrapped round
her head.<br><br>

On his right was a truck full of the kind of crates villagers use to
transport poultry on Fair days but which now were full of bundles of
old clothes: Through the car window right next to his, Gabriel could
see the face of an old prostitute with painted eyes, messy orange hair,
a low angular forehead. She stared at him long and hard while chewing
on a bit of bread. He shuddered. “Such ugliness,” he murmured,
“such hideous faces!” Overcome, he turned round to face inside the
car and closed his eyes.<br><br>

“I’m hungry,” Florence said. “Are you?”<br><br>

He gestured no.<br><br>

She opened the overnight case and took out some sandwiches.
“You didn’t have dinner. Corne on. Be sensible.”<br><br>

“I cannot eat,” he said. “I don’t think I could swallow a single <b>[p.48]</b>
mouthful now. Did you see that horrible old woman beside us with
her birdcage and bloodstained bandages?”<br><br>

Florence took a sandwich and shared the others with the maid and
driver. Gabriel covered his ears with his long hands so he couldn’t
hear the crunching noises the servants made as they bit into the
bread.<br><br>

<b>[p.49]</b><br><br>
<h2>10</h2><br><br>

The Péricands had been travelling for nearly a week and had been
dogged by misfortune. They’d had to stay in Gien for two days when
the car broke down. Further along, amid the confusion and unimaginable
crush, the car had hit the truck carrying the servants and luggage.
That was near Nevers. Fortunately for the Péricands, there was
no part of the provinces where they couldn’t find some friend or relative
with a large house, beautiful gardens and a well-stocked larder. A
cousin from the Maltête-Lyonnais side of the family put them up for
two days. But panic was intensifying, spreading like wildfire from
one city to another. They had the car repaired as best they could and
set out once more, but by noon on Saturday it was clear the car could
go no further without a thorough overhaul. The Péricands stopped in
a small town just off the main highway where they hoped to find a
room. But all sorts of vehicles were already blocking the streets. The
sound of creaking brakes filled the air and the ground next to the
river looked like a gypsy camp. Exhausted men were sleeping on
the grass, others were getting dressed. A young woman had hung a
mirror on a tree trunk and was putting on make-up and combing her
hair. Someone else was washing nappies in the fountain.<br><br>

The townspeople had come out on to their doorsteps and surveyed
the scene with utter amazement. “Those poor people! But honestly,
they look so awful!” they said, with pity and a secret feeling of satisfaction:
these refugees came from Paris, the north, the east, areas
doomed to invasion and war. But they were all right, time would pass,
soldiers would fight while the ironmonger on the main street and Mile
Dubois, the hatmaker, would continue to sell saucepans and ribbons;
they would eat hot soup in their kitchens and every evening close the
little wooden gates that separated their gardens from the rest of the
world.<br><br>

<b>[p.50]</b><br><br>

The cars were waiting for morning to fill up with petrol. It was
already becoming scarce. The townspeople asked the refugees for
news. No one knew anything. “They’re waiting for the Germans in
the Morvan Mountains,” someone said. Such an idea was greeted
with scepticism.<br><br>

“Come on, they didn’t get that far in ‘14,” said the fat chemist,
shaking his head, and everyone agreed, as if the blood spilled in ‘14
had formed some mystical barrier to keep the enemy out for ever.<br><br>

More cars arrived, and still more.<br><br>

“They look so tired, so hot!” everyone kept saying, but not one of
them thought to open their doors, to invite one of these wretches inside,
to welcome them into the shady bits of heaven that the refugees
could glimpse behind the houses, where wooden benches nestled
in arbours amid redcurrant bushes and roses. There were just too
many of them. Too many weary, pale faces, dripping with sweat,
too many wailing children, too many trembling lips asking, “Do
you know where we could get a room? A bed?” ... “Would you tell
us where we could find a restaurant, please, Madame?” It prevented
the townspeople from being charitable. There was nothing human
left in this miserable mob; they were like a herd of frightened animals.
Their crumpled clothes, crazed faces, hoarse voices, everything
about them made them look peculiarly alike, so you couldn’t tell them
apart. They all made the same gestures, said the same words. Getting
out of the cars, they would stumble a bit as if drunk, putting their
hands to their throbbing temples. “My God, what a journey!” they
sighed. “Hey, don’t we look gorgeous?” they asked with a giggle.
“They say things are a lot better over there,” they would say, pointing
over their shoulders to somewhere lost in the distance.<br><br>

Madame Péricand’s convoy had stopped at a little cafe near the
railway station. They got out their basket of food and ordered some
beer. At the next table, a beautiful little boy, very elegantly dressed
but whose green coat was all crumpled, was calmly eating some bread
and butter. On a chair next to him was a clothes basket in which a
baby lay crying. With her experienced eye, Madame Péricand could
tell immediately that these children came from a good family and that
it would be all right to speak to them. So she talked kindly to the little
<b>[p.51]</b> boy and made conversation with the mother when she came back;
she was from Reims, and looked enviously at the substantial snack
the Péricand children were eating.<br><br>

“Can I have some chocolate with my bread, Mummy?” said the
little boy in green.
“My poor darling!” said the young woman, putting the baby on
her lap to try to calm him down, “I don’t have any. I didn’t have time
to buy some. You’ll have a lovely dessert tonight at grandmother’s.”<br><br>

“Would you allow me to offer you some biscuits?”<br><br>

“Oh, Madame! You are too kind!”<br><br>

“Don’t mention it...”<br><br>

The two women conversed cheerfully and graciously, with the
same gestures and smiles they used when being offered a petit four
and a cup of tea on any ordinary day. Meanwhile, the baby was
screaming; one after the other, refugees with their children, their baggage,
their dogs poured into the cafe. One of the dogs smelled Albert
in his basket and, barking excitedly, rushed under the Péricands’ table
where the little boy in green was calmly eating his biscuits.<br><br>

“Jacqueline, you have some lollipops in your bag,” said Madame
Péricand, with a discreet gesture and a look which meant “You know
very well you should share with those who are less fortunate than
you. Now is the time to put into practice what you have learned at
catechism.”<br><br>

She got a feeling of great satisfaction from seeing herself as possessing
such plenty and, at the same time, being so charitable. It was a
credit to her foresight and kindness. She offered the lollipops not only
to the little boy but to a Belgian family who had arrived in a truck
jammed with hen-coops. She threw in some pains aux raisins for the
children. Then she had some hot water brought to prepare the elder
Monsieur Péricand’s herbal tea.<br><br>

Hubert had gone to try to find some rooms. Madame Péricand
went out of the cafe to ask directions to the church in the middle of
the town. There, families were camping out on the pavement and on
the church’s large stone steps.<br><br>

The brand-new church was white and still smelled of fresh paint.
Inside, it embraced two different worlds: the normal world of daily
<b>[p.52]</b> routine and another existence, strange and feverish. In one corner, a
nun was changing the flowers at the feet of the Virgin Mary. A sweet,
calm smile on her face, she slowly removed the shrivelled stems and
replaced them with big bouquets of fresh roses. You could hear her
scissors clicking and her gentle footsteps on the flagstones. Then she
put out the candles. An elderly priest walked towards the confessional.
An old woman was sleeping on a chair, holding her rosary
beads. Many candles were lit in front of the statue of Joan of Arc.
Little flames danced in the strong sunlight, pale and clear against the
dazzling whiteness of the walls. Between two windows the golden
letters of the names of people who had died in 1914 shimmered on a
marble tablet.<br><br>

Meanwhile, an ever-increasing crowd rushed towards the church
like a wave. Women, children, all came to thank God for having arrived
safely or to pray for the journey ahead. Some were crying, others
were wounded, their heads or arms wrapped in bandages. Their
faces were mottled with red blotches, their clothes wrinkled, torn and
filthy, as if they had slept in them for several nights. Some were
sweating, large drops of sweat falling like tears through the grey dust
on their cheeks. The women pushed their way inside, threw themselves
into the church as into some inviolable sanctuary. Their agitation,
their frenzy, was so great that they seemed incapable of staying
still. They moved from one altar to another, knelt down, got up,
bumped into chairs with a timid, terrified look like night owls in a
room full of light. But little by little they calmed down, hid their faces
in their hands and, exhausted and with no tears left, finally found
peace in front of the large black crucifix.<br><br>

After saying her prayers, Madame Péricand left the church. Once
outside, she decided to restock her supply of biscuits, which had been
greatly diminished by her lavish generosity. She went into a large
grocer’s store.<br><br>

“We’ve got nothing left, Madame,” said the employee.<br><br>

“What? No shortbread, no gingerbread, nothing?”<br><br>

“Nothing at all, Madame. It’s all gone.”<br><br>

“Then let me have a pound of tea, Ceylon tea?”<br><br>

“There’s nothing, Madame.”<br><br>

<b>[p.53]</b><br><br>

They pointed out some other food shops to Madame Péricand, but
nowhere could she buy a thing. The refugees had cleaned out the
town. Hubert met her near the cafe. He hadn’t been able to find a
room.<br><br>

“There’s nothing to eat, the shops are empty!” she exclaimed.<br><br>

“Well,” said Hubert, “<i>I</i> found two shops full of goods.”<br><br>

“Really? Where?”<br><br>

Hubert burst out laughing. “There was one that sold pianos and
the other, things for funerals!”<br><br>

“You’re such a silly little boy,” said his mother.<br><br>

“At the rate we’re going,” Hubert remarked, “I imagine pearl
crowns will soon be in great demand. We could stock up on them,
what do you think, Mother?”<br><br>

Madame Péricand shrugged her shoulders. She could see Jacqueline
and Bernard on the doorstep of the cafe. Their hands were full of
chocolate and sweets that they were giving out to everyone around
them. Madame Péricand leapt towards them.<br><br>

“Get back inside! What are you doing out here? I forbid you to
touch the food. Jacqueline, you will be punished. Bernard, your father
will hear about this.” Grabbing the two stunned culprits firmly
by the hand, she dragged them away. Christian charity, the compassion
of centuries of civilisation, fell from her like useless ornaments,
revealing her bare, arid soul. She needed to feed and protect her own
children. Nothing else mattered any more.

<h2>11</h2><br><br>

Maurice and Jeanne Michaud walked one behind the other on the
wide road lined with poplar trees. Around them, behind them, in
front of them, people were fleeing. Occasionally the road rose more
steeply and they could see clearly the chaotic multitude trudging
through the dust, stretching far into the distance. The luckiest ones
had wheelbarrows, a pram, a cart made of four planks of wood set on
top of crudely fashioned wheels, bowing down under the weight of
bags, tattered clothes, sleeping children. These were the poor, the unlucky,
the weak, the sort who don’t know how to manage, who arealways
pushed to the back; the frightened, too, and the stingy, who had
put off buying a ticket until the last minute because of the price, the
expenses involved and the dangers of the journey, but who had suddenly
been gripped by panic just like everyone else. None of them
knew why they were bothering to flee: all of France was burning,
there was danger everywhere. Whenever they sank to the
ground, they said they would never get up again, they would die
right there, that if they had to die it was better to die in peace. But
they were the first to stand up when a plane flew near. They were
compassionate and kind, offering that active and attentive sympathy
that working people normally reserve for their own families or the
poor, and even then only at moments of the most exceptional fear
and misery. Nearly a dozen times, some of these big, strong women
had offered to help Jeanne Michaud to walk. Jeanne herself held children
by the hand while her husband carried bags on his shoulders:
sometimes a bundle of clothing, sometimes a basket with a live rabbit
and potatoes, the worldly possessions of a little old woman who had
left Nanterre on foot. In spite of the exhaustion, the hunger, the fear,
Maurice Michaud was not really unhappy. He had a unique way of
thinking: he didn’t consider himself that important; in his own eyes,
<b>[p.55]</b> he was not that rare and irreplaceable creature most people imagine
when they think about themselves. He felt pity towards his fellow
sufferers, but his pity was lucid and detached. After all, he thought,
these great human migrations seemed to follow natural laws. Surely
such occasional mass displacements were necessary to humans, just as
the migration of livestock was to animals. He found this idea oddly
comforting. The people around him believed that fate was tracking
them down, them and their pitiable generation; but not Maurice: he
knew there had been exoduses throughout history. How many people
had died on this land (on land everywhere in the world), dripping
with blood, fleeing the enemy, leaving cities in flames, clutching their
children to their hearts: no one gave a thought to these countless
dead, or pitied them. To their descendants they were no more important
than chickens who’d had their throats slit. As he walked along, he
imagined their plaintive ghosts rising up, leaning towards him, whispering
in his ear, “We’ve been through all this already, before you.
Why should you be more fortunate than us?”<br><br>

“There’s never been anything as horrible as this!” a big woman
next to him groaned.<br><br>

“On the contrary, Madame, on the contrary,” he replied quietly.<br><br>

They had been walking for three days when they saw the first regiments
in full flight. Confidence was so ingrained in the heart of the
French that when they saw these soldiers, the refugees thought a battle
was about to begin, that the High Command had given orders for
small groups to head for the front by a circuitous route, that the
armed forces were still intact. This hope kept them going. The soldiers
wouldn’t say much. Almost all of them were depressed and
pensive. Some slept in the backs of trucks. Tanks plodded forward in
the dust, camouflaged with thin branches. Between the leaves faded
by the burning sun, you could see their pale faces, weary, angry and
exhausted.<br><br>

Madame Michaud kept thinking she saw her son among them. Not
once did she see his regiment’s number, but a kind of hallucination
took hold of her. Every unfamiliar young face or voice caused her to
tremble so fiercely that she had to stop dead in her tracks, clutching
her heart and softly muttering, “Oh, Maurice, isn’t that...”<br><br>

“What’s wrong?”<br><br>

<b>[p.56]</b><br><br>

“No, it’s nothing...”<br><br>

But he was no fool. He shook his head. “You see your son everywhere,
my poor Jeanne!”<br><br>

All she did was sigh. “He does look like him, doesn’t he?”<br><br>

After all, it could happen. He could have cheated death; he could
suddenly appear at her side, her son, her Jean-Marie; he would call
out to them joyfully, tenderly, in that sweet masculine voice she could
still hear, “But what are you two doing here?”<br><br>

Oh, just to see him, to hold him close, to feel his cool rough cheek
beneath her lips, to see his beautiful eyes shining close to hers, his
deep expression, so alive. He had hazel eyes with long eyelashes like a
woman, eyes that saw so many things! She had always taught him to
see the funny and moving side of people. She liked to laugh and felt
sympathy for others. “It’s your Dickensian spirit, Mother,” he would
say. How well they knew each other! They would cheerfully, sometimes
cruelly, make fun of people who had been unkind to them; then
a word, a gesture, a sigh would make them stop. Maurice was different:
he was more serene, cooler. She loved and respected Maurice,
but Jean-Marie was ... Oh, my God, he was everything she wanted
to be and everything she dreamed of and everything that was the best
of her: her joy, her hope...” My son, my little love, my Jeannot,” she
thought, calling him by the nickname he’d had when he was five,
when she would take his head gently in her hands and kiss his ears, tilt
his head back and tickle him with her lips while he laughed and
laughed.<br><br>

Her thoughts became more and more feverish and confused the
longer she walked. She was a good walker: when she and Maurie
were younger, they had often gone rambling in the countryside during
their short holidays. When they didn’t have enough money to
stay in a hotel, they would set off like this with food and sleeping
bags in their rucksacks. This was why she suffered less fatigue than.
her companions. But this incessant kaleidoscope, these strange faces
passing endlessly before her, then fading and disappearing, was much
more painful than physical exhaustion. “A herd of horses,” she
thought, “trapped.” In the crowd, cars were tangled up like those
reeds you see floating on the river, anchored by invisible knots
while floodwater rushes all around them. Jeanne turned away so she
<b>[p.57]</b> couldn’t see the cars. They poisoned the air with their petrol fumes,
deafened the people on foot with their futile honking as they tried in
vain to clear a way through. Seeing the impotent rage or the gloomy
resignation on the drivers’ faces was a comfort to the refugees.
“They’re not going any faster than us!” they would say to each other,
enjoying the feeling of shared misfortune.<br><br>

The refugees were walking in small groups. Chance had thrown
them together at the edge of Paris and now they stayed together,
though they didn’t even know one another’s names. With the Michauds
was a tall, thin woman, wearing a cheap, shabby coat and a great deal
of costume jewellery. Jeanne vaguely wondered what would possess
someone to flee wearing enormous earrings encrusted with fake
pearls and diamonds, large red and green stones on her fingers and a
paste brooch with small bits of topaz.<br><br>

Then there was a concierge and her daughter, the mother small
and pale, the child big and heavy. They were both dressed in black
and dragged along amid their luggage a portrait of a large man with a
long black moustache. “My husband,” the woman said. “He’s the
caretaker at the cemetery.” Her sister was with her, pregnant and
pushing a sleeping child in a pram. She was very young. As each convoy
of soldiers passed by, she too would tremble and search the
crowd. “My husband is out there somewhere,” she would say; out
there somewhere, or perhaps out here ... anything was possible.<br><br>

And Jeanne would say, for the hundredth time no doubt-she really
had no idea what she was saying any more-” So is my son, so is
my son...”<br><br>

They hadn’t yet been shelled. When it happened, they didn’t
know what was going on at first. They heard the sound of an explosion,
then another, then shouting: “Run for it! Get down! Get down
on the ground!” They immediately threw themselves face down.<br><br>

“How grotesque we must look!” Jeanne mused. She wasn’t afraid,
but she was short of breath and her heart was pounding so violently
that she pressed both hands to it and pushed it down against a stone.
She could feel a bell-shaped pink flower brushing her lips. Later, she
would remember that while they were stretched out on the ground, a
small white butterfly was lazily flitting from one flower to another.<br><br>

Finally she heard a voice whisper, “It’s over; they’re gone.” She<br><br>

<b>[p.58]</b><br><br>

stood up and automatically brushed the dust from her skirt. No one,
she thought, had been hurt. But after walking for a few minutes, they
saw the first fatalities: two men and a woman. Their bodies had been
torn to shreds, but by chance their three faces were untouched. Such
gloomy, ordinary faces, with a dim, fixed, stunned expression as
if they were trying in vain to understand what was happening to
them; they weren’t made, my God, to die in battle, they weren’t made
for death. In all her life that woman had probably never said anything
but ordinary things, like “The leeks are getting bigger” or “Who’s
the dirty pig who got my floor all muddy?”<br><br>

But what do I know? Jeanne asked herself. Perhaps there was a
wealth of intelligence and tenderness behind their low brows, beneath
their dishevelled, lifeless hair. What are we in people’s eyes,
Maurice and I, other than two miserable employees? It’s true in a
way, but in another way, we are precious and unique. I know that too.
“What a horrible waste,” she thought again. She leaned against
Marurice ‘s shoulder, trembling, her cheeks wet with tears.<br><br>

“Let’s go,” he said, gently pulling her away.<br><br>

Both of them were thinking the same thing: “Why?” They would
never make it to Tours. Did the bank even exist any more? Was
Monsieur Corbin buried beneath the rubble with his files? With his
valuables? With his dancer? And his wife’s jewellery! But that would
be too good to be true, Jeanne thought with sudden ferociousness.
Nevertheless, she and Maurice hobbled along, continuing on their
way. All they could do was to keep walking and place themselves in
the hands of God.<br><br>

<b>[p.59]</b><br><br>


<h2>12</h2><br><br>

The little group made up of the Michauds and their companions was
picked up on Friday night. A military truck stopped for them and
they travelled through the night, lying among the crates, until they
arrived at a town whose name they never discovered. The railway
line was intact, they were told. They could go direct to Tours. Jeanne
went into the first house she saw on the outskirts of the town and
asked permission to wash. The kitchen was already full of refugees
rinsing their clothes in the sink, but they took Jeanne to the water
pump in the garden. Maurice had brought a little mirror on a small
chain; he hung it from the branch of a tree and shaved. Afterwards
they felt better, ready to face the long wait by the door of the barracks
where soup was being given out, and an even longer wait at the
third-class ticket window at the train station. They had eaten and
were crossing the square in front of the station when the bombs exploded.
Enemy planes had been flying above the town for the past
three days and air-raid warnings had been constant. The town had to
make do with an old fire siren to sound the alarm; through the din of
the cars, the screaming children, the noise of the terrified crowd, you
could barely hear its faint, ridiculous sound. The people arriving off
trains would ask, “Is it an air raid?” and be told, “No, it’s over,” only
for the faint bell to be heard again five minutes later. There was
laughter. Shops were open, little girls played hopscotch on the pavement
and dogs ran through the dust near the old cathedral. The
Italian and German planes were ignored as they glided calmly overhead.
People were used to them.<br><br>

Suddenly, one broke loose and swooped down at the crowd. He’s
going to crash, Jeanne thought, then, No, he’s going to fire, he’s firing,
we’re finished ... Instinctively, she covered her mouth to stifle a
scream. The bombs had fallen on the train station and, a bit further
<b>[p.60]</b> along, on the railway tracks. The glass roof shattered and exploded
outwards, wounding and killing the people in the square. Panic-stricken,
some of the women threw down their babies as if they were
cumbersome packages and ran. Others grabbed their children and
held them so tightly they seemed to want to force them back into the
womb, as if that were the only truly safe place. A wounded woman
was writhing around at Jeanne’s feet: it was the one with the costume
jewellery. Her throat and fingers were sparkling and blood was pouring
from her shattered skull. Her warm blood oozed on to Jeanne’s
dress, on to her shoes and stockings.<br><br>

But Jeanne was saved from thinking about the dead by the
wounded, who were calling for help from beneath the piles of shattered
stone and broken glass. She joined Maurice and some other men
who were trying to clear away the rubble. But it was too difficult for
her. She couldn’t do it. Then she remembered the children who were
wandering piteously about the square, looking for their mothers. She
called them over, took them by the hand and led them to the cathedral,
where she assembled them in the front portico. Then she returned
to the crowd. When she saw a frantic woman, screaming,
running back and forth, she would call out in a calm, loud voice, so
calm and loud that she herself was amazed, “The children are by the
church door. Go and get them, over there. Could everyone who has
lost their children please go and get them at the church.”<br><br>

The women rushed towards the cathedral. Sometimes they wept,
sometimes they burst out laughing, sometimes they let out a sort of
wild cry, a choking noise, like no other sound. The children were
much calmer. Their tears dried quickly. Their mothers carried them
away, holding them tightly. Nat one of them thought to thank
Jeanne. She went back into the square where she learned the town
had not suffered much damage. A hospital convoy had been hit just as
it was pulling into the station, but the line to Tours was still intact.
The train was getting ready right now and would leave in a quarter of
an hour. Immediately the dead and injured were forgotten; people
rushed towards the station clutching their suitcases and hatboxes like
life jackets. The Michauds spotted the first stretchers transporting the
wounded soldiers. Because of the crush it was impossible to get close
enough to see their faces. They were being piled into trucks and cars,
<b>[p.61]</b> both military and civilian, requisitioned in haste. Jeanne saw an officer
going towards a truck full of children, supervised by a priest. She
heard him say, “I’m terribly sorry, Father, but I must take this truck.
We have to get our wounded to Blois.”<br><br>

The priest motioned to the children who started to climb out.<br><br>

“I’m terribly sorry, Father,” the officer repeated. “A school, is it?”<br><br>

“An orphanage.”<br><br>

“I’ll send the truck back to you if I can get any petrol.”<br><br>

The children—teenagers between fourteen and eighteen—each
carrying a little suitcase, got out and formed a small group round the
priest.<br><br>

Maurice turned towards his wife. “Are you coming?”<br><br>

“Yes. Wait a minute.”<br><br>

“What is it?”<br><br>

She was trying to catch sight of the stretchers moving one after
the other through the crowd. But there were too many people: she
couldn’t see anything.<br><br>

Next to her another woman was also standing on tiptoe. Her lips
were moving but she made no sound: she was praying or repeating
someone’s name. She looked at Jeanne. “You always think you see
yours, don’t you?” she said.<br><br>

Jeanne sighed faintly. There was no reason at all why it should be
her son rather than another woman’s who appeared, suddenly, there
in front of her eyes, her son, her own, her beloved. Perhaps he was in
some peaceful spot? The most terrible battles leave some places untouched,
protected, despite being surrounded by fire.<br><br>

“Do you know where that train was coming from?” she asked the
woman next to her.<br><br>

“No.”<br><br>

“Are there many dead?”<br><br>

“They say there are two carriages full of casualties.”<br><br>

Jeanne gave in and let Maurice pull her away. With great difficulty
they made their way to the railway station. In places, they had to step
over stone slabs and piles of broken glass. They finally made it to
platform 3, where the train for Tours was getting ready to depart, a
small local train from the provinces, peaceful and black, puffing out
its smoke.<br><br>

<b>[p.62]</b><br><br>

It was two days since Jean-Marie had been wounded: he was in the
train that was bombed. He wasn’t hit, but the carriage caught fire. In
his attempt to get out of his seat and make it to the door, his wound
reopened. When he was picked up and hoisted into the truck, he was
only semi-conscious. He lay motionless on his stretcher; his head had
fallen sideways so that, at each jolt, it banged hard against an empty
crate. Three vehicles full of soldiers were moving slowly down a
road that had been machine-gunned and was hardly passable. Above
the convoy the enemy planes flew back and forth. Jean-Marie came
out of his delirium for a moment and thought, “This is how birds
must feel when the hawks circle above them...”<br><br>

In his confusion he could picture his nanny’s farm, where he used
to spend the Easter holidays as a child. The farmyard was bright with
sun: the chickens pecked at grain and hopped friskily about in the ash
pile; then his nanny’s large bony hand would snatch one of them, tie
its feet together and five minutes later ... that stream of blood and
that little gurgling sound. Grotesque. Death. “And me too; I’ve been
snatched and carried away,” he thought, “... snatched and carried
away ... and tomorrow, thin and naked, tossed into a grave, I’ll be as
ugly as that chicken...”<br><br>

His forehead banged against the crate with such force that he let
out a faint protest: he didn’t have the strength to cry out any more,
but it caught the attention of the soldier on the next stretcher,
wounded in the leg, but not too badly. “Hey, Michaud? What’s
wrong? Michaud, are you OK?”<br><br>

“Give me something to drink and get my head in a better position
and get this fly away from my eyes,” Jean-Marie wanted to say, but he
only sighed. “No.” And he closed his eyes. <br><br>

<b>[p.63]</b><br><br>

“They’re starting again,” groaned his friend.<br><br>

At that very moment more bombs fell around the convoy. A small
bridge was destroyed: the road to Blois was cut off; they would have
to retreat, clear a passage through the crowd of refugees, or go
through Vendome, but they wouldn’t make it there until nightfall.<br><br>

Poor lads, thought the Major, looking at Michaud, the worst off.
He gave him an injection. They started moving again. The two
trucks carrying the minor casualties crawled towards Vendome; the
one carrying Jean-Marie took a path through the fields to shorten the
journey by a few kilometres. The truck soon stopped, out of petrol.
The Major went to see if he could find a house in which to lodge his
men. They were away from the mass exodus here; the river of cars
was moving along the road down below. From the top of the hill, in
the periwinkle-blue twilight of this peaceful, tender June night, the
Major could see a black swarm from which arose a troubling sounddistinct
from the sound of car horns, cries and shouts-a muted, sinister
murmur that pierced the soul.<br><br>

The Major saw a row of farms. They were inhabited, but only by
women and children. The men were at the front. It was into one of
these farms that Jean-Marie was taken. The neighbouring houses
took in the other soldiers. The Major found a woman’s bicycle and
said he was going to the nearest town to get help, petrol, trucks, whatever
he could find...”If he has to die,” he thought, as he said goodbye
to Michaud who was still lying on the stretcher in the farm’s large
kitchen while the women prepared and warmed up a bed, “if he can’t
go on, he’s better off between two clean sheets than on the road...”<br><br>

He cycled towards Vendome. It took him the whole night and,
when he was about to enter the town, he fell into the hands of the
Germans, who took him prisoner. However, realising that he wasn’t
coming back, the women had already rushed to the village to warn
the doctor and nurses at the hospital. But the hospital was full of the
victims of the last bombing, so the soldiers remained in the hamlet.
The women complained: with the men gone, they had enough work
to do in the fields and looking after the animals without having to take
care of these wounded men who’d been dropped on them!<br><br>

Jean-Marie, burning with fever, painfully opened his eyes and saw <b>[p.64]</b> 
an old woman with a long, sallow nose at the foot of his bed, knitting
and sighing as she watched him: “If I could just be sure that my old
man, wherever he is, the poor bloke, was being looked after like this
one who means nothing to me...” Through his confused dream he
could hear the clicking of the steel knitting needles. The ball of wool
was bouncing on his blanket; in his delirium he thought it had pointed
ears and a tail, and he stretched out his hand to stroke it. Now and
again the woman’s adopted daughter would stand close to him; she
was young, with a fresh, rosy face, slightly heavy features and lively
brown eyes. One day she brought him a bunch of cherries and put
them next to him on the pillow. He was not allowed to eat them, but
he pressed them against his burning cheeks and felt content and almost
happy.<br><br>

<b>[p.65]</b><br><br>

<h2>14</h2><br><br>

Corte and Florence had left Orleans and were driving towards
Bordeaux. Things were complicated, however, by the fact that they
didn’t know exactly where they were going. First they had headed
towards Brittany, but then decided to go south, to the Midi. And now
Gabriel was saying that he wanted to leave France altogether.<br><br>

“We’ll never get out alive,” said Florence.<br><br>

What she resented, more than the weariness and fear, was her
anger-a blind, maddening rage that rose up from inside to suffocate
her. She felt that Gabriel had broken the tacit agreement that bound
them together. After all, for a man and woman in their position, and
at their age, love was a contract. She had given herself to him because
she hoped he would take care of her-not just materially but emotionally.
Until now she had been dutifully repaid: he had given her
wealth and prestige. But suddenly he seemed to her a weak and despicable
creature.<br><br>

“And would you care to tell me just what we would do abroad?
What we would live on? All your money is here, since you were foolish
enough to have the whole lot sent back from London, not that I’ve
ever understood why!”<br><br>

“Because I thought England was more under threat than us. I had
faith in my country, in my country’s army. Surely you’re not going to
reproach me for that? Besides, what are you so worried about? You
know I’m famous everywhere-thank God!”<br><br>

He stopped speaking suddenly, pressed his face against the window
and jerked his head back, annoyed.<br><br>

“What is it now?” mumbled Florence, raising her eyes to heaven.<br><br>

“Those people...” He pointed to the car that had just overtaken
them. Florence looked at the people inside. It was the group they had 
<b>[p.66]</b> spent the night parked next to in the town square in Orleans. She
recognised them right away-the dented car, the man in the cap, the
woman with the child on her lap and the one with the birdcage whose
head was wrapped in bandages.<br><br>

“Oh, stop looking at them!” said Florence wearily.<br><br>

Corte had been leaning on a small travel case decorated in gold
and ivory. Now he struck it forcefully with his hand several times. “If
events as painful as defeat and mass exodus cannot be dignified with
some sort of nobility, some grandeur, then they shouldn’t happen at
all! I will. not accept that these shopkeepers, these caretakers, these
filthy people with their whining, their malicious gossip, their vulgarity,
should be allowed to debase this atmosphere of tragedy. Just look
at them! Look at them! There they are again. They’re honking at me,
for goodness sake! ... Henri, drive faster, won’t you!” he shouted to
the driver. “Can’t you shake off this riff-raff?”<br><br>

Henri didn’t even reply. The car moved forward three metres,
then stopped, caught up in the unimaginable confusion of vehicles,
bicycles and pedestrians. Once again Gabriel saw the woman with the
bandaged head only a short distance away. She had thick, dark eyebrows,
long, white, closely set teeth and hairs dotted about her upper
lip. Her bandages were bloodstained, her black hair matted on the
cotton wool and cloth. Gabriel shuddered in disgust and turned away,
but the woman was actually smiling at him and trying to make conversation.<br><br>

“Hey! It’s not moving very fast, is it?” she said politely through
the lowered window. “But it’s still a good thing we came this way.
You should see the damage the bombing’s done on the other side!
They’ve destroyed all the chateaux of the Loire, Monsieur...”<br><br>

She finally noticed Gabriel’s icy stare and went silent.<br><br>

“You see,” he muttered to Florence, “I can’t get away from them!”<br><br>

“Stop looking at them.”<br><br>

“As if it’s that easy! What a nightmare! Oh, the ugliness, the vulgarity,
the horrible crudeness of these people!”<br><br>

They were getting close to Tours. Gabriel had been yawning for
some time: he was hungry. He’d hardly eaten anything since Orleans.
Just like Byron, Corte used to say, he was a man of frugal habits, <b>[p.67]</b>
content with vegetables, fruit and mineral water; but once or twice a
week he needed a large, filling meal. He felt that need now. He remained
motionless, silent, eyes closed, his handsome pale face ravaged
by an expression of suffering like at those moments when he
conceived the first neat, pure sentences of his books (he liked them as
light and rustling as cicadas at first, then passionate and sonorous; he
talked about his “violins” – “Let’s make my violins sing,” he would
say). But other worries took hold of him tonight. He pictured with
extraordinary intensity the sandwiches Florence had offered him in
Orleans: they had seemed rather unappetising then, a bit soggy because
of the heat. There had been some small sweet rolls with foie
gras, black bread garnished with cucumber and lettuce, which would
be deliciously cool and refreshing. He yawned again. Opening the
case, he found a dirty napkin and a jar of gherkins.<br><br>

“What are you looking for?” asked Florence.<br><br>

“A sandwich.”<br><br>

“There aren’t any left.”<br><br>

“What do you mean? There were three of them in here a while
ago.”<br><br>

“The mayonnaise was runny, they were ruined, I threw them
away. We can have dinner in Tours ... I hope,” she added.<br><br>

They could see the outskirts of Tours in the distance but the cars
weren’t moving; a barricade had been set up at one of the crossroads.
Everyone had to wait their turn. A whole hour went by like this.
Gabriel was growing paler. It wasn’t sandwiches he was dreaming of
now, but light, warming soup, or the buttery pates he’d once had in
Tours. (He had been coming back from Biarritz with a woman.) It
was odd, he couldn’t remember her name any more, or her face; the
only thing that stuck in his memory were the smooth, rich little pates,
each with a slice of truffle tucked away inside. Then he started thinking
about meat: a great red slab of rare beef, with a curl of butter
melting slowly over its tender flesh. What a delight ... Yes, that was
what he needed ... roast beef ... sirloin ... fillet ... a pork cutlet or
mutton chop at a pinch. He sighed deeply.

It was a light, golden evening, with no trace of wind or heat-the
end of a divine day. A soft shadow spread over the fields and <b>[p.68]</b>
pathways, like the shadow cast by the wing of a bird. From the nearby
woods the faint perfume of strawberries wafted up now and then
through the petrol fumes and smoke. The cars inched towards a
bridge. Women were calmly washing their clothes in the river. The
horror and strangeness of recent events were softened by these images
of peace. Far away, a watermill turned its wheel.<br><br>

“There must be fish here,” Gabriel mused. Two years before, in
Austria, he had eaten fresh trout near a small river as clear and rapid
as this one. Their flesh, beneath the bluish, pearly skin, had been as
pink as a small child’s. And those steamed potatoes ... so simple, traditional,
with a bit of fresh butter and chopped parsley ... He looked
hopefully at the walls of the town. Finally, finally, they were there.
But as soon as he put his head out of the window he saw the long line
of refugees waiting in the street. A soup kitchen was giving out food
to the hungry, they were told, but
there was nothing to eat anywhere
else.
A well-dressed woman, holding a child by the hand, turned
towards Gabriel and Florence. “We’ve been here for four hours,” she
said. “My child won’t stop screaming. It’s awful...”<br><br>

“Awful,” Florence repeated.<br><br>

Behind them the woman with the bandaged head appeared.
“There’s no point in waiting. They’re closing. There’s nothing left.”
She made a small dismissive gesture with her hand. “Nothing, nothing.
Not even a crust of bread. My friend who’s with me, who just
gave birth three weeks ago, hasn’t had anything to eat since yesterday
and she’s breast-feeding her kid. And they tell you to have children,
dammit. Children, sure! Don’t make me laugh!”<br><br>

A murmur of despair ran through the long queue.<br><br>

“Nothing, they have nothing left, nothing. They’re saying ‘Come
back tomorrow.’ They’re saying the Germans are getting closer, that
the regiment is leaving tonight.”<br><br>

“Did you go into the town to see if there’s anything there?”
“You must be joking! Everyone’s leaving, it’s like a ghost town.
Some people are already hoarding, I’m sure.”
“Awful,” Florence groaned again.<br><br>

In her distress she was talking to the occupants of the battered car.
The woman with the child on her lap was as pale as death. <b>[p.69]</b> 
The other one shook her head gloomily. “That’s nothing. They’re
all rich, they are, it’s the workers that suffer the most.”<br><br>

“What are we going to do?” said Florence, turning towards
Gabriel with a gesture of despair. He motioned to her to move away
from the crowd and began striding along. The town was full of
closed shutters and locked doors; there wasn’t a single lamp shining
or a soul to be seen at the windows. But, the moon had just risen and
by its light it was easy to find one’s way.<br><br>

“You understand,” he whispered, “it’s farcical, all this ... It is impossible
not to find something to eat if we pay. Believe me, there’s
this panic-stricken herd and then there are the sly devils who have
hidden food away in a safe place. We’ve just got to find them.” He
stopped. “We’re in Paray-le-Monial, aren’t we? See, here’s what I’ve
been looking for. I had dinner in this restaurant two years ago. The
owner will remember me, you’ll see.” He banged on the padlocked
door and called out in a commanding voice, “Open up, open up, my
good man! It’s a friend!”<br><br>

And the miracle happened. They heard footsteps; a key turned in
the lock, an anxious face appeared.<br><br>

“Look here, you know who I am, don’t you? I’m Corte, Gabriel
Corte. I’m famished, my friend ... Yes, yes, I know there’s nothing,
but for me ... if you look carefully ... Don’t you have anything left?
Ah! Yes! You remember me now!”<br><br>

“I’m sorry, Sir, I can’t let you in,” whispered the owner. “I’d be
mobbed! Go down to the corner and wait for me. I’ll meet you there.
I’d really like to help you, Monsieur Corte, but we’re so low on provisions,
so desperate. But maybe if I look carefully .. .”<br><br>

“Yes, that’s it, look carefully...”<br><br>

“But you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? You can’t imagine
what’s been going on here today. It’s been madness, my wife is sick
about it. They devour everything and leave without paying!”<br><br>

‘‘I’m counting on you, my friend,” said Gabriel, slipping some
money into his hand.<br><br>

Five minutes later he and Florence went back to the car, carrying a
mysterious basket wrapped in a linen napkin.<br><br>

“I have no idea what’s inside,” muttered Gabriel in the same detached,
dreamy tone he used when speaking to women, to women he <b>[p.70]</b> 
desired but still hadn’t conquered. “No, no idea at all ... but I think I
can smell foie gras.”<br><br>

Just at that moment a shadowy figure passed between Gabriel and
Florence and grabbed the basket they were holding, separating them
with a blow. Florence, panic-stricken, grasped her neck with both
hands, shouting, “My necklace, my necklace!” But her necklace was
still there, as well as the jewellery box they were carrying. The
thieves had only taken their food. She made her way back safe and
sound to Gabriel, who was dabbing at his painful jaw and nose, and
muttering over and over again, “It’s a jungle, we’re trapped in a
jungle...”<br><br>

<b>[p.71]</b><br><br>

<h2>15</h2><br><br>

“You shouldn’t have done it,” the woman holding the newborn baby
in her arms sighed.<br><br>

A bit of colour gradually returned to her cheeks. The old battered
Citroen had managed quite well to manoeuvre its way out of the
crowd and its occupants were resting on the mossy ground in a little
wood. The moon, round and flawless, was gleaming, but even without
the moon the vast fire burning in the distance would have lit up
the landscape: groups of people were lying here and there, scattered
beneath the pine trees; cars stood motionless; next to the young
woman and the man in the cap lay the open basket of food, half
empty, and the gold foil from an uncorked bottle of champagne.
“You shouldn’t have, Jules. I don’t like it, it’s upsetting to have to
do a thing like that.”<br><br>

The man was small and scrawny, with a big forehead and enormous
eyes, a weak mouth and a little weasely chin. “What do you
want?” he protested. “You want us to starve to death?”<br><br>

“Leave him alone, Aline, he’s right, for goodness sake!” said the
woman with the bandaged head. “What do you want us to do? Those
two, they don’t deserve to live, they don’t, I’m telling you!”<br><br>

They stopped talking. She had been a servant until she’d married a
worker from the Renault car factory. They’d managed to keep him
in Paris during the first few months of the war, but he’d gone in
February and now he was fighting God knows where. He’d already
fought in the other war and he was the oldest of four children, but
none of that had made any difference. Privileges, exemptions, connections,
all that was for the middle classes. Deep in her heart were
layer upon layer of hatred, overlapping yet distinct: the countrywoman’s
hatred, who instinctively detests city people, the servant’s
hatred, weary and bitter at having lived in other people’s houses, the 
<b>[p.72]</b> worker’s hatred. For the past few months she had replaced her husband
at the factory. She couldn’t get used to doing a man’s work; it
had strengthened her arms but hardened her soul.<br><br>

“You really got them, Jules,” she said to her brother. “I’m telling
you, I didn’t think you had it in you!”<br><br>

“When I saw Aline about to faint, and those bastards with all their
wine, foie gras and everything, I don’t know what came over me.”<br><br>

Aline, who seemed shyer and softer, ventured, “We could have
just asked them for some, don’t you think, Hortense?”<br><br>

“What, are you crazy?” her husband exclaimed. “For goodness
sake! No, you don’t know their type. They’d rather see us die like
dogs, worse! You’re crazy...”.<br><br>

“I know those two, I do,” said Hortense. “They’re the worst, they
are. I saw him once at that old bag the Countess Barral du Jeu’s; he
writes books and plays. A madman, according to the driver, and thick
as two short planks.”<br><br>

Hortense put away the rest of the food as she spoke. Her large red
hands were extraordinarily nimble and agile. Then she picked up the
baby and undressed him. “Poor little thing, what a journey! Oh, he’ll
have learned about life early, he will. Maybe that’s better. Sometimes
I don’t regret having had a hard life: knowing how to use your hands,
there are some who can’t even say that. You remember, Jules, when
Ma died, I was just about thirteen. I went to the wash-house no matter
what the weather, breaking the ice in winter and carrying bundles
of laundry on my back ... I used to cry into my raw hands. But then,
that taught me to stand on my own two feet and not to be afraid.”<br><br>

“You really can cope, for sure,” said Aline with admiration.<br><br>

Once the baby was changed, washed and dried, Aline unbuttoned
her blouse and held her little one to her breast; the others watched
her, smiling.<br><br>

“At least he’ll have something to eat, poor little chap, won’t he!”<br><br>

The champagne was going to their heads; they felt vaguely,
sweetly intoxicated. They watched the flames in the distance in a deep
stupor. Now and again they would forget why they were in this
strange place, why they had left their little flat near the Gare de Lyon,
rushed along the roads, crossed the forest at Fontainebleau, robbed
Corte. Everything was becoming dark and cloudy, as in a dream. 
<b>[p.73]</b> They’d hung the cage from a low branch and now they fed the birds.
Hortense had remembered to bring a packet of seeds for them when
they left. She took a few pieces of sugar from her pocket and put
them into a cup of boiling hot coffee: the thermos had survived the
car accident. She drank it noisily, bringing her thick lips to the
cup, one hand placed on her enormous bosom to protect it from coffee
stains. Suddenly, a rumour spread from group to group: “The
Germans marched into Paris this morning.”<br><br>

Hortense dropped her half-full cup; her round face had gone even
redder. She bowed her head and began crying. “Now that hurts ...
that hurts here,” she said, touching her heart.<br><br>

A few hot tears ran down her face, the tears of a hard woman who
seldom pities either herself or anyone else. A feeling of anger, sadness
and shame swept through her, so violently that she felt a physical
pain, piercing and sharp, near her heart. Finally she said, “You know
I love my husband ... Poor Louis, it’s just the two of us and he
works, doesn’t drink, doesn’t fool around, you know, we love each
other, he’s all I’ve got, but even if they told me, ‘You’ll never see him
again, he’s just died, but we won .. .’ well, I’d rather have that, oh,
I’m telling you, I’m not kidding, I’d rather have that!”<br><br>

“I know,” said Aline, trying in vain to find better words, “I know,
it’s upsetting.”<br><br>

Jules said nothing, thinking of his partially paralysed arm, which
had allowed him to escape military service and the war. “I’ve been
very lucky,” he said to himself, but at the same time there was something
upsetting him, he didn’t know what, maybe remorse. “Well,
that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is, nothing we can do about it,” he
said gloomily.<br><br>

They started talking about Corte again. They thought with pleasure
of the excellent dinner they had eaten instead of him. All the
same, they now judged him less harshly. Hortense, who at the
Countess Barral du Jeu’s house had seen writers, academics and even,
one day, the Countess de Noailles, made them laugh till they cried
with her stories about them.<br><br>

“It’s not that they’re so bad,” said Aline. “They just don’t know
about life.”<br><br>

<b>[p.74]</b><br><br>

<h2>16</h2><br><br>

The Péricands couldn’t get lodgings in the town, but they did find a
large room in a neighbouring village, in a house inhabited by two elderly
spinsters which was opposite the church. The children were put
to bed still in their clothes, utterly exhausted. Jacqueline asked in a
tearful voice if she could have the cat’s basket next to her. She was
obsessed by the idea he might escape, that he would be lost, forgotten,
and would die of hunger on the road. She put her hand through
the basket’s wicker bars, which made a kind of window for the cat allowing
a glimpse of a blazing green eye and long whiskers bristling
with anger. Only then did she calm down. Emmanuel was frightened
by this strange, enormous room and the two old ladies running about
like headless chickens. “Have you ever seen anything like it?” they
groaned. “How could you not feel sorry for them ... poor unfortunate
dears ... dear Jesus...” Bernard lay there watching them without
batting an eye, a dazed, serious expression on his face as he
sucked on a piece of sugar he’d kept hidden in his pocket for three
days; the heat had melted it, so it was lumped together with a bit of
lead from a pencil, a faded stamp and a piece of string. The other bed
in the room was occupied by the elder Monsieur Péricand. Madame
Péricand, Hubert and the servants would spend the night on chairs in
the dining room.<br><br>

Through the open windows you could see a little garden in the
moonlight. A brilliant peaceful light glistened on the clusters of
sweet-scented white lilacs and on the path’s silvery stones where a cat
stepped softly. The dining room was crowded with refugees and villagers
listening to the radio together. The women were crying. The
men, silent, lowered their heads. It wasn’t exactly despair they were
feeling; it was more like a refusal to understand, the stupor you feel 
<b>[p.75]</b> when you’re dreaming, when the veil of sleep is about to lift, when
you can feel the dawn light, when your whole body reaches out
towards it, when you think, “It was just a nightmare, I’m going to
wake up now.” They stood there, motionless, avoiding each other’s
eyes. When Hubert switched off the radio, the men left without saying
a word. Only the group of women remained in the room. You
could hear them sighing, lamenting the misfortunes of their country,
which, for them, bore the features of cherished husbands and sons still
at the front. Their pain was more physical than the men’s, simpler as
well and more open. They consoled themselves with recriminations:
“Well ... I don’t know why we bothered! ... To end up here ... It’s
shameful, it is ... we’ve been betrayed, Madame, betrayed I say .. .
we’ve been sold out and now it’s the poor men who are suffering...”<br><br>

Hubert listened to them, clenching his fists, rage in his heart. What
was he doing here? Bunch of old chatterboxes, he thought. If only he
were two years older! Suddenly his young and innocent mind--younger,
until now, than his years--was overtaken by the passions
and torment of a grown man: patriotic anguish, a burning feeling of
shame, pain, anger and the desire to make a sacrifice. Finally, and for
the first time in his life, he thought, he felt linked to a truly serious
cause. It wasn’t enough to cry or shout traitor, he was a man; he
might not be legally old enough to fight but he knew he was stronger,
more robust, more able, more cunning than these old men of thirty-five
and forty who had been sent to war, and he was free. He wasn’t
held back by family ties, by love! “Oh, I want to go,” he murmured,
“I want to go!”<br><br>

He rushed towards his mother, grabbed her hand, took her aside.
“Mummy, let me have some food and my red jumper from your bag
and ... give me a kiss,” he said. “I’m leaving.” He couldn’t breathe.
Tears were streaming down his face.<br><br>

His mother looked at him and understood. “Come on now, darling,
you’re mad...”<br><br>

“Mother, I’m leaving. I can’t stay here ... I’ll die, I’ll kill myself if
I have to stay here and be useless, twiddling my thumbs while ... and
don’t you realise the Germans will come and force all the boys to
fight, make them fight for them. I couldn’t! Let me go.” 
<b>[p.76]</b> He had gradually raised his voice and was shouting now; he
couldn’t control himself. He was surrounded by a circle of trembling,
terrified old women: another young boy, scarcely older than him, the
nephew of the two spinsters, rosy and fair, with curly hair and big innocent
blue eyes, had joined him and repeated in a slight southern accent
(his parents were civil servants-he’d been born in Tarascon),
“Of course we have to go, and tonight! Look, not very far from here,
in the Sainte woods, there are troops . . . all we have to do is get on
our bikes and join them...”<br><br>

“Rene,” moaned his aunts, holding on to him, “Rene, my darling,
think of your mother!”<br><br>

“Let go of me, Auntie, this is not a matter for women,” he replied,
pushing them away, and his lovely face flushed with pleasure: he was
proud of what he’d said.<br><br>

He looked at Hubert, who had dried his tears and was standing
next to the window, serious and determined. He went up to him and
whispered in his ear, “Are we going, then?”<br><br>

“Yes, we’re going,” Hubert whispered back. He thought for a
minute and added, “Meet on the road leading out of the village, at
midnight.”<br><br>

They shook hands in secret. Around them the women were all
talking at once, begging them to gtve up their plan, to take pity on
their parents, to hold on to their lives, such precious lives, to think of
the future. At that moment they heard Jacqueline’s piercing screams
from upstairs. “Mummy, Mummy, come quickly! Albert’s run away!”<br><br>

“Albert, is that your other son? Oh, my God!” exclaimed the
spinsters.<br><br>

“No, no, Albert’s the cat,” said Madame Péricand, who thought
she was going mad.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the sound of deep muffled explosions reverberated
through the air: guns were firing in the distance, they were surrounded
by danger. Madame Péricand collapsed into a chair. “Hubert,
just listen to me! In the absence of your father I am in charge. You
are a child, barely seventeen, your duty is to save yourself for the
future...”<br><br>

“For the next war?”<br><br>

<b>[p.77]</b><br><br>

“For the next war,” Madame Péricand repeated automatically. “In
the meantime, you must simply be quiet and do as I say. You are not
going anywhere! If you had any feelings at all such a cruel, stupid
idea would not even have crossed your mind! Don’t you think I’m
miserable enough? Don’t you realise we’ve lost? That the Germans
are coming and you’d be killed or taken prisoner before going a hundred
metres? No! Not a word! I’m not even going to discuss it; you’ll
leave here over my dead body!”<br><br>

“Mummy, Mummy,” Jacqueline kept shouting. “I want Albert!
Find Albert for me! The Germans will take him! He ‘11 be bombed,
stolen, killed! Albert! Albert! Albert!”<br><br>

“Jacqueline, be quiet, you’ll wake up your brothers!”<br><br>

Everyone was shouting at once. Hubert, lips trembling, broke
away from the frenzied group of gesticulating old women. Did they
understand nothing at all? Life was like Shakespeare, noble and
tragic, and they wanted to debase it. The world was crumbling, was
nothing more than rubble and ruins, yet they remained the same.
Women were inferior creatures; they didn’t know the meaning of
heroism, glory, faith, the spirit of sacrifice. All they did was to bring
everything they touched down to their level. God! Just to see a man,
to shake the hand of a man! Even father, he thought, but most of all
his beloved brother, the good, the great Philippe. He longed for his
brother so much that, once again, tears came to his eyes. The incessant
noise of gunfire filled him with anxiety and excitement; he
started trembling all over, shaking his head from side to side like a
frightened horse. But he wasn’t afraid. Not at all! He wasn’t afraid!
He welcomed, he embraced, the idea of death. It would be a beautiful 1
death for this lost cause. It would be better than crouching in trenches
as they did in ‘14. Now they fought in the open air, beneath the beautiful
June sun or in the brilliant moonlight.<br><br>

His mother had gone upstairs to Jacqueline, but she’d taken precautions:
when he tried to get into the garden he found the door
locked. He banged on it, shook it.<br><br>

“Leave the door alone, Monsieur!” protested the two old ladies
who were already in bed. “It’s late. We’re tired, we want to go to
sleep. Let us sleep.”<br><br>

<b>[p.78]</b><br><br>

“Go to bed, my little one,” one of them said.<br><br>

Angrily he shrugged his shoulders. “<i>My little one</i> ... old hag!”<br><br>

His mother came back downstairs. “Jacqueline was hysterical,”
she said. “Fortunately I had a flask of orange flower water in my bag.
Don’t bite your nails. Hubert, you’re getting on my nerves. Come on,
settle down in this armchair and go to sleep.”<br><br>

“I’m not tired.”<br><br>

“I don’t care, go to sleep,” she said in a strict, impatient tone of
voice, as if she were talking to Emmanuel.<br><br>

His soul full of indignation, he flung himself into an old cretonne
armchair, which creaked under his weight.<br><br>

Madame Péricand raised her eyes to heaven. “You are so clumsy,
darling. You’ll break the seat. Do stay still.”<br><br>

“Yes, Mother,” he said submissively.<br><br>

“Did you remember to get your raincoat from the car?”<br><br>

“No, Mother.”<br><br>

“You never remember anything!”<br><br>

“But I won’t need it. It’s nice out.”<br><br>

“It could rain tomorrow.”<br><br>

She took her knitting out of her bag. Her needles clicked. When
Hubert was little, she would sit near him knitting during his piano
lessons. He closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. A while later
she nodded off. He jumped out of the open window, ran to the shed
where his bicycle had been put away and, silently opening the gate,
slipped away. Everyone was asleep now. The gunfire had stopped.
Cats wailed from the rooftops. A splendid church, with sky-blue windows,
rose up in the middle of a dusty old avenue where refugees had
parked. The people who hadn’t been able to find accommodation
were sleeping inside their cars or on the grass. Anguish oozed from
their pale faces, tense and fearful, even in their sleep. They slept so
soundly, though, nothing would wake them before daybreak. That
was obvious. They could pass from sleep to death without even
realising it.<br><br>

Hubert walked among them feeling shock and pity. He wasn’t
tired. His overexcited state of mind gave him strength and kept him
going. He thought with sadness and remorse of the family he had 
<b>[p.79]</b> abandoned. But this very sadness and remorse increased his elation.
He wasn’t going into it with his eyes closed; he was sacrificing not
just his own life, but the life of everyone in his family to his country.
He marched towards his destiny like a young god bearing offerings.
At least, that was how he saw himself. He left the village, got to the
cherry tree and threw himself to the ground beneath its branches. A
lovely sweet feeling suddenly made his heart beat faster: he thought
of the new friend who would share his dangerous exploits and glory.
He barely knew him, the boy with the blond hair, but he felt bound to
him with extraordinary violence and tenderness. He had heard that,
while crossing a bridge in the north, a German regiment had had to
walk over the bodies of their dead comrades and that they had started
singing: “Once I had a comrade...” He understood that feeling of
pure, almost savage love. Unconsciously, he was trying to replace
Philippe, whom he loved so much and who had separated himself
from his younger brother with such implacable gentleness; Philippe
was too strict, too saintly, Hubert thought, and with no feelings, no
passion for anyone but Christ.<br><br>

For the past two years Hubert had felt very lonely and, at school,
had almost made a point of befriending only bullies or snobs. Also,
he was attracted, almost without realising it, to physical beauty—and
Ren had the face of an angel. He waited for him, starting at every
sound. It was nearly midnight. A horse went by without a rider.
Strange sights like this occasionally reminded him of the war, but
otherwise everything was quiet. He pulled a long weed out of the
ground and chewed it, then examined the contents of one of his
pockets: a bit of bread, an apple, some nuts, gingerbread crumbs, a
pocket knife, a ball of string, his little red notebook. On the first page
he wrote: “If I am killed, could you please notify my father, Monsieur
Péricand, 18 Boulevard Delessert in Paris, or my mother...” He
added the address in Nîmes. He remembered he hadn’t said his
prayers that night. He knelt down in the grass and prayed, adding a
special Creed for his family. He felt at peace with man and God.
While he was praying, the bells sounded midnight. Now he had to be
ready to go.<br><br>

The moon lit up the road. It was empty. He waited patiently for 
<b>[p.80]</b> half an hour, then became overwhelmed with anxiety. Hiding his
bicycle in the ditch, he walked towards the village hoping to meet
Rene, but there was no sign of him. Back under the cherry tree, he
waited some more, examining the contents of his other pocket: some
crumpled-up cigarettes, a bit of money. He smoked a cigarette
without pleasure. He still wasn’t used to the taste of tobacco. His
hands were shaking nervously. He pulled flowers out of the ground
and flicked them away. It was past one o’clock. Was it possible that
René ... ? No, no ... you don’t break a promise like that ... He’d
been prevented from coming, locked in by his aunts perhaps, but he,
Hubert, hadn’t let his mother’s precautions prevent him from getting
away. Mother. She would soon wake up and then what would she do?
They would look everywhere for him. He couldn’t stay here, so close
to the village. But what if René came? ... He would wait for him
until daybreak, then leave.<br><br>

The first rays of sun were beginning to light up the road when
Hubert finally set off. Pushing his bicycle, he cautiously climbed
the hill to the Sainte woods, preparing what he would say to the soldiers.
He heard voices, laughter, a horse neighing. Someone shouted.
Hubert stopped, out of breath: they were speaking German. He
jumped behind a tree, saw a greenish uniform a few feet away and,
abandoning his bicycle, shot off like a hare. At the bottom of the hill
he took the wrong path, kept on running and reached the village, but
didn’t recognise it. Then he went down to the main road and ended
up in the middle of all the refugees’ cars. They were driving insanely
fast, insanely. He saw one (a big grey open touring car) that had just
knocked a small van into the ditch and driven off without slowing
down even for a moment. The further he walked, the faster the flood
of cars was moving, like in some mad film, he thought. He saw a
truck full of soldiers. He waved at them desperately. Without stopping,
someone stretched out his hand and hoisted him up amid the
camouflaged guns and boxes of tarpaulins.<br><br>

“I wanted to warn you,” said Hubert, panting. “I saw Germans in
the woods nearby.”<br><br>

“They’re everywhere, my boy,” the soldier replied.<br><br>

“Can I go with you?” Hubert asked shyly. “I want...” (his voice
breaking with emotion), “I want to fight.”<br><br>

<b>[p.81]</b><br><br>

The soldier looked at him and remained silent. Nothing these men
heard or saw seemed to be able to surprise or move them any more.
Hubert learned that they had picked up a pregnant woman along the
way, as well as a child wounded in the bombing who’d been either
abandoned or lost and a dog with a broken leg. He also learned they
intended to hold the enemy back and prevent them, if possible, from
crossing the bridge.<br><br>

“I’m with them,” Hubert thought. “That’s it, I’m in it now.”<br><br>

The surging wave of refugees surrounded the truck, preventing
them from moving forward. Sometimes it was impossible for the soldiers
to move at all. They would fold their arms and wait until someone
let them pass. Hubert was sitting at the back of the truck, his legs
dangling outside. He was filled with an extraordinary sense of turmoil,
a confusion of ideas and emotions, but what he felt most was
utter scorn for humanity as a whole. The feeling was almost physical.
A few months earlier, his friends had given him some drink for the
first time in his life. He thought of the taste now: the horrible taste of
bitter ashes that bad wine leaves in your mouth. He had been such a
good little boy. He had seen the world as simple and beautiful, men as
worthy of respect. Men ... a herd of cowardly wild animals. That
René who had urged him to run off, and then stayed tucked up under
his quilt, while France was dying ... Those people who refused to
give the refugees a bed, a glass of water, who charged a fortune for an
egg, who stuffed their cars full of luggage, packages, food, even furniture,
but who told a woman dying of exhaustion, children who had
walked from Paris, “You can’t come with us ... you can see very well
there’s no room...”Leather suitcases and painted women in a truck
full of officers: such egotism, cowardice, such vicious, useless cruelty
made him sick.<br><br>

And the most horrible thing was that he couldn’t ignore the sacrifices,
the heroism, the kindness of some. Philippe, for example, was a
saint; these soldiers who’d had nothing to eat or drink (the supply officer
had left that morning but hadn’t returned in time) going to do
battle for a hopeless cause, they were heroes. There was courage,
self-sacrifice, love among these men, but that was frightening too:
even goodness was predestined, according to Philippe. Whenever
Philippe spoke, he seemed both enlightened and passionate at the 
<b>[p.82]</b> same time, as if lit up by a very pure flame: But Hubert had serious
doubts about religion and Philippe was far away. The outside world
was incoherent and hideous, painted in the colours of hell, a hell
Jesus never could enter, Hubert thought, “because they would tear
him to pieces.”<br><br>

Machine-guns fired on the convoy. Death was gliding across the
sky and suddenly plunged down from the heavens, wings outstretched,
steel beak firing on this long line of trembling black insects
crawling along the road. Everyone threw themselves to the ground;
women lay on top of their children to protect them. When the firing
stopped, deep furrows were left in the crowd, like wheat after a storm
when the fallen stems form close, deep trenches. Only when it had
been quiet for a few moments could you hear the cries and moans:
people calling to one another, moans that went ignored, cries shouted
out in vain ...<br><br>

The refugees got back into the cars they’d left beside the road and
started off again, but some of the cars remained abandoned, their
doors open, baggage still tied to the roof, a wheel in the ditch where
the driver had rushed to take shelter. He would never return. In the
cars, amid the abandoned packages, there was sometimes a dog howling,
pulling on his lead, or a cat rniaowing frantically, locked in its
basket.<br><br>

<b>[p.83]</b><br><br>

<h2>17</h2><br><br>

The instincts of a former age were still at work in Gabriel Corte:
when someone hurt him, rather than defend himself, his first reaction
was to complain. Dragging Florence behind him, he strode impatiently
through Paray-le-Moniallooking for the mayor, the police, a
councillor, a deputy, any government official at all who could get him
back his dinner. But it was extraordinary ... the streets were empty,
the houses silent. At a crossroads he carne across a small group of
women who seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.<br><br>

“We have no idea, we don’t come from here,” they replied to his
questions. “We’re refugees, like you,” one of them added.<br><br>

They could smell smoke, very faintly, carried by the soft June
wind.<br><br>

After a while he began to wonder where their car was. Florence
thought they’d left it near the railway station. Gabriel remembered
seeing a bridge they could look for; the moon, magnificent and
peaceful, lit their way, but all the streets in this small old town looked
the same. Everywhere there were gables, ancient stone walls, lopsided
balconies, dark cul-de-sacs.<br><br>

“Like a bad opera set,” Corte groaned.<br><br>

It even smelled of backstage: sad and dusty, with the faint lingering
odour of urine. Sweat was running down his face in the heat. He
could hear Florence calling from behind, “Wait for me! Will you stop
a minute, you coward, you bastard! Where are you, Gabriel? Where
are you? Gabriel, I can’t see you. You pig!” Her cries of rage rebounded
off the old walls and their echo struck him like bullets: “Pig,
you old bastard, coward!”<br><br>

She finally caught up with him near the railway station. She leapt
at him, hitting, scratching, spitting in his face while he shrieked and 
<b>[p.84]</b> tried to fight her off. No one could ever have imagined that the
low, weary voice of Gabriel Corte concealed such resonant, shrill
sounds, so feminine and wild. They were both being driven mad by
hunger, fear and exhaustion.<br><br>

As soon as they saw that the Avenue de la Gare was deserted, they
realised the order had been given to evacuate the town. Everyone else
was far away, on the moonlit bridge. Only a few exhausted soldiers
remained, sitting on the pavement in small groups. One of them, a
very young pale boy with thick .glasses, hauled himself up to separate
Florence and Corte.<br><br>

“Come on, Monsieur ... Now, now, Madame, you should be
ashamed of yourselves!”<br><br>

“But where are the cars?” Corte shouted.<br><br>


“Gone. They were ordered to leave.”<br><br>

“But, but ... by whom? Why? What about our luggage? My
manuscripts! I am Gabriel Corte!”<br><br>

“Good God, you’ll find your manuscripts. And I can tell you that
other people have lost a lot more.”<br><br>

“Philistine!”<br><br>

“Of course, Monsieur, but...”<br><br>

“Who gave this stupid order?”<br><br>

“Well, Monsieur ... there have been a lot of orders which were
just as stupid, I’ll admit. Don’t worry, you’ll find your car and your
papers. But in the meantime, you can’t stay here. The Germans will
be here any minute. We’ve been ordered to blow up the station.”<br><br>

“Where will we go?” Florence groaned.<br><br>

“Go back to the town.”<br><br>

“But where can we stay?”<br><br>

“There are plenty of rooms. Everyone’s run off,” said one of the
soldiers who had come up to them and was standing a few steps away
from Corte.<br><br>

The moon gave off a soft blue light. The man had a harsh, heavy
face; two vertical lines cut down his thick cheeks. He put his hand on
Gabriel’s shoulder and effortlessly spun him round. “Off you go.
We’ve had enough of you, got it?”<br><br>

For a second Gabriel thought he might jump at the soldier, but the
<b>[p.85]</b> pressure of that hard hand on his shoulder made him flinch and take
two steps backwards. “We’ve been on the road since Monday ... and
we’re hungry...”<br><br>

“We’re hungry,” Florence echoed, sighing.<br><br>

“Wait until morning. If we’re still here we’ll give you some
soup.”<br><br>

The soldier with the thick glasses said again in his soft, weary
voice, “You can’t stay here, Monsieur ... Go on, off you go.” He
took Corte by the hand and gave him a little push, just as you would
send the children out of the drawing room when it was time for bed.<br><br>

They went back across the town square, side by side now and
dragging their weary legs; their anger had subsided and with it the
nervous energy that had kept them going. They were so demoralised
that they didn’t have the strength to start looking for another restaurant.
They knocked at doors that never opened and eventually collapsed
on a bench near a church. Florence, wincing with pain, took
off her shoes.<br><br>

Night passed. Nothing happened. The railway station was still
standing. Now and again, they could hear soldiers walking in the
streets nearby. Some men passed by the bench once or twice without
even glancing at Florence and Corte, huddled together in the silent
shadows, leaning their heavy heads together. They could smell the
stench of meat: a bomb had hit the abattoir on the outskirts of the
town and it was on fire. They dozed off. When they woke up, they
saw soldiers going by with tin dishes. Florence cried out in hunger
and the soldiers gave her a bowl of soup and a bit of bread. Daylight
returned and with it Gabriel recovered some dignity: he wouldn’t
dream of fighting with his mistress over some soup and a crust of
bread!<br><br>

Florence drank slowly. Then she stopped and walked towards
Gabriel. “You have the rest,” she said to her lover.<br><br>

“No, no, there’s barely enough for you,” he protested. She handed
him the tin bowl of warm liquid that smelled of cabbage. Trembling,
he gripped it with both hands and, placing his mouth at the edge of
the bowl, wolfed it down in big gulps, barely stopping to catch his
breath. When he had finished, he gave a happy sigh.<br><br>

<b>[p.86]</b><br><br>

“Better?” a soldier asked.<br><br>

They recognised the man who’d chased them away from the railway
station the night before, but the dawn light softened his fierce
centurion’s face. Gabriel remembered he had some cigarettes in his
pocket and offered them to him. The two men smoked for a while
without speaking, while Florence tried in vain to get her shoes
back on.<br><br>

“If I were you,” the soldier finally said, “I’d hurry up and get out
of here ‘cause the Germans are definitely going to show up. It’s a
miracle they aren’t here yet. Still, they don’t have to hurry,” he added
bitterly, “they’ve got it sewn up from here to Bayonne...”<br><br>

“Do you think we have any chance?” Florence asked shyly.<br><br>

The soldier didn’t answer and suddenly left. They left too, hobbling
along, heading straight for the outskirts. Gradually, refugees
began to emerge from the seemingly deserted town, weighed down
with baggage. In the same way that animals separated in a storm find
their herd when the storm has passed, they came together in small
groups and walked towards the bridge; it was guarded by soldiers
who let them pass. Gabriel and Florence followed. Above, the sky
shimmered a pure azure blue: no clouds, no planes. Below, a beautiful
glistening river flowed by. In front of them, they could see the road
leading south and some very young trees with new green leaves.
Suddenly the trees seemed to be moving towards them. German
trucks and guns, covered with camouflage, were heading straight at
them. Corte saw people ahead raising their arms and running back.
At that moment the French soldiers opened fire. When the German
machine-guns fired back, the refugees were caught in the crossfire.
They ran in all directions. Some simply whirled round on the spot as
if they’d gone mad; one woman climbed over the parapet and threw
herself into the river.<br><br>

Florence dug her nails into Corte’s arm and screamed, “Turn
back, hurry!”<br><br>

“But they’ll blow up the bridge,” Corte shouted.<br><br>

Taking her hand, he propelled her forward and suddenly a
thought shot through him, as strange, burning and sharp as lightning:
they were running towards death. He pulled her close and, pushing 
<b>[p.87]</b> her head down, covered it with his coat as you cover the eyes of a
condemned man. Then, stumbling, panting, half carrying her, he ran
the short distance to the other side of the river. Even though his heart
was pounding in his chest, he wasn’t actually afraid. He had a passionate,
urgent desire to save Florence. He had faith in something
invisible, in a guiding hand reaching out to him, to him, weak, miserable,
insignificant, so insignificant that destiny would spare him, as
a wisp of straw sometimes survives a storm. They made it across
the bridge, narrowly missing the advancing Germans with their
machine-guns and green uniforms. The road was clear, death was behind
them and suddenly they saw it—yes, they were right, they
recognised it—right there, at the edge of a little country lane, their
car and their loyal servants waiting for them. Florence could only
groan, “Julie, thank God. Julie!”<br><br>

To Corte, the voices of the driver and maid sounded like the low,
strange noises you hear through a fog just before you faint. Florence
was crying. Slowly, incredulously, painfully, Corte realised that he
had his car back, his manuscripts back, his life back. He would no
longer be an ordinary man, suffering, starving, both courageous and
cowardly at the same time, but instead a privileged creature, protected
from all evil. He would be-Gabriel Corte!<br><br>

<b>[p.88]</b><br><br>

<h2>18</h2><br><br>

At last Hubert arrived at the Allier river with the men he’d met on the
road. It was noon on Monday, 17 June. Volunteers had joined the soldiers
along the way. There were policemen, members of the home
guard, a few Senegalese, and soldiers whose defeated companie~
were trying in vain to regroup and who clung on to any little island of
resistance with hopeless courage. There were also young boys like
Hubert Péricand who’d become separated from their fleeing families
or run away in the night “to join the troops.” These magical words
had spread from village to village, from one farm to the next. “We’re
going to join the troops, dodge the Germans, regroup by the Loire,”
said hordes of sixteen-year-olds. These children carried sacks over
their shoulders (the remainder of yesterday’s afternoon tea hastily
wrapped up in a shirt and jumper by a tearful mother); their faces
were round and rosy, their fingers stained with ink, their voices
breaking. Three of them were accompanied by their fathers, veterans
of ‘14, whose age, former injuries and family situation had prevented
them from joining up in September.<br><br>

At the bottom of the steps that led down from a stone bridge sat
the Commander in Chief of the battalion. Hubert counted nearly 200
men on the road and river bank. In his nai”vety he believed that this
powerful army would now confront the enemy. He saw explosives
stacked up on the stone bridge; what he didn’t know was that there
was no fuse to light them. Silently the soldiers went about their business
or slept on the ground. They hadn’t eaten anything since the day
before. Towards evening, bottles of beer were handed out. Hubert
wasn’t hungry but the frothy, bitter beer made him feel happy. It
helped him to keep up his courage. No one actually seemed to need
him. He went from one person to the other, shyly offering to help; no 
<b>[p.89]</b> one answered him, no one even looked at him. He saw two soldiers
dragging some straw and bundles of firewood to the bridge; another
was pushing a barrel of tar. Hubert grabbed an enormous bundle of
wood but so clumsily that splinters ripped his hands and he let out a
little cry of pain. Throwing it on to the bridge, he heaved a sigh of
relief that no one appeared to have noticed, only to hear one of the
men call out, “What the hell are you doing here? Can’t you see you’re
just in the way?”<br><br>

Wounded to the core, Hubert moved aside. He stood motionless
on the road to Saint-Pourçain, facing the river, and watched the incomprehensible
actions of the soldiers: the straw and the wood had
been doused in tar and placed on the bridge next to a fifty-litre drum
of petrol; by using a seventy-five-millimetre gun to detonate the explosives,
they were counting on this barricade to hold back the enemy
troops.<br><br>

And so the rest of the day went by, then the night and the entire
next morning. The hours of boredom felt strange and incoherent,
like a fever. Still nothing to eat, nothing to drink. Even the young
boys from the countryside lost their fresh complexions. Pale with
hunger, blackened by dust, hair dishevelled, eyes burning, a sad and
stubborn expression on their faces, they seemed suddenly older.<br><br>

It was two o’clock when the first Germans came into sight on
the other side of the river. Their motor convoy had come through
Paray-le-Monial that very morning. Dumbfounded, Hubert watched
them head towards the bridge at incredible speed, like a wild, warlike
streak of lightning searing through the peaceful countryside. It only
lasted a second: a gunshot set off the barrels of explosive forming the
barricade. Debris from the bridge, the vehicles and their drivers all
fell into the river. Hubert saw soldiers running ahead.<br><br>

“This is it! We’re attacking,” he thought. He got goose bumps and
his throat went dry, like when he was a child and heard the first strains
of military music in the street. He hurled himself towards the straw
and wood barricade just as it was being set on fire. The black smoke
from the tar filled his nose and mouth. Behind this protective wall,
machine-guns were holding back the German tanks. Choking, coughing,
sneezing, Hubert crawled a few steps backwards. He was in <b>[p.90]</b> 
despair. He had no weapon. All he could do was stand there. They were
fighting and he just stood there, arms folded, inert, useless. He felt a
little better when he saw that all around him they were taking the
enemy’s attack without fighting back. He considered this a complex
tactical manoeuvre until he realised that the men had almost no ammunition.
“Nevertheless,” he thought, “if we’ve been left here it’s
because we’re needed, we’re useful, we’re defending the bulk of the
French army, for all we know.” At every moment he expected to see
more troops appearing on the road to Saint-Pourçain. “We’re here,
lads,” they’d shout, “don’t worry! We’ll beat them!” — or some other
warlike cry. But no one came.<br><br>

Near by he saw a man, his head covered in blood, stumble like a
drunkard into a thicket; he sat there between the branches in a bizarre
and uncomfortable position, his knees folded under him, his chin
resting on his chest. He heard an officer shouting angrily, “No doctors,
no nurses, no ambulances! What are we supposed to do?”<br><br>

“There’s a beat-up ambulance in the garden of the toll-house,”
someone replied.<br><br>

“What am I supposed to do with that, for God’s sake?” the officer
repeated. “Forget it.”<br><br>

The shells had set fire to a part of the town. In the splendid June
light, the flames took on a transparent pink colour; a plume of smoke
drifted up to the sky, flecked with gold by the sunlight, tinged with
sulphur and ash.<br><br>

“Well, they’re off,” a soldier said to Hubert, pointing to the
machine-gunners who were abandoning their post on the bridge.<br><br>

“But why?” Hubert shouted, dismayed. “Aren’t they going to
keep fighting?”<br><br>

“With what?”<br><br>

This is a disaster, thought Hubert with a sigh. This is defeat! I am
here, watching an enormous defeat, worse than Waterloo. We are all
lost. I’ll never see Mother or any of my family again. I’m going to
die. He felt doomed, numb to everything around him, in a terrible
state of exhaustion and despair. He didn’t hear the order to retreat.
He saw men running through the machine-gun fire. Rushing forward,
he climbed over a wall into a garden where a baby’s pram still <b>[p.91]</b> 
stood in the shade. The battle wasn’t over. Without tanks, without
weapons, without ammunition, they were still trying to defend a few
square metres of ground, a bridgehead, while from all directions the
German conquerors were sweeping through France.<br><br>

Hubert was suddenly gripped by a feeling of hopeless courage, almost
madness. He realised that he was running away when his duty
was to go back towards the fighting, towards the automatic rifles he
could still hear obstinately returning the German fire, to die with
them. Once again, risking his life at every moment, he crossed the
small garden, trampling on children’s toys. Where were the people
who lived in this little house? Had they fled? He climbed over the
wire fence under a hail of bullets and, still alive, fell back on to the
road and began crawling towards the river again, his hands and knees
bleeding. He would never make it, never. He was halfway there when
everything fell silent. He realised that it was night and that he must
have fainted from exhaustion. The extraordinary sudden silence had
brought him round. He sat up. His mind was blank and his head
throbbed. A magnificent moon lit up the road, but he was sitting in a
line of shade cast by a tree trunk. Villars was still burning; all the
guns were silent.<br><br>

Afraid he might encounter more Germans, Hubert left the road
and entered a small wood. Now and again he stopped, wondering
where he was. There was no doubt whatsoever that the motor convoys
that had taken only five days to invade half of France would
reach the borders of Italy, Switzerland, Spain by tomorrow. He
wouldn’t be able to escape them. He had forgotten that he wasn’t
wearing a uniform, that nothing showed he’d been fighting. He was
sure he’d be taken prisoner. He kept running, following the same instincts
that had taken him to the battleground and that now led him
far from the fires, the destroyed bridges, the dreams in which, for the
first time in his life, he had come face to face with death. He spent the
night frantically trying to work out which route the Germans might
take. He could picture the towns falling, one after the other, the defeated
soldiers, the discarded weapons, the trucks abandoned on the
road for lack of petrol, the tanks, the big guns (whose toy models he
had so admired) and all the treasure fallen into enemy hands! He was <b>[p.92]</b> 
shaking, crying as he crawled on his hands and knees through the
moonlit fields, but still he wouldn’t believe they’d been defeated: a
healthy young boy always refuses to believe in death. The soldiers
would meet up again a bit further away, they’d regroup, do battle
once more and he’d be with them. And he’d be ... with them ...<br><br>

But what have <i>I</i> done? he thought all of a sudden. I haven’t fired a
single shot! He felt so ashamed of himself that he started crying
again, bitter, painful tears. “It’s not my fault, I didn’t have any
weapons, just my own two hands.” Suddenly he pictured himself trying
in vain to drag the bundle of wood to the river. No, he hadn’t
even been able to do that, he who’d wanted to rush the bridge, lead
the soldiers, throw himself on the enemy tanks and die shouting
“<i>Vive la France!</i>” He was wild with exhaustion and despair, yet nevertheless
some oddly mature ideas passed through his mind: he
thought about the disaster, what had caused it, the future, death.
Then he wondered about himself, what would become of him and,
little by little, he came back to reality. “Mother is going to be furious!”
he muttered and his pale, tense face, which seemed to have aged
and grown thin in only two days, lit up for a second as he grinned in
an innocent childlike way.<br><br>

He found a track between two fields, which led deeper into the
countryside. Here there were no signs of war. Streams flowed, a
nightingale sang, a bell chimed the hours, there were flowers in all the
hedges, young green leaves on the trees. He washed his hands and
face in a stream, drank some water from his cupped hands and felt
better. He desperately tried to find some fruit on the trees. He knew
very well it was the wrong time of year, but the young believe in miracles.
At the end of the trac~ he was back on the main road. There
was a sign: CRESSANGE, 22 KILOMETRES. He stopped in confusion, then
saw a farm. After hesitating for a long time, he finally brought himself
to knock on the shutter. He heard footsteps inside the house.
They asked who he was. When he said he was lost and hungry, they
let him in. Three French soldiers were asleep inside. He recognised
them. They had defended the bridge at Moulins. Now they were
stretched out on benches, snoring, their filthy haggard faces thrown
back as if they were dead. A woman watched over them, knitting; a <b>[p.93]</b> 
cat chased her ball of wool as it rolled along the floor. The scene was
at once so familiar and so strange after everything Hubert had seen
during the past week that his legs gave way under him and he had to
sit down. On the table he saw the soldiers’ helmets; they had covered
them with leaves to stop the moonlight reflecting off them.<br><br>

One of the men woke up and pushed himself up on to his elbow.
“Did you see any, lad?” he asked in a low hoarse voice.<br><br>

Hubert realised he meant the Germans. “No,” he said quickly,
“no, not one since Moulins.”<br><br>

“Seems like they don’t even want prisoners any more,” the soldier
said. “Too many. They just take their guns and tell them to bugger
off.”<br><br>

“Seems like it,” said the woman.<br><br>

They fell silent. Hubert ate what they’d given him: a bowl of soup
and some cheese. “What are you going to do now?” he asked the
soldier.<br><br>

His friend had opened his eyes. They debated. One wanted to go
to Cressange.<br><br>

“What for?” the other one replied, sounding devastated. “They’re
everywhere, everywhere...” He looked around him with the sad,
frightened eyes of a stunned bird.<br><br>

He seemed convinced there were Germans all around, ready to
capture him. Now and again he let out a sort of clipped, bitter laugh.
“Good God, to have fought in ‘14 and then see this...”<br><br>

The woman kept on knitting calmly. She was very old and had on
a white fluted bonnet. “I saw ‘70. Now then...” she muttered.<br><br>

Hubert listened to them in horror. They hardly seemed real to
him, more like groaning ghosts conjured up from the pages of his
<i>History of France</i>. My God! The present with all its tragedy was more
important than the glories of the past and its stench of blood. Hubert
drank a cup of hot black coffee, despite the grounds. Then, thanking
the woman and saying goodbye to the soldiers, he set off, determined
to make it to Cressange by morning. From there he could get in touch
with his family to let them know he was all right. At eight in the
morning he found himself in front of a hotel in a small village a few
kilometres from Cressange; he could smell the delicious aroma of <b>[p.94]</b> 
coffee and fresh bread coming from inside. Suddenly Hubert felt he
couldn’t go on, that his legs wouldn’t carry him. He walked into the
hotel where he found a large room full of refugees. No one could tell
him if there were any beds. The owner had gone to see if she could
find some food for this horde of hungry people; she’d be back soon.
He went back out into the street.<br><br>

Up on the first floor a woman sat at a window putting on make-up.
Her lipstick clattered to the ground at Hubert’s feet and he quickly
picked it up. Leaning out to look for it, the woman saw him and
smiled. “How can I get it back?” she asked. And she dangled her bare
arm, her white hand, out of the window.<br><br>

Hubert was dazzled by the sunlight glinting off her polished nails.
Her milky-white skin, her red hair were almost painful to him, like a
blinding light. “I ... I could bring it to you, Madame,” he stammered,
lowering his eyes.<br><br>

“Oh, yes please, if you wouldn’t mind,” she said and smiled again.<br><br>

He went back into the building, through the breakfast room and
up a small, dark staircase. Through an open door he saw a pink room.
In fact, the pink was the effect of sunlight filtering through cheap red
curtains and filling the room with a warm, vibrant light the colour of
rose bushes.<br><br>

The woman, who was polishing her nails, showed him in and took
the lipstick. “Oh, he’s going to faint!” she said, looking at him.
Hubert felt her take his hand and help him walk a few steps to a chair;
she slipped a pillow under his head. His heart was pounding, but he
hadn’t lost consciousness. Everything was whirling around as if he
were seasick, and great waves of hot and cold ran through him, one
after the other.<br><br>

He felt intimidated but rather proud of himself. When she asked
him, “Are you tired? Hungry? What’s wrong, my poor darling?” he
exaggerated the trembling in his voice: “It’s nothing,” he replied,
“it’s just ... I walked here from Moulins where we were defending
the bridge.”<br><br>

She looked at him, surprised. “But how old are you?”
“Eighteen,” he lied.<br><br>

“Are you a soldier?”<br><br>

<b>[p.95]</b><br><br>

“No, I was travelling with my family. I left them. I joined .the
troops.”<br><br>

“That’s wonderful!” she said.<br><br>

Even though she’d spoken with the tone of admiration he’d
hoped for, he blushed when she looked at him; he didn’t know why.
Close up, she didn’t seem young. You could see tiny wrinkles on her
lightly powdered face. She was very slim, very elegant, with magnificent
legs.<br><br>

“What’s your name?” she asked.<br><br>

“Hubert Péricand.”<br><br>

“Isn’t there a Péricand who’s the curator at the Beaux-Arts?”
“He’s my father, Madame.”<br><br>

While they were talking, she had stood up and poured him some
coffee. She had just finished breakfast and the tray with the half-full
coffee pot, cream jug and toast was still on the table.<br><br>

“It’s not very hot,” she said, “but you should have some anyway;
it will do you good.”<br><br>

He obeyed.<br><br>

‘‘It’s such madness downstairs with all those refugees; I could ring
for service all day long and still no one would come! You come from
Paris, of course?”<br><br>

“Yes, and you as well, Madame?”<br><br>

“Yes. I got caught in the bombing at Tours. Now I’m thinking
about going to Bordeaux. Though I imagine the Opera in Bordeaux
has been evacuated.”<br><br>

“Are you an actress, Madame?” Hubert asked respectfully.<br><br>

“A dancer. Arlette Corail.”<br><br>

Hubert had only ever seen dancers on stage at the Châtelet
Theatre. Instinctively he glanced with curiosity and longing at her
long ankles and muscular calves, sheathed in silk stockings. He was
extremely flustered. A lock of his blond hair fell into his eyes.
The woman gently pushed it back with her hand. “And where will
you be going now?”<br><br>

“I don’t know,” Hubert admitted. “My family was staying in a
small village about thirty kilometres from here. I’d go back and find
them, but the Germans must be there by now.”<br><br>

<b>[p.96]</b><br><br>

“We expect them here too, any time now.”<br><br>

“Here?”<br><br>

He started and leapt up as if to run away.<br><br>

She held him back, laughing. “Now what do you think they would
do with you? A young boy like you...”<br><br>

“All the same, I did fight,” he protested, his feelings hurt.<br><br>

“Yes, of course you did, but no one’s going to tell them that, are
they?” She was thinking, frowning slightly. “Listen. This is what
you’re going to do. I’ll go downstairs and ask for a room for you.
They know me here. It’s a very small hotel but marvellous food and
I’ve spent a few weekends here. They can give you their son’s
room-he’s away at the front. Rest for a day or two and then contact
your parents.”<br><br>

“I don’t know how to thank you,” he murmured.<br><br>

She went out. When she came back a few moments later he was
asleep. She wanted to lift his head, put her arms round his broad
shoulders, feel his chest gently rising and falling. She watched him
closely, smoothed back the lock of wild golden hair that had fallen on
to his forehead, then looked at him again with a dreamy, hungry look,
like a cat staring at a little bird. “He’s not at all bad, this boy...”she
sighed.<br><br>

<b>[p.97]</b><br><br>

<h2>19</h2><br><br>

The entire village was waiting for the Germans. Faced with the idea
of seeing their conquerors for the first time, some people felt desperate
shame, others anguish, but many felt only apprehensive curiosity,
as when some astonishing new theatrical event is announced. The
civil servants, police, postmen had all been ordered to leave the day
before. The mayor was staying. He was a placid old farmer with
gout; nothing flustered him. With or without a leader, things in the
village went on much the same. At noon, in the noisy dining room
where Arlette Corail was finishing lunch, some travellers brought
news of the armistice. The women burst into tears. It seemed that the
situation was rather confused. In certain places the army was still resisting
and civilians had joined them. However, everyone agreed that
the army had failed and there was nothing more to be done; they had
no choice but to give up. The room was filled with chatter. It was stiflingly
hot.<br><br>

Arlette pushed away her plate and went out into the hotel’s small
garden. She had some cigarettes, a deckchair, a book. She’d left Paris
a week earlier so panic-stricken she’d felt close to madness; now, despite
having met with real danger, she was herself again: perfectly
calm and collected. What’s more, she was convinced that, from now
on, she could survive any situation, that she was gifted with a real genius
for obtaining maximum pleasure and comfort regardless of the
circumstances. Her flexibility, lucidity, detachment were qualities that
had been of enormous use to her in her career and relationships, but
until now she hadn’t realised they would be just as useful in a crisis.<br><br>

When she thought of how she had begged Corbin’s help she
smiled scornfully. They had arrived in Tours just in time to be
bombed; Corbin’s suitcase with his personal effects and the bank’s
<b>[p.98]</b> documents had been buried in the rubble, while she had emerged
from the disaster without having lost a single handkerchief, a single
box of make-up, a single pair of shoes. She had seen Corbin’s face
distorted with terror and thought how much pleasure she would get
from reminding him of it, often. Then she remembered his drooping,
corpse-like jaw; she’d wanted to give him a chin strap to hold it
closed. Pathetic! Leaving him in Tours amid the terrible confusion
and chaos, she’d taken the car, managed to find some petrol and left.
She’d spent two days in this village, where she’d had good food
and lodgings, while a pathetic crowd of people camped in barns and
in the village square. She had even allowed herself the luxury of
being chantable by leaving her room for that lovely boy, that young
Péricand . . . Péricand? They were an upper-middle-class family,
dull, respectable, very rich, with excellent connections in the government,
among diplomats and wealthy industrialists, thanks to their relatives
from Lyon . . . the Maltêtes ... She sighed with annoyance,
realising she would now have to rethink everything. How irritating,
too, that she’d recently gone to so much trouble to seduce Gerard
Salomon-Worms, the Count de Furières’s brother-in-law. A quite
useless conquest that had cost her a great deal of time and effort.<br><br>

Frowning slightly, Arlette studied her fingernails. The ten little
sparkling mirrors seemed to put her in a pensive mood. Her lovers
knew that when she contemplated her hands in this reflective malicious
way, it meant she was about to express her opinion on things
like politics, art, literature and fashion, and that, in general, her opinions
were insightful and just. For a few seconds, in this little garden in
bloom, while bumblebees gathered pollen from a bush with scarlet
bell-shaped flowers, the dancer imagined the future. She came to the
conclusion that for her nothing would change. Her wealth consisted
of jewellery-which could only increase in value-and property
(she’d made some good investments in the Midi, before the war). Yet
they were mere trimmings. Her principal assets were her legs, her figure,
her scheming mind-things vulnerable only to time. But there
was the rub . . . She immediately thought of her age and, taking a
mirror from her handbag in the way that you touch a good-luck
charm to ward off evil spirits, looked carefully at her face. An unpleasant
thought occurred to her: she used nothing but American <b>[p.99]</b> 
make-up. It had been difficult to get hold of any for a few weeks now.
That put her in a bad mood. So what! Things might change on the
surface but underneath everything would be the same. There would
be new rich men, just as there always were after great disasters—men
prepared to pay dearly for their pleasures because their money had
come easily and so would love. But please, dear God, let all thts chaos
end quickly! Please let us get back to a normal way of life, what~ver
it might be; these wars, revolutions, great historical upheavals mtght
be exciting to men, but to women ... Women felt nothing but boredom.
She was positive that every woman would agree with her: they
were tired of crying, bored to death by all these noble words and
noble feelings! As for men ... it was hard to know, difficult to say · · ·
In some ways those simple souls were incomprehensible, whereas for
at least fifty years women had been concerned only with the commonplace,
the ordinary ... She looked up. and saw the owner of the
little hotel leaning out of the wmdow, looking at something. What is
it Madame Goulot?” she asked.<br><br>

“Mademoiselle,” the woman replied in a solemn, trembling voice, 
“it’s them ... they’re coming ...”<br><br>

“The Germans?”<br><br>

“Yes.”<br><br>

The dancer was about to get up to go to the gate so she could see
down the road, but she was afraid to in case someone took her
deckchair and her spot in the shade, so she stayed where she was.
It wasn’t the Germans who were coming but <i>one</i> German: the first.
From behind closed doors, through half-closed shutters, from attic
windows, the entire village watched him arrive. He stopped his motorcycle
in the deserted village square. He had on a green uniform,
gloves and a helmet with a visor. When he raised his head, you could
see a rosy, thin, almost childlike face. “But he’s so young!” murmured
the women. Without actually realising it, they were expectmg
some vision from the Apocalypse, some terrifying, foreign monster.
Since he looked around expectantly, the newsagent, who had fought
in ‘14 and wore his Croix de Guerre and military medals on the inside
of his old grey jacket, came out of his shop and walked towards
the enemy. For a moment, the two men just stood there, face-to-face,
without saying a word. Then the German took out a cigarette <b>[p.100]</b> 
and asked for a light in bad French. The newsagent replied in bad
German; he had been among the occupying forces in Mainz in ‘18.
There was such total silence (the whole village was holding its
breath) that you could hear each and every word. The German asked
for directions.<br><br>

The Frenchman replied, then became bolder: “Has the armistice
been signed?”<br><br>

The German threw open his arms. “We don’t know yet. We hope
so,” he said.<br><br>

And the humanity of his words, his gesture, everything proved
they were not dealing with some bloodthirsty monster but with a simple
soldier like any other; and suddenly the ice was broken between
the town and the enemy, between the country folk and the invader.<br><br>

“He doesn’t seem so bad,” the women whispered.<br><br>

He smiled and then, raising his hand to his helmet, made an unconfident,
half-finished gesture: not quite a military salute but not a
civilian greeting either. He glanced curiously at the closed windows
for a moment, started up his motorcycle and disappeared. One after
the other, doors opened and the entire village spilled out into the
square until the newsagent was surrounded. Standing motionless, his
hands in his pockets, he was frowning and staring into the distance.
Contradictory expressions appeared on his face: relief it was all over,
sadness and anger that it had all ended this way, memories of the
past, fear of the future; and all these feelings were mirrored in the
faces around him. The women dried tears from their eyes; the men
stood silent, looking obstinate and hostile. The children, distracted
from their games for a moment, turned back to their marbles and
hopscotch. The sky was shining with the kind of brilliant, silvery
light you sometimes find in the middle of a truly beautiful day; an almost
imperceptible iridescent mist hovered in the air and all the fresh
colours of June were intensified, looked richer and softer, as if reflected
through a prism.<br><br>

The hours passed by peacefully. There were fewer cars on the
road. Bicycles still sped along as if caught up in the angry wind that
had been blowing in from the north-east for over a week now, dragging
with them their miserable human cargo. A little while later there <b>[p.101]</b> 
was a surprising sight: cars appeared-travelling in the opposite direction
from a week ago. People were going back to Paris. When they
saw that, the villagers finally believed it was all over. They went
home. Once again you could hear the women rattling the dishes as
they washed them in their kitchens, the faint footsteps of an old
woman going to feed her rabbits, even a little girl singing as she drew
water from a pump. Dogs rolled around, playing in the dust.<br><br>

It was an exquisite evening with clear skies and blue shadows; the
last rays of the setting sun caressed the roses, while the church bells
called the faithful to prayer. But then a noise rose up from the road, a
noise unlike any they’d heard these past few days, a low, steady rumbling
that seemed to move slowly closer, heavy and relentless. Trucks
were heading towards the village. This time it really was the Germans.
The trucks stopped in the village square and men got out; others
pulled up behind them, then more and still more. In a few seconds the
whole of the old, dusty square, from the church to the municipal hall,
became a dark, still mass of grey vehicles with a few faded branches
clinging to them, the remains of their camouflage.<br><br>

There were so many! Silently, cautiously, people came out on to
their doorsteps again. They tried in vain to count the flood of soldiers.
Germans were coming from all directions. They filled the
squares and streets—more and more of them, endlessly. The villagers
hadn’t heard the sound of footsteps in the street, young voices, laughter,
since September. They were stunned by the noise emerging from
this wave of green uniforms, by the scent of these healthy men, their
young flesh, and especially by the sound of this foreign language.
Germans poured into the houses, the shops, the cafes; Their boots
clanked over the red tiles of the kitchens. They asked for food, dnnk.
They stroked the children as they went by. They threw open their
arms, they sang, they laughed with the women. Their obvious happiness,
their delight at being conquerors, their feverish bliss—a bliss
combined with a touch of wonder, as if they themselves could hardly
believe what had happened—all this contained such drama, such excitement,
that the defeated villagers forgot their sadness and bitterness
for a few seconds. They just stood and watched, speechless.<br><br>

In the little hotel, below the room where Hubert was still sleeping, <b>[p.102]</b> 
the main room echoed with songs and shouting. The Germans had
immediately demanded champagne (Sekt! Nahrung!) and corks flew
from their hands. Some of them were playing billiards, others went
into the kitchen carrying piles of raw pink pork cutlets which they
threw on to the fire; the meat sizzled and let off thick smoke as it
cooked. The soldiers brought bottles of beer up from the cellar, impatiently
pushing aside the waitress who wanted to help them; a
young man with a rosy complexion and a mass of golden hair was
cracking eggs open on the edge of the stove; in the garden, someone
else was picking the first strawberries of summer. Two half-naked
young boys were dipping their heads in buckets of cold water drawn
from the well. They ate their fill, gorged themselves with all the good
things the gardens provided; they had cheated death, they were
young, alive, they were conquerors! Their excitement spilled out in
urgent, rapid chatter; they spoke bad French to anyone who would
listen to them, pointing to their boots, saying over and over again,
“We walking, walking, comrades falling and we always walking...”
The clinking of weapons, belts, helmets filled the room.<br><br>

Hubert could hear it in his dream and, confusing it with his memories
of the day before, imagined once more the battle on the Moulins
bridge. He tossed about, sighing and moaning as if in pain, fighting
off some invisible person. When he finally woke up, he was in a
strange bedroom. He’d slept all day. He could see the full moon shining
through the open window. Hubert started, rubbed his eyes and
looked at the dancer, who had come in while he was asleep. He muttered
his thanks and apologies.<br><br>

“You must be hungry,” she said. It was true, he was famished.
“You know, perhaps it would be better if you had dinner here with
me? It’s unbearable downstairs; there are soldiers everywhere.”<br><br>

“Soldiers!” he said, rushing towards the door. “What are they saying?
Are things looking any better? Where are the Germans?”<br><br>

“The Germans? But they’re here. It’s the German soldiers who
are downstairs.”<br><br>

He leapt away from her in surprise, as fearful as a hunted animal.<br><br>

“The Germans? No, you’re joking?” He tried in vain to find some other
words and then repeated in a low, shaky voice, “You’re joking ... ?”<br><br>

<b>[p.103]</b><br><br>

She opened the door; the smell of thick, acrid smoke rose up from
the room downstairs, along with the unmistakable sound of a group
of victorious soldiers: shouting, laughter, singing, their noisy boots,
the clanging of heavy guns thrown on to the marble tables, the crashing
of helmets against metal belt buckles, and the joyous roar from a
proud, happy crowd, intoxicated by their victory, like the winning
team at a rugby match, Hubert thought. He found it almost impossible
not to shout out insults or collapse in tears. Rushing to the window,
he looked outside. The street was starting to empty, but four
men were walking abreast, rapping on the doors of the houses as they
passed, shouting, “Lights out!” One after the other, lights were submissively
switched off. All that remained was the moonlight, which
cast a dull blue glow as it shimmered off the helmets and grey gun
barrels. Hubert was shaking; he grabbed the curtain with both hands,
pressed it against his mouth and burst into tears.<br><br>

“Come on, now,” the woman said, stroking his shoulder and feeling
mildly sorry for him. “There’s nothing we can do about it, is
there? What can we do? All the tears in the world won’t change anything.
There are better times ahead. We have to live to see the better
times, first and foremost we have to live ... to go on ... But you acted
very bravely ... If everyone had been as brave as you ... and you’re
so young! Almost a child...”<br><br>

He shook his head.<br><br>

“No?” she said, lowering her voice. “Are you a man, then?”<br><br>

She fell silent. Her fingers were trembling slightly and she dug her
nails into the boy’s arm as if she were grabbing hold of some fresh
prey and kneading it before biting into it to satisfy her hunger. “Don’t
cry,” she said very quietly, her voice faltering. “Only children cry.
You’re a man. When a man is unhappy he knows what he needs...”
She waited for a response but he said nothing and lowered his eyes.
His mouth was closed and sad, but his nose wrinkled and his nostrils
quivered slightly. So she said in a very quiet voice, “Love...”

<b>[p.104]</b><br><br>

<h2>20</h2><br><br>

In the room where the Pericand children were sleeping, Albert the
cat had made his bed. First he’d climbed on to Jacqueline’s small floral
quilt and started to paw at it, gnawing at the cotton fabric that
smelled of glue and fruit, but Nanny had come in and chased him
away. Three times in a row, as soon as she’d turned away, he’d returned
with a silent, graceful leap, but finally he’d had to admit defeat
and so had curled up at the back of an armchair under Jacqueline’s
dressing gown. Sleep filled the room. The children were resting
peacefully and Nanny had fallen asleep while saying her rosary. The
cat, absolutely still, stared intently with one green eye at the rosary
gleaming in the moonlight; the other eye remained closed. His body
was hidden by the pink flannel dressing gown. Little by little, extremely
quietly, one leg emerged, then the other; he stretched them
out and felt them tremble slightly, all the way from his shoulder
joint-that steel spring hidden beneath a soft, warm fur coat-right
down to his hard, transparent claws. He sprang forward, jumped on
to Nanny’s bed and stared at her for a long time without moving;
only the ends of his delicate whiskers quivered. He stretched one paw
forward and started playing with the rosary beads; they hardly
moved at first, but then he began to enjoy the smooth, cool feel of
these perfect, tiny balls rolling between his claws; he swiped at them
harder and the rosary fell to the floor. The cat took fright and disappeared
under an armchair.<br><br>

A while later Emmanuel woke up and started crying. The windows
and shutters were both open. The moon lit up the rooftops in
the village; the tiles glistened like the scales on a fish. The garden was
fragrant, peaceful, and the silvery light seemed to shimmer like clear
water, gently rising and falling over the fruit trees.<br><br>

<b>[p.105]</b> <br><br>



The cat poked his nose through the fringes of the armchair and
studied the scene with a dreamy expression. He was a very young cat
who had only ever lived in the city, where the scent of such June
nights was· far away. Occasionally he had caught a whiff of something
warm and intoxicating, but nothing like here where the smell
rose up to his whiskers and took hold of him, making his head spin.
Eyes half closed, he could feel waves of powerful, sweet perfume running
through him: the pungent smell of the last lilacs, the sap running
through the trees, the cool, dark earth, the animals, birds, moles, mice,
all the prey, the musky scent of fur, of skin, the smell of blood ... His
mouth gaping with longing, he jumped on to the window sill and
walked slowly along the drainpipe. This was where a strong hand
had grabbed him the night before and thrown him back to J acqueline
who was crying in bed. But he would not allow himself to be caught
tonight.<br><br>

He eyed the distance from the drainpipe to the ground. It was an
easy jump, but he appeared to want to flatter himself by exaggerating
the difficulty of the leap. He balanced his hindquarters, looking fierce
and confident, swept his long black tail across the drainpipe and, ears
pulled back, leapt forward, landing on the freshly tilled earth. He hesitated
for a moment, then buried his muzzle in the ground. Now he
was in the very black of night, at the heart of it, at the darkest point.
He needed to sniff the earth: here, between the roots and the pebbles,
were smells untainted by the scent of humans, smells that had yet to
waft into the air and vanish. They were warm, secretive, eloquent.
Alive. Each and every scent meant there was some small living creature,
hiding, happy, edible ... June bugs, field mice, crickets and that
small toad whose voice seemed full of crystallised tears ... The eat’s
long ears-pink triangles tinged with silver, pointed and delicately
curly inside like the flower on bindweed-suddenly shot up. He was
listening to faint noises in the shadows, so delicate, so mysterious but,
to him alone, so clear: the rustling of wisps of straw in nests where
birds watch over their young, the flutter of feathers, the sound of
pecking on bark, the beating of insect wings, the patter of mice gently
scratching the ground, even the faint bursting of seeds opening.
Golden eyes flashed by in the darkness. There were sparrows <b>[p.106]</b> sleep
 ing under leaves, fat blackbirds, nightingales; the male nightingales
were already awake, singing to one another in the, forest and along
the river banks.<br><br>

There were other sounds as well: the steady thud of explosions,
rising and bursting forth like flowers and, when the noise stopj>ed, the
rattling of every window-pane in the village, the banging of shutters
being opened and closed, anxious words flying from window to window.
At first, the cat had started every time he heard an explosion, his
tail stiff, his fur bristling, his whiskers tense with fear. But he had got
used to the way the rumble came closer and closer, no doubt imagining
it was thunder. He leapt about in the flower beds, pulled the petals
off a rose with his claws (the rose was in full bloom; the slightest
breeze could destroy it; its white petals would fall to the ground, like
soft, sweet-smelling rain). Suddenly, as quick as a squirrel, the cat
darted up a tree, ripping the bark with his claws. Terrified birds flew
off. At the end of a branch he began a savage, arrogant dance, taunting
in his bold, warlike way, the sky, the earth, the animals, the moon.
Now and again he opened his deep, narrow mouth and let out a piercing
miaow, a sharp, provocative call to all the cats nearby.
The birds in the henhouse and the dovecote all woke up and hid<br><br>

their heads beneath their wings, catching the scent of fate and death;
a small white hen tentatively climbed on to a metal drinking trough,
knocked it over and rushed away, making terrified screeching noises.
But the cat had jumped on to the ground now. He stood motionless
... waiting. His round golden eyes shone in the darkness. There
was the sound of leaves rustling and he came back carrying a small
dead bird in his mouth, his tongue slowly lapping at its wound. Eyes
closed, he savoured the warm blood. He had plunged his claws into
the bird’s heart and clenched and unclenched his talons, digging
deeper and deeper into the tender flesh that covered its delicate bones
with slow and rhythmical movements until its heart stopped beating.
He ate the bird slowly, then licked himself clean, polishing the tip of
his beautiful bushy tail, which was moist and shiny from the damp
night air. He was feeling benevolent now: when a shrew darted between
his legs he let it go; he was content merely to swipe at a mole’s
head, leaving it only half dead, a trail of blood on its muzzle. He
<b>[p.107]</b> studied the mole with a scornful trembling of his nostrils but didn’t
touch it. A different kind of hunger had arisen within him; he arched
his back, raised his head and miaowed again, a call that ended in a
harsh, imperious cry. An old red pussycat suddenly appeared on the
roof of the henhouse, basking in the moonlight.<br><br>

The short June night was fading. The stars grew paler, the air
smelled of milk and moist grass; now, half-hidden behind the forest,
only the pink tip of the moon could be seen, growing dimmer and
dimmer in the mist. Tired, triumphant and covered in dew, the cat
gnawed on a sprig of grass, then slipped back into Jacqueline’s room,
on to her bed, looking for that warm spot near her thin feet. He was
purring like a kettle on the boil.<br><br>

A few seconds later, the arsenal exploded.<br><br>


<b>[p.108]</b><br><br>


<h2>21</h2><br><br>

The arsenal exploded and the horrible echo of the explosion had only
just stopped (the air all around them shook; all the doors and windows
were vibrating and the small wall at the cemetery crumbled)
when a long flame shot up, whistling, from the bell tower. The noise
of the incendiary bomb had merged with the explosion of the arsenal.
In a second, the entire village was in flames. There was hay in the
barns, straw in the lofts. Everything caught fire. Roofs caved in,
floors cracked in half; the refugees rushed into the streets while
the villagers ran to open the cowsheds and stables to save the animals.
The horses were neighing, rearing, terrified by the intensity
of the noise and fire; they refused to come out and beat their heads
and hoofs against the burning walls. A cow rushed by, bellowing in
pain and terror as it frantically tried to shake a bale of burning hay
from its horns; pieces of glowing straw flew everywhere. In the
garden, the blossoming trees were bathed in a red-as-blood light.
Normally, the firemen would have come and people would have
calmed down, once the initial fear had passed. But this disaster, happening
after so many others, was more than they ~ould bear. Also,
they knew the firemen had received orders to leave with all their
equipment three days before. They felt hopeless. “If only the men
were here,” cried the women, “the men!” But the men were far away
and the children were running, screaming, rushing about, causing
even greater confusion.<br><br>

The refugees were howling in terror. Among them were the
Pericands, half-dressed, faces dirty, hair dishevelled. It was the same
as when the bombs had fallen on the road: everyone was shouting at
once, calling to one another, and the voices all merged into onethe
village was reduced to a roar. “Jean!,” “Suzanne!,” “Mummy!,”
<b>[p.109]</b> “Grandma!” No one replied. A few youngsters who had managed to
get their bicycles out of the burning sheds pushed them violently
through the crowd. Yet, oddly enough, everyone believed that they
were r~maining calm, that they were behaving exactly as they should.
Madame Pericand ;was holding Emmanuel in her arms, Jacqueline
and Bernard were clutching her skirt (Jacqueline had eve~ managed
to get the cat back into his basket when her mother had pulled her out
of bed and she now gripped it tightly to her). “The most precious
things have been saved!” Madame Pericand said to herself over .and
over again, “Thank you God!” Her jewellery and money were sewn
into a suede pouch pinned inside her blouse and she could feel it
against her chest as she ran. She’d had the presence of mind to grab
her fur coat and the small overnight case full of the family silver,
which she’d kept beside her bed. She had her children, her three children!
Sometimes a thought shot through her, as sharp and rapid as
lightning, of her two older sons, in danger, far away: Philippe and
that mad Hubert. She’d been desperate when Hubert ran away, yet
rather proud of him. His behaviour had been irrational, wild, but
manly. For them, Philippe and Hubert, she could do nothing, but her
three little ones! She had saved her three little ones! She was sure
she’d had a premonition the night before; she’d put them to bed halfdressed.
Jacqueline didn’t have a dress on but a jacket covered her
naked shoulders; she wouldn’t be cold; it was better than wearing just
a blouse; the baby was wrapped up in a blanket; Bernard even had his
beret on. She herself had no stockings, just red slippers on her bare
feet, but gritting her teeth, arms tight round the baby, who wasn’t
crying but whose eyes were rolling wildly with fear, she made her
way through the panic-stricken crowd, without the slightest idea
where she was going. The sky above seemed filled with countless
planes (there were two) flying back and forth with their evil buzzing,
like hornets.<br><br>

“Please don’t let them bomb us any more! Please don’t let them
bomb us any more! Please ... “ These words went round and round
endlessly in her bowed head. Out loud she said, “Don’t let go of my
hand, Jacqueline! Bernard, stop crying! You’re behaving like a girl!
There, there, baby, don’t worry, Mummy’s here!” She said these <b>[p.110]</b> 
words mechanically, while silently continuing to pray: “Please don’t
let them bomb us any more! Let them bomb anyone else, dear God,
but not us! I have three children! I have to save them! Please don’t let
them bomb us any more!”<br><br>

They finally made it out of the narrow village street; she was in
the open countryside; the fire was behind her; the flames fanned out
across the sky. Scarcely an hour had passed since dawn, when the
bomb had struck the bell tower. They were passed by car upon car
fleeing Paris, Dijon, Normandy, the Lorraine region, France itself.
The people inside them were numb. Sometimes they raised their
heads to look at the fire in the distance, but their faces were indifferent.
They had seen so many things ...<br><br>

Nanny was walking behind Madame Pericand. She seemed mute
with terror; her lips were moving but she made no sound. She was
holding her fluted bonnet with its cotton ties, newly ironed. Madame
Pericand looked at her indignantly. “Really, Nanny, couldn’t you
have found something more useful to bring? Honestly!” The old
woman made an extraordinary effort to speak. She went red in the
face, her eyes filled with tears. “Good Lord,” thought Madame
Pericand, “now she’s going mad! Whatever will I do?”<br><br>

But the harsh voice of her mistress had miraculously returned the
gift of speech to Nanny ... She replied in her usual tone of voice,
simultaneously respectful and bitter: “Madame didn’t think I would
leave it behind? It’s valuable!” This bonnet was a bone of contention
between them: Nanny hated the hats she was forced to wear-”so
suitable,” Madame Pericand thought, “so appropriate for a servant,”
for she felt that each social class should wear some sign indicative of
their station to avoid any misconceptions, just as shops displayed
price tags. “You can tell it’s not she who does the washing and ironing,
nasty old bag!” Nanny would say as she worked. Her hands
trembling, she put the lace butterfly of a bonnet on over the enormous
nightcap she was already wearing.<br><br>

Madame Pericand looked at her, thought there was something odd
about her but couldn’t say exactly what it was. Everything seemed
incredible. The world was a horrible dream. She dropped down on to
the verge, put Emmanuel back into Nanny’s arms and said as vehemently
as possible, “Now we have to get out of here,” and remained <b>[p.111]</b> 
on the ground, waiting for some miracle. There was none, but a donkey
pulling a Jcart passed by. When she saw the driver slow down at
the sight of her and her children, Madame Pericand’s intuition took
over-the intuition innate to the wealthy who can always tell when
and where something can be bought.<br><br>

“Stop!” Madame Pericand shouted. “Where’s the nearest railway
station?”<br><br>

“Saint-Georges.”<br><br>

“How long would it take you to get there with your donkey?”<br><br>

“Well, about four hours.”<br><br>

“Are the trains still running?”<br><br>

“I’ve heard they are.”<br><br>

“Good. I’m getting in. Come on, Bernard, Nanny, bring the
baby.”<br><br>

“But Madame, I wasn’t going that way and what with going and coming back, that’ll be at least eight hours.”<br><br>

“You’ll be well paid,” said Madame Pericand.<br><br>

She climbed into the carriage, calculating that if the trains
were running normally, she would be in Nimes the next morning.
Nimes ... her mother’s dear old house, her bedroom, a bath; she
nearly fainted at the thought. Would there be enough room for her on
the train? “With three children,” she said to herself, “I’m sure to
manage it.” Because of her position as the mother of a large family,
Madame Pericand was usually treated like royalty and came first
wherever she was ... nor was she the kind of woman who allowed
anyone to forget what was rightfully hers. She crossed her arms and
studied the countryside victoriously.<br><br>

“But, Madame, what about the car?” Nanny moaned.<br><br>

“It’ll be reduced to ashes by now,” replied Madame Pericand.<br><br>

“What about the trunks, the children’s things?”<br><br>

The trunks had been loaded on to the servants’ van. Only three
suitcases were left by the time disaster struck, three suitcases full of
linen ...<br><br>

“I’ll just have to do without them.” Madame Pericand sighed,
looking up at the sky, picturing once more, as in a wonderful dream,
the deep wardrobes in Nimes with their treasured cambric and linen.
Nanny, who had lost her big trunk with the metal bands and an <b>[p.112]</b> 
imitation pigskin handbag, began to cry. Madame Pericand tried in vain
to make her see how ungrateful she was being towards Providence.
“Remember that you are alive, my dear Nanny; nothing else matters!”
The donkey trotted on. The farmer took small side roads thick
with refugees. At eleven o’clock they arrived at Saint-Georges and
Madame Pericand managed to get on a train heading in the direction
of N1mes. Everyone around her was saying the armistice had been
signed. Impossible, some said. Nevertheless, there was no more gunfire,
no bombs were falling. “Could this nightmare finally be over?”
thought Madame Pericand. She looked again at everything she had
brought, “everything she had saved”: her children, her overnight
case. She placed her hand over the jewellery and money sewn into her
blouse. Yes, during this terrible time she had acted with determination,
courage and composure. She hadn’t lost her head! She hadn’t
lost ... She hadn’t ... Suddenly she cried out in a choked voice. She
clutched her throat and fell backwards, letting out a low moan as if
she were suffocating.<br><br>

“My God, Madame! Madame, what’s the matter?” exclaimed
Nanny.<br><br>

“Nanny, my dear Nanny,” Madame Pericand finally groaned in a
barely audible voice, “We forgot ... “<br><br>

“What? What did we forget?”<br><br>

“We forgot my father-in-law,” said Madame Pericand, dissolving
into tears.<br><br>


<b>[p.113]</b> <br><br>


<h2>22</h2><br><br>


Charles Langelet had driven all night long from Paris to Montargis
and so had shared in the general misfortune. Nevertheless, he demonstrated
great strength of character. In the hostelry where he stopped
for lunch, the groups of refugees around him were complaining
about the horrors they had encountered on the journey. They looked
to him for confirmation, saying, “Isn’t that so, Monsieur? You saw it
too, didn’t you? No one can accuse us of exaggerating!” but he
merely replied, drily, “<i>I</i> didn’t see anything.”<br><br>

“What? No bombs?” asked the surprised owner.<br><br>

“No, Madame.”<br><br>

“No fires?”<br><br>

“Not even a traffic accident.”<br><br>

“Well, lucky you,” the woman said after thinking for a moment
and shrugging her shoulders doubtfully, as if to say, “He’s peculiar!”<br><br>

Langelet took a bite of the omelette he’d just been served, pushed
it away mumbling “inedible,” asked for his bill and left. He got a kind
of perverse pleasure from depriving these good souls of the satisfaction
they hoped to attain by questioning him, for <i>they</i>-vulgar, vile
creatures that they were-imagined they were feeling compassion
for all mankind, while in reality they were merely thrilled by base,
melodramatic curiosity. “It’s unbelievable how much vulgarity there
is!” Charles Langelet thought sadly. He was always pained and scandalised
when he encountered the real world full of unfortunate people
who had never seen a cathedral, a statue, a painting. What was
tnore, the <i>happy few</i>, among whom he flattered himself he belonged,
displayed the same spinelessness, the same stupidity in the face of
misfortune as these common types. Lord! Just think of what these
people would make of this “exodus,” “<i>their</i> exodus” later on. He <b>[p.114]</b>  
could just hear them: “<i>I</i> wasn’t afraid of the Germans, not me,” an old
bag would whine, “I went straight up to them and said, ‘This house
belongs to the mother of a French officer’-and they didn’t say a
word.” And another woman would say, “Bullets were flying all
around me, but it’s funny, I wasn’t scared, not a bit.” It was understood
that everyone would embellish their tales with terrifying scenes.<br><br>

As for Charles, he would simply reply, “That’s odd. Everything
seemed quite normal to me. There were a lot of people on the road,
but that’s all.” He imagined their surprise and smiled, feeling smug.
He needed to feel smug. When he thought about his apartment in
Paris, his heart broke. Now and again he turned round towards the
back of the car to look lovingly at the crates containing his porcelain,
his greatest treasures. There was a Capodimonte group he was worried
about: he wondered if he’d put enough wood shavings and tissue
paper round it. There wasn’t much tissue paper left by the time he’d
finished wrapping everything. It was a centrepiece for a table: young
women dancing with cupids and fawns. He sighed. In his mind, he
thought of himself as a Roman fleeing the lava and ash of Pompeii,
abandoning his slaves, his house, his gold, but taking with him, in the
folds of his tunic, some terracotta figurine, a perfectly shaped vase, or
a bowl modelled on a beautiful breast.<br><br>

He felt simultaneously comforted and bitter at being so different
from other people. He looked out at them with his pale eyes. The
wave of cars was still moving and all the anxious, sombre faces were
the same. What a sad breed! What were they thinking about? What
they would eat, what they would drink? He was thinking about the
cathedral in Rouen, the chateaux of the Loire, the Louvre. A single
one of those venerable stones was worth more than a thousand
human lives. He was approaching Gien. A black spot appeared in the
sky. In a flash he realised that the stream of refugees near the level
crossing would be a sitting target for an enemy plane so he pulled off
on to a side road. Fifteen minutes later, there was a crash only a few
metres away from him. Other cars also trying to avoid the main road
collided with each other when a terrified driver took a wrong turn.
They rebounded off each other into the fields, shedding luggage,
mattresses, birdcages, injured women. Charlie heard confused sounds <b>[p.115]</b> 
but didn’t turn round. He headed at full speed towards a thick
wood. There he stopped his car, waited a moment, then set off again
through the countryside. The main highway was clearly becoming
too dangerous.<br><br>

He stopped thinking about the dangers the Rouen cathedral might
face for a moment to imagine very precisely what was threatening
him, Charles Langelet. He didn’t want to dwell on it, but the most
unpleasant images filled his mind. His large, delicate, slim hands
clenched the steering wheel, trembling slightly. There were few cars
and houses where he was, and he had no idea were he was going. He
had always had a bad sense of direction. He wasn’t used to travelling
without a chauffeur. For a while he got lost in the outskirts of Gien,
becoming ever more agitated for fear he might run out of petrol. He
sighed and shook his head. He had predicted what would happen:
he, Charles Langelet, was not made for this uncouth existence. The
thousand little pitfalls of daily life were too much for him. The car
stopped: out of petrol. He made a small gracious gesture to himself,
as one bows before the inevitable. There was nothing to be done, he
would have to spend the night in the woods.<br><br>

“You wouldn’t possibly have a can of petrol you could let me
have?” he asked a passing driver.<br><br>

The man said no and Charlie smiled, depressed and bitter. “Well,
that’s the human race for you! Egotistical and mean. In times of misfortune,
no one will share with his brother, not a crust of bread, not a
bottle of beer, not a pathetic little can of petrol.”<br><br>

The driver turned round and shouted at him, “There’s some
about ten kilometres from here, in ... “<br><br>

The name of the hamlet was lost as he drove off but Charlie had
already started to walk towards the trees. He thought he could make
out one or two houses.<br><br>

“But what about the car? I can’t leave the car!” Charlie said to
himself in despair. “Let’s try to start it again.” Nothing happened.
He was covered with dust as thick as chalk.<br><br>

A car was slowly making its way towards him. It was jammed with
young people, some even clinging to the running board and the roof,
like flies. They seemed drunk. “What a bunch of louts,” Langelet <b>[p.116]</b> 
thought, shuddering. Nevertheless, he spoke to them in his most
pleasant voice. “You gentlemen wouldn’t happen to have a drop of
petrol? I’m stuck.”<br><br>

They stopped with a horrible screeching of overworked brakes,
looked at Charlie and sniggered. “What’s it worth?” one of them finally
said.<br><br>

Charlie knew very well he should have replied, “However much
you want!” but he was mean and, moreover, he was afraid these
tramps would be tempted to rob him if they thought he was too rich.
Truth be told, he was terrified of being duped. “I’d pay a reasonable
price,” he replied haughtily.<br><br>

“There ain’t none,” said the driver of the jerky, creaking car, and
drove off along the sandy road through the forest while Langelet, beside
himself, waved his arms about and shouted at him.<br><br>

“Wait a minute, wait! Stop! At least tell me how much you want!”<br><br>

They didn’t even reply. He was alone. But not for long, for night
was falling and refugees were gradually coming into the forest. They
hadn’t been able to find rooms in a hotel; even the private houses
were completely full, so they had decided to spend the night in the
woods. Soon it was just like a July campsite in Elisabethville, Langelet
thought, feeling sick to his stomach. Children were squealing, the
mossy ground was littered with discarded newspaper, dirty clothes
and empty tins of food. Some of the women were crying, others were
shouting or laughing. Horrible filthy children came up to Charles,
who chased them away by rolling his eyes at them angrily but without
raising his voice, for he didn’t want any trouble from their parents.
“They’re the dregs of the dregs, from Belleville,” he mumbled,
horrified. “How did I end up here?” Had chance brought him together
with the inhabitants of one of the worst neighbourhoods in
Paris, or had Charlie’s vivid, anxious imagination got the better of
him? All the men looked like bandits, the women like con artists.<br><br>

Soon it was completely dark, and beneath the thick trees, the
translucent shadows of a June night were transformed into black
shade interspersed with silver glades, drenched in moonlight. Every
sound echoed, distinct and sinister: the planes flying across the sky,
the night birds, the distant explosions--either gunfire or tyres bursting,
you couldn’t be sure. Once or twice a prowler stared at Charles <b>[p.117]</b> 
maliciously. He heard things that made him shudder. People weren’t
thinking straight ... They kept talking about rich people who’d run
away to save their skins and their money, jamming up the roads,
while poor people had only their own two legs and had to walk ‘til
they dropped down exhausted. “Well, <i>they’re</i> not those poor people;
they’ve got cars,” Charlie thought, outraged, “and stolen no doubt!”<br><br>

He was extremely relieved when a little car pulled up next to him
with a young man and woman who were clearly a better class of people
than the other refugees. The young man’s arm was slightly deformed;
he held it in front of him ostentatiously, as if it carried a sign,
in big letters, which read UNFIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE. The woman
was young, pretty, and very fair. They shared some sandwiches and
soon fell asleep in the front of the car, leaning against each other,
cheek to cheek. Charlie tried to sleep as well, but fatigue, overexcitement,
fear kept him awake. An hour later the young man in the car
opened his eyes, gently disentangled himself from the young woman
and lit a cigarette. He saw that Langelet was also awake.<br><br>

“This is so bad!” he said quietly, leaning towards him.<br><br>

“Yes, it’s very bad.”<br><br>

“Well, the night will go by fast. I hope to make it to Beaugency tomorrow
by taking the side roads because the main road down there is
impossible.”<br><br>

“Really? And it seems there’s been some heavy bombing too.
Well, you’re lucky,” Charlie said. “I haven’t got a drop of petrol
left.” He paused. “If I could impose on you to watch my car for a
while” (he really does seem like an honest person, he thought), “I
could go to the next village where I heard I could get some.”<br><br>

The young man shook his head. “Unfortunately, Monsieur,
there’s none left. I bought the last cans ... and at an outrageous
price.” He pointed to the petrol cans tied to the back of the car. “I
have just enough to get to the Loire and cross the bridges before 
they’re blown up.”<br><br>

“What? They’re going to blow up all the bridges?”<br><br>

“That’s what everyone’s saying. They’re going to fight along the
Loire.”<br><br>

“So you think there’s no petrol at all?”<br><br>

“Oh, I’m sure of it! I would have been glad to let you have some <b>[p.118]</b> 
but I only have just enough for myself. I have to get my fiancee to
safety at her parents’ house. They live in Bergerac. Once we’ve
crossed the Loire, it will be easy to find petrol, I hope.”<br><br>

“Oh, so she’s your fiancee?” Charlie said while thinking of other
things.<br><br>

“Yes. We were supposed to get married on 14 June. Everything
was arranged, the invitations were sent, the rings bought, the dress
was supposed to be delivered tomorrow morning.” He drifted off
into deep thought.<br><br>

“It’s just a delay,” Charles Langelet said politely.<br><br>

“Who knows where we’ll be tomorrow, Monsieur? Obviously, I
shouldn’t complain. At my age I should have been in the army but
with my arm ... yes, an accident at school ... but I think that in this
war civilians are facing more dangers than the soldiers. They say that
certain towns ... “ he lowered his voice “ ... are in ashes and piled high
with bodies and there are mass graves. And I’ve heard some horrifying
stories. You know that they’ve let everyone out of the prisons and
insane asylums? Yes, they have, Monsieur. Our leaders have lost their
minds. Prisoners are running loose without wardens. I heard that the
director of one of these prisons was murdered by the inmates he was
ordered to evacuate; it happened right near here. I’ve seen it with my
own eyes: private houses turned upside down, pillaged. And they attack
people who are travelling, they steal from people in cars ... “<br><br>

“Oh! They steal from ... “<br><br>

“We’ll never know everything that happened during the exodus.
Now they’re saying, ‘You should have stayed at home!’ That’s nice of
them. So we could get massacred in our own homes by the artillery
and planes. I’d rented a small house in Montfort-l’Amaury to have a
lovely month after our wedding, before going back to my in-laws. It
was destroyed on 3 June, Monsieur,” he said indignantly.<br><br>

He talked a lot and feverishly; he looked exhausted. He touched
his fiancee’s cheek tenderly as she slept. “I just want to save
Solange!”<br><br>

“You’re both very young, aren’t you?”<br><br>

“I’m twenty-two and Solange is twenty.”<br><br>

“She’s not very comfortable like that,” Charles Langelet said <b>[p.119]</b> 
suddenly, sweetly, in a voice even he himself didn’t recognise, as sweet as
sugar, while his heart beat harder and faster. “Why don’t you both go
and stretch out on the grass, over there?”<br><br>

“What about the car?”<br><br>

“Oh, I’ll watch the car! Don’t worry,” Charlie said, trying not to
laugh.<br><br>

The young man still hesitated. “I want to leave as early as possible.
And I sleep so soundly ... “<br><br>

“But I’ll wake you up. What time do you want to leave? Look, it’s
nearly midnight,” he said, consulting his watch. “I’ll call you at four
o’clock.”<br><br>

“Oh, Monsieur! You are too kind!”<br><br>

“Not at all. When I was twenty-two, I was also in love ... “<br><br>

The young man made a confused gesture. “We were supposed to
get married on 14 June,” he repeated, sighing.<br><br>

“Yes, of course, of course ... we’re living through terrible
times ... but I assure you, it’s ridiculous to stay cramped in your car.
Your fiancee is all bent up. Do you have a blanket?”<br><br>

“My fiancee has a big travelling coat.”<br><br>

“It’s so nice on the grass. If I didn’t have to worry about my
rheumatism ... Oh, you’re so lucky to be a young man of twenty!”<br><br>

The fiance corrected him: “Twenty-two.”<br><br>

“You will see better times, you will always find a way out, you
will, while a poor old gentleman like me ... “ He lowered his eyes,
like a cat when it purrs. Then he stretched out his hand towards a
moonlit clearing just visible between the trees. “It must be so nice
over there ... you could forget everything.” He waited, then whispered
in a falsely nonchalant tone of voice, “Can you hear that
nightingale?”<br><br>

The bird had been singing for some time, perched high on a
branch, indifferent to the noise, the refugees complaining, the large 
fires they had lit on the grass to chase away the damp. The bird sang
and other nightingales in the countryside answered his song. The
young man listened to the bird, tilting his head, and he put his arm
round his sleeping fiancee. A few moments later he whispered something
in her ear. She opened her eyes. He whispered to her again, <b>[p.120]</b> 
closer, urging her. Charlie turned aaway. Nevertheless, he could hear
certain words: “Since this gentleman said he’d watch the car ...” And:
“You don’t love me, Solange, no, you don’t ... And yet you ... “<br><br>

Charlie yawned loudly, obviously, and, addressing no one in particular
with the exaggerated ease of a bad actor, said, “I think I’ll go
to sleep now ... “<br><br>

Solange stopped hesitating. She giggled nervously, pushing her fiance
away only to give in and kiss him, saying, “If Mummy could see
us now! Oh, Bob, you’re terrible ... you won’t hold it against me afterwards,
will you, Bob?”<br><br>

She walked away with her fiance’s arm around her. Charlie saw
them beneath the trees, holding each other and exchanging little
kisses. Then they disappeared from sight.<br><br>

He waited. The half-hour that followed seemed the longest of his
life. But he was determined. He felt both anguish and extraordinary
pleasure at the same time. His heart beat so violently, so painfully that
he muttered, “This heart of mine ... can’t take it!”<br><br>

But he knew he had never felt such exquisite pleasure. A cat who
sleeps on velvet cushions and is fed on chicken breasts and suddenly
finds himself in the middle of the countryside, on the dry branch of a
tree wet with dew, sinking his teeth into a trembling, bleeding bird,
must feel the same terror, the same cruel joy, he thought, for he was
too intelligent not to understand what was happening to him. Quietly,
ever so quietly, taking great care not to make any noise with the
doors, he climbed into the car next to his, untied the petrol cans (he
also took some oil), cut his hands getting the cap off his tank, poured
in the petrol and, taking advantage of a moment when several other
cars started their motors, drove off.<br><br>

Once out of the forest, he turned round, smiled up at the trees, silvery
green beneath the moon, and thought, “They will indeed have
been married on 14 June after all ... “<br><br>


<b>[p.121]</b> 


<h2>23</h2><br><br>

The uproar in the streets woke the elder Monsieur Pericand. He
opened one pale eye, just one, in confusion and reproach. “What on
earth are they shouting about?” he thought. He had forgotten the
journey, the Germans, the war. He thought he was at his son’s home
in Boulevard Delessert, even though he was staring at a strange
room; he didn’t understand a thing. He was at an age when the past
was more real than the present; he pictured the green cover on his bed
in Paris. He stretched his shaking fingers towards the bedside table
where, every morning, some attentive person would put out a tray
with porridge and his special biscuits. There was no tray, no bowl,
not even a table. It was then that he heard the fire roaring in the
neighbouring houses, smelled the smoke and guessed what was happening.
He opened his mouth, gasped silently, like a fish out of water,
and fainted.<br><br>

Yet the house hadn’t burned to the ground. Only a part of the roof
had been destroyed. After a great deal of panic and chaos, the flames
died down. Amid the wreckage, the fire smouldered and sizzled quietly,
but the house was intact and towards evening they discovered
the elder Monsieur Pericand, alone in his bed. He was muttering,
confused. He calmly let them take him to the nursing home.<br><br>

“He’ll be better off there. I’ve got no time to take care of him.
Imagine the idea,” said the owner, “what with the refugees, the
Germans about to march in and the fire and all ... “<br><br>

But she said nothing about what was worrying her most: her husband
and two sons, gone, all three called up and missing ... All three
away in that vaguely defined, ever-changing, terrifyingly imminent
place called “the war” ...<br><br>

The nursing home was very clean, very well looked after by the
Sisters of the Sacred Sacrament. They put Monsieur Pericand in a <b>[p.122]</b> 
bed next to a window; he would be able to see the tall green June trees
outside and the fifteen old people around him, silent and calm in their
white sheets. But he saw nothing. He thought he was still at home.
Now and again he seemed to talk to his weak purplish hands, folded
on top of the grey blanket. He would utter a few harsh, broken words
to them, then slowly shake his head and, out of breath, close his eyes.
The flames hadn’t touched him, he hadn’t been wounded, but he had
a very high fever. The doctor was in the next village, tending to the
victims of the bombing. Late that evening he was finally able to examine
Monsieur Pericand. He didn’t say much: he was staggering
with exhaustion, he had cared for sixty wounded and hadn’t slept in
forty-eight hours. He gave him an injection and promised to come
back the next day. To the Sisters there was no question: they had
enough experience with the dying to recognise death by a sigh, a
whimper, drops of cold sweat, motionless fingers. They sent someone
to get the priest who had been with the doctor in town and hadn’t
slept either. He gave Monsieur Pericand the last rites and the old man
seemed to come round. As he left, the priest told the Sisters that the
poor old gentleman had made his peace with God and would die a
very Christian death.<br><br>

One of the Sisters was small and thin, with deep blue mischievous
eyes that sparkled with courage from beneath her white wimple; the
other was sweet and shy, with red cheeks and a terrible toothache,
which caused her to bring her hand to her painful gums now and
again, in the middle of saying her rosary, smiling humbly as if she
were ashamed that the cross she had to bear was so light during these
terrible times. It was to her that Monsieur Pericand suddenly said (it
was just after midnight and the commotion of the day had died down;
now all you could hear were the cats howling in the convent garden),
“Daughter, I’m not well ... Go and get the notary.”<br><br>

He thought she was his daughter-in-law. In his delirium, he was
very surprised that she had put on a wimple to nurse him, but nevertheless
it could only be her. He repeated quietly, patiently, “Monsieur
N ogaret ... notary ... last Will ... “<br><br>

“What should we do?” said Sister Marie of the Sacred Sacrament
to Sister Marie of the Cherubins.<br><br>

<b>[p.123]</b> <br><br>

The two white wimples tilted towards each other, almost meeting
above Monsieur Pericand in his bed.<br><br>

“The notary won’t come out at this hour, my poor dear ... Go to
sleep ... There’ll be time enough tomorrow.”<br><br>

“No ... no time ... “ the quiet voice said. “Monsieur Nogaret will
come ... telephone him, please.”<br><br>

Once again the nuns conferred and one of them disappeared, then
came back carrying some hot herbal tea. He tried to take a few sips
but spat it out immediately; it ran down his white beard. Suddenly he
became extremely agitated; he was groaning, shouting orders: “Tell
him to hurry ... he promised ... as soon as I called ... please ...
hurry, Jeanne!” (He no longer thought he was talking to his daughterin-
law but to his wife, who had been dead for forty years.)<br><br>

A particularly sharp pain from her bad tooth prevented Sister
Marie of the Sacred Sacrament from protesting. She nodded-”Yes,
all right”-but remained where she was, dabbing her cheek with her
handkerchief.<br><br>

Her friend stood up decisively. “We have to get the notary, Sister.”<br><br>

She was passionate, with a natural fighting spirit, and her forced
inactivity was frustrating. She had wanted to go to the town with the
doctor and priest but couldn’t leave the fifteen old people at the nursing
home (she didn’t have much faith in the leadership qualities of
Sister Marie of the Sacred Sacrament). When the fire had started she
had trembled beneath her wimple. Nevertheless, she had managed to
roll the fifteen beds out of the room and prepare ladders, ropes and
buckets of water. The fire had not reached the nursing home, which
was two kilometres away from the bombed church, but she had
waited, flinching at the screams from the frightened crowd, the smell
of smoke, the sight of flames-fixed to her post and ready for anything.
But nothing happened. The disaster victims were treated at the
hospital; there was nothing to do but make soup for the fifteen old
people. Until the sudden arrival of Monsieur Pericand galvanised her
once more. “We have to go.”<br><br>

“Do you think so, Sister?”<br><br>

“He might have some important last wishes to set down.”<br><br>

“But what if Maitre Charboeuf isn’t at home?”<br><br>

<b>[p.124]</b> 

Sister Marie of the Cherubins shrugged her shoulders. “At half
past midnight?”<br><br>

“He won’t want to come.”<br><br>

“That will be the day!” the young nun said indignantly. “It’s his
duty to come. I’ll pull him out of bed myself if I have to.”<br><br>

She went out, but hesitated on the doorstep. The religious community-
which consisted of four nuns, two of whom had gone into
retreat at the convent of Paray-le-Monial at the beginning of June
and still hadn’t been able to return--owned a single bicycle. Up until
now, none of the Sisters had dared use it, afraid of causing a scandal
in the village. Sister Marie of the Cherubins herself had said, “We
must wait until the Good Lord Himself provides an emergency. For
example, a sick person is dying and we have to get the doctor and the
priest. Every second is precious, I jump on my bicycle, no one would
dare say a word! And the next time I do it they won’t even notice ... “
They hadn’t yet had an emergency, but Sister Marie of the Cherubins
was longing to ride that bicycle! Five years ago, before she became a
nun, she’d had so many happy outings with her sisters, so many
races, so many picnics. She threw back her black veil, said to herself,
“It’s now or never,” and, her heart pounding with joy, grabbed the
handlebars.<br><br>

Within a few minutes she was in the village. She had some difficulty
waking Maitre Charboeuf, who was a sound sleeper, and even
more trouble persuading him he had to come to the nursing home
right away. Maitre Charboeuf, whom the local girls called “Big
Baby” because of his chubby pink cheeks and full lips, had an easygoing
nature and a wife who terrified him. He got dressed, sighing, and
headed for the nursing home. He found Monsieur Pericand wide
awake, very red and burning with fever.<br><br>

“Here’s the notary,” the nun said.<br><br>

“Sit down, sit down,” said the old man. “There’s no time to lose.”<br><br>

The notary asked the nursing home’s gardener and three sons to
act as witnesses. Seeing that Monsieur Pericand was in a hurry, he
took some paper out of his pocket and prepared to start writing.<br><br>

“I’m ready, Monsieur. If you would, please first tell me your surname,
Christian names and title.”<br><br>

“You’re not Nogaret?”<br><br>

<b>[p.125]</b> <br><br>

Pericand came back to his senses. He glanced at the nursing
home’s walls, at the plaster statue of St. Joseph opposite his bed, at
the two amazing roses Sister Marie of the Cherubins had picked from
the window box and put into a slim blue vase. He tried to work out
where he was and why he was alone, but gave up. He was dying,
there it was, and he wished to have a proper death. This final act, this
death, this Will, how many times had he imagined them, the final
brilliant performance of a Pericand-Maltete on this earth. For ten
years he had been nothing more than a pitiful old man who needed
someone else to dress him and wipe his nose, and now suddenly he
could reclaim his rightful place! To punish, reward, disappoint, de.:.
light, distribute his worldly goods according to his own wishes. To
control everyone. To influence everyone. To come first. (Afterwards,
there would be a ceremony in which he would indeed come first, in a
black coffin, on a raised platform, with flowers, but he would be there
only symbolically or as a winged spirit, while here, once more, he
was alive ... )<br><br>

“What is your name?” he asked quietly.<br><br>

“Maitre Charboeuf,” the notary said unassumingly.<br><br>

“All right, it doesn’t matter. Let’s get on with it.”<br><br>

He began dictating slowly, with difficulty, as if he were reading
sentences written for himself and visible only to him.<br><br>

“Before Maitre Charboeuf ... notary at ... and in the presence
of ... “ mumbled the notary, “Monsieur Pericand in person ... “<br><br>

Monsieur Pericand made a feeble attempt at saying his name
louder, to emphasise its importance, but had to pause for breath,
making it impossible for him to enunciate the prestigious syllables individually.
His purple hands fluttered for a moment over the sheets,
like puppets: he thought he was writing thick black marks on white
paper, as he had in the past, when he signed cards, bonds, sales documents,
contracts: Pericand ... Pe-ri-cand, Louis-Auguste.<br><br>

“Residing at?”<br><br>

“I8 Boulevard Delessert, Paris.”<br><br>

“In ill health, but sound of mind, he comes before the notary and’
witnesses,” said Charboeuf, glancing up at the sick man and looking
doubtful.<br><br>

He was overwhelmed by this dying man. He was fairly experienced; <b>[p.126]</b> 
his clients were mainly local farmers, hut all rich men make their wills
the same way. This was a rich man, there was no doubt about it. Even
though he was wearing one of the nursing home’s coarse nightshirts,
it was clear he was someone important. To be of service like this to
him on his deathbed-Maitre Charboeuf felt honoured. “Do you
wish, Monsieur, to name your son as sole beneficiary?”<br><br>

“Yes, I bequeath all my worldly goods and possessions to Adrien
Pericand, with instructions for him to deposit immediately and without
delay five million to the charitable institution I founded, known
as the Penitent Children of the 16th Arrondissement. This institution
is instructed to commission an excellent artist to paint a life-size portrait
of me on my deathbed, or to sculpt a bust that is a good likeness
of me, and to place it in the entrance hall of the aforementioned establishment.
To my dearly beloved sister Adele-Emilienne-Louise, to
compensate her for the feud caused by the inheritance left me by our
venerable mother, Henriette Maltete, I do bequeath as hers and hers
alone the property I own in Dunkerque bought in 1912 with all its existing
buildings and that portion of the docks which also belongs to
me. I entrust my son with the responsibility of carrying out this wish.
I desire that my chateau in Bleoville, in the Vorhange region in
Calvados, be turned into a home for former soldiers severely wounded
in the war, preferably for those who have been paralysed or have
suffered mental breakdowns. I desire that a simple plaque be displayed
on the wall inscribed with the words ‘Pericand-Maltete Charitable
Institution, in memory of his two sons killed in Champagne.’
When the war is over ... “<br><br>

“I think ... I think it is over,” Maitre Charboeuf shyly interjected.<br><br>

But he didn’t realise that Monsieur Pericand was thinking about
the last war, the one that had taken two sons from him and tripled his
fortune. He was back in September 1918, just after their victory, when
he had nearly died of a bout of pneumonia and when, in the presence
of his family gathered at his bedside (all the relatives from the north
and south had rushed to be there when they heard the news), he had
performed what turned out to be a rehearsal of his death: he had dictated
his last wishes then and they had remained intact within him
until now, when he could give them life.<br><br>

<b>[p.127]</b> <br><br>

“When the war is over, I wish a monument to be built to honour
the dead for which I bequeath the sum of three thousand francs to
be taken from my estate and to be erected on the town square in
Bleoville. At the top, in large gold letters, the names of my two oldest
sons, then a space, then ... “ he closed his eyes, exhausted, “ ... then
all the other names in small letters ... “<br><br>

He was silent for such a long time that the notary looked anxiously
at the Sisters. Was he ... ? Was it all over already? But Sister Marie of
the Cherubins calmly shook her head. He wasn’t dead yet. He was
thinking. In his motionless body, his memory was travelling through
immense spans of time and space: “Almost all of my fortune is tied
up in American stocks and bonds, which I was advised would be a
good investment. I don’t believe it any more.” He shook his beard
mournfully. “I don’t believe it any more. I wish my son to convert
them immediately into French francs. There is also some gold, but
it’s not worth keeping. It should be sold. A copy of my portrait
should also be placed in the chateau in Bleoville in the downstairs
ballroom. I bequeath to my faithful valet an annual income of one
thousand francs for the rest of his life. As for my future greatgrandchildren,
I wish their parents to name the boys Louis-Auguste
and the girls Louise-Augustine after me.”<br><br>

“Is that everything?” Maitre Charboeuf asked.<br><br>

He bowed his long beard, indicating yes, that was everything. For
a few moments that seemed brief to the notary, the witnesses and the
Sisters, but to him were as long as a century, as long as delirium, as
long as a dream, Monsieur Pericand-Maltete moved back in time to
recall the life he had been given on this earth: the family dinners, the
Boulevard Delessert, naps in the drawing room, Albert the cat on his
lap; the last time he saw his older brother when they had parted vowing
never to have anything more to do with each other (and he had
secretly bought back the shares in that deal). Jeanne, his wife in
Bleoville, hunched up with rheumatism, lying on a cane chaise
longue in the garden, holding a paper fan (she died a week later), and
Jeanne, in Bleoville, thirty-five years earlier, just after their wedding,
when some bees had come in through the open window and were
gathering pollen from the lilies in her bridal bouquet and the garland <b>[p.128]</b> 
of orange blossom thrown at the foot of the bed. Jeanne had rushed
into his arms, laughing, so he could protect her ...<br><br>

Then he was certain he could feel death approaching. He made a
startled little gesture (as if he was trying to get through a door that
was too narrow for him, saying, “No, please, after you”) and a look
of surprise appeared on his face. “Is this what it is?” he seemed to say.
“So this is death, then?” The surprise on his face faded and he looked
stern, solemn.<br><br>

Maitre Charboeuf wrote very quickly, “. . . When the Testator
was handed the pen to affix his signature to this Last Will and
Testament, he tried to lift his head, but could not, and immediately
breathed his last, in the presence of the notary and the witnesses, who
nevertheless, after reading the document, signed their names to render
the document legal.”<br><br>

<b>[p.129]</b> <br><br>

<h2>24</h2><br><br>

Jean-Marie, meanwhile, was starting to come round. He had drifted
in and out of sleep for four days, semi-conscious and feverish. It was
only today he felt a bit stronger. A doctor had been able to come the
night before to change the dressing; his temperature had dropped.
From where he was lying on the bed, he could see a large, dark
kitchen, the white hat on an old woman who was sitting in the corner,
beautifully shiny pots on the wall and a calendar depicting a chubbycheeked
French soldier hugging two young women from Alsace, a
souvenir of the previous war. It was strange to see how the memories
of the last war were still so alive in this house. Four pictures of men
in uniform had pride of place: a small tricolour ribbon and a crepe
rosetta were pinned up in a corner; and next to him, to keep him from
getting bored during the long hours of his convalescence, was a collection
of the 1914-18 editions of <i>L’Illustration</i> bound in green and
black.<br><br>

He kept overhearing the same phrases in the conversations around
him: “Verdun, Charleroi, the Marne ... ,” “During the other
war ... ,” “When I was part of the occupying forces in Mulhouse ... “
They hardly spoke about the present war, their defeat. It was something
they couldn’t quite believe yet. Something that would only become
a living, horrible reality a few months later, perhaps a few years
later, perhaps not until these little boys with dirty faces that JeanMarie
could see peering over the wooden gate in front of the door
grew into men. Wearing torn straw hats, their cheeks rosy or darkskinned,
holding long green sticks, frightened, curious, they stood on
tip-toes to make themselves tall enough to see the wounded soldier
inside, and when Jean-Marie moved they disappeared, like frogs
jumping into the water. Sometimes the open gate let in a chicken, a <b>[p.130]</b> 
ferocious old dog, an enormous turkey. Jean-Marie only saw his hosts
at mealtimes. During the day, the old woman in the white hat tended
to him. In the evening, two young women would sit with him. One
was called Cecile, the other Madeleine. For a long time he thought
they were sisters. But no. Cecile was the farmer’s daughter and
Madeleine was a foster-child. Both of them were attractive, not beautiful
but fresh-faced. Cecile had a round red face and lively brown
eyes; Madeleine was more delicate, a blonde with bright cheeks,
smooth as satin and pink as apple blossom.<br><br>

From the young women he learned what had happened that week.
As they spoke about it, in their slightly harsh accent, all those terribly
serious events lost their tragic element. “It’s really sad,” they would
say, and “It’s not very nice to see things like that” ... “Oh, Monsieur!
It’s really upsetting!” He wondered if all the people here spoke like
them, or whether it was something much deeper, rooted in the very
souls of these girls, in their youth, some instinct that told them that
wars end and invaders leave, that even when distorted, even when
mutilated, life goes on. His own mother, knitting while the soup was
cooking, would sigh and say, “Nineteen-fourteen? That’s the year
your father and I got married. We were miserable by the end of it, but
very happy at the beginning.” Even that bleak year was sweetened,
bathed in the reflection of their love.<br><br>

In the same way, he thought, the summer of 1940 would remain in
the memories of these young women as the summer they were
twenty, in spite of everything. He didn’t want to think; thinking was
worse than physical pain, but everything flooded back, everything
went round and round in his head endlessly: being called back from
leave on I 5 May, those four days in Angers, no trains running any
more, soldiers lying on wooden boards, being bitten by insects, then
the air raids, the bombings, the battle of Rethel, the retreat, the battle
of the Somme, another retreat, days when they had fled from city to
city, without officers, without orders, without weapons, and finally
the train compartment in flames. He tossed and turned, groaning. He
didn’t know if the fighting was real, or if it was all a confusing dream
born of his thirst and high fever. Come on, it wasn’t possible ...
There are some things that just aren’t possible ... Hadn’t someone <b>[p.131]</b> 
said something about Sedan? That was in 1870. He could picture
it still: it was at the top of the page, in the history book with the reddish
cloth cover. It was . . . He quietly pronounced the words:
“Sedan, the defeat at Sedan ... the disastrous battle of Sedan decided
the outcome of the war ... “ On the wall above him the image on the
calender, the smiling rosy-cheeked soldier with the two women
from Alsace who were showing off their white stockings . . . Yes,
all that was a dream, the past and he . . . he started trembling and
said, “Thank you, it’s nothing, thank you, please don’t trouble yourself
... “while they slipped a hot-water bottle under his heavy, stiff
legs.<br><br>

“You seem better tonight.”<br><br>

“I feel better,” he replied.<br><br>

He asked for a mirror and smiled when he saw the black beard on
his chin.<br><br>

“I’ll have to shave tomorrow ... “<br><br>

“If you’re strong enough. Who do you want to look handsome
for?”<br><br>

“For you.”<br><br>

They laughed and moved closer. They were curious to know
where he came from, where he’d been wounded. Now and again,
feeling guilty, they would stop talking. “Oh, but you mustn’t let us
chatter on ... you’ll get tired ... then we’ll start arguing, we will ...
It’s Michaud, your name? ... Jean-Marie?”<br><br>

“Yes.”<br><br>

“Are you from Paris? What do you do? Are you a worker? Of
course not! I can tell by your hands. You work in business or maybe
in the government?”<br><br>

“Just a student.”<br><br>

“Oh! You study? Why?”<br><br>

“My goodness,” he said after thinking a moment, “I wonder why
myself sometimes!”<br><br>

It was funny . . . he and his friends had worked, sat and passed
exams, earned diplomas, all the time knowing it was pointless, it
wouldn’t do them any good because there would be a war ... Their
future had been mapped out in advance, their careers were made <b>[p.132]</b> 
in heaven, just like they used to say that “marriages were made in
heaven.” ,He had been conceived while his father was home on leave
in 1915. He was born out of the war and (he had always known it)
. war would be his fate. There was nothing morbid in this idea; he
shared it with many boys his age; it was simply logical and reasonable.
But, he said to himself, the worst is over now, and that changes
everything. Once again there is a future. The war is over-terrible,
shameful, but over. And ... there is hope ...<br><br>

“I wanted to write books,” he said shyly, expressing to these country
girls, these strangers, a wish buried deep in his heart that had
barely taken shape in his mind.<br><br>

Then he wanted to know the name of the place, the farm where
he was.<br><br>

“It’s far from everywhere,” said Cecile, “the middle of nowhere.
Oh, it’s not usually much fun, I can tell you. The more we look after
the animals, the more like them we become, right, Madeleine?”<br><br>

“Have you been here a long time, Mademoiselle Madeleine?”<br><br>

“I was three weeks old. Cecile’s mother brought the two of us up
together. We’re sisters, ‘cause we nursed from the same mother.”<br><br>

“I can see you get along well together.”<br><br>

“We don’t always think alike,” said Cecile. “She’d like to become
a nun!”<br><br>

“Sometimes ... “ said Madeleine, smiling.<br><br>

She had a pretty smile, unhurried and a little shy.<br><br>

I wonder where she came from, Jean-Marie thought. Her hands
were red but they were graceful, like her ankles and legs. A fosterchild
... He felt a little curious and a bit sorry for her. He was grateful
to her for the hazy daydreams she inspired in him. They were a
diversion, they prevented him from thinking about himself, about the
war. It was just a shame he felt so weak. It was difficult to laugh, to
joke with them ... and that must be what they were hoping for. In the
countryside, it was commonplace for young girls and boys to tease
one another ... It was their custom, it was what they did. They would
be disappointed and upset if he didn’t laugh with them.<br><br>

He made an effort to smile.<br><br>

“A boy will come along who will make you change your mind, <b>[p.133]</b> 
Mademoiselle Madeleine. Then you won’t want to be a nun any
more!”<br><br>

“It’s true, it comes over me sometimes, it does ... “<br><br>

“When?”<br><br>

“Oh, I don’t know ... on sad days ... “<br><br>

“As for boys, well, there aren’t many around here,” said Cecile. “I
told you we’re in the middle of nowhere. The few there are get taken
by the war. So then what? Oh, it’s really bad luck being a girl!”<br><br>

“Everyone,” said Madeleine, “has some bad luck.” She had sat
down next to the wounded young man, but suddenly she got up.
“Cecile, did you forget! The floor’s not been washed.”<br><br>

“It’s your turn.”<br><br>

“Oh, really! You’ve got some nerve! It’s your turn!”<br><br>

They argued for a few minutes, then did the job together. They
were amazingly skilful and lively. Soon the cool water made the red
flagstones shine. The smell of grass, milk and wild mint drifted in
from the doorway. Jean-Marie rested his cheek on his hand. It was
strange, the contrast between this absolute serenity and the turmoil
within him, for the unbearable din of the last six days had remained in
his ears and it only took a moment of silence for it all to rise up again:
the sound of twisting metal, the dull, slow beating of an iron hammer
on an enormous anvil ... He winced and started sweating all over ...
train compartments being machine-gunned, the crash of collapsing
beams drowning out people’s screams.<br><br>

“Even so,” he said out loud, “I just have to put that out of my
mind, don’t I?”<br><br>

“What’s that? Do you need something?”<br><br>

He didn’t reply. Suddenly he didn’t recognise Cecile and Madeleine.
They shook their heads, dismayed.<br><br>

“It’s his fever getting worse.”<br><br>

“And you made him talk too much!”<br><br>

“Are you having me on! He didn’t say a word. We were the ones
talking the whole time!”<br><br>

“It wore him out.”<br><br>

Madeleine leaned down over him. He saw her pink cheek right
next to his, caught its scent of strawberries and kissed it. She stood <b>[p.134]</b> 
back blushing and laughing, fixing some locks of hair that had fallen
down.<br><br>

“All right, all right now, you scared me ... You’re not as sick as all
that!”<br><br>

“Who on earth is this girl?” he thought. He had kissed her as if he
were bringing a glass of cool water to his lips. He was on fire. His
throat, the inside of his mouth seemed to crack from the heat, dried
out by the intensity of the flames. This bright, soft skin quenched his
thirst. At the same time he felt totally lucid, with the kind of lucidity
that comes from sleeplessness and fever. He had forgotten the names
of these young girls and his own. The mental effort it took to understand
his present condition, in this place he didn’t recognise, was too
difficult for him. He wore himself out trying, but in the meantime his
soul drifted light and ser~ne, like a fish in the water, like a bird blown
along by the wind. He didn’t see himself, Jean-Marie, but someone
else, a nameless soldier, defeated, but refusing to give up hope, a
wounded young man who did not want to die, a desperate man who
refused to despair. “Even so, we have to make it through ... we have
to get away, from this blood, from this mud dragging us down ...
We’re not just going to lie down and die ... Are we, well, are we?
That would be too ridiculous. We have to hang on ... hang on ...
hang on ... “ he muttered, and when he came to, eyes wide open,
clinging to his bolster, sitting up in bed, he gazed at the night with its
full moon, the silent, sweet-smelling night, the sparkling night, so
gentle after the heat of the day and which, for once, the farmhouse
welcomed through its open doors and windows so it could refresh
and bring peace to the suffering man.<br><br>

<h2>25</h2><br><br>

When Father Pericand found himself forced to continue the journey
on foot, the boys filing after him, each carrying a blanket and haversack
and dragging their feet in the dust, he had decided to head away
from the Loire, an area fraught with danger, towards the woods; but
soldiers had already set up camp there and, since planes were bound
to spot them from the air, the danger seemed just as great amid the
trees as on the river banks. And so, leaving the main road, he took a
path covered with stones, virtually a footpath, trusting his instinct to
lead h-im to some isolated house, just as when, in the mountains, he
led his group of skiers towards a refuge hidden by the fog or snowstorm.
It was a beautiful June day, so brilliant and hot that the boys
felt intoxicated. Silent until now and well-behaved, too well-behaved,
they began jostling each other, shouting, and Father Pericand could
hear laughter and snatches of whispered songs. He listened more
closely and, hearing an obscene refrain mumbled behind him, as if
through half-closed lips, he suggested they all sing a song together.
He struck up, energetically enunciating the words, but only a few
voices joined in. After some moments everyone fell silent. He too
walked on without speaking, wondering what this sudden freedom
might awaken within these poor children, what disturbing desires?
What dreams? One of the younger ones stopped suddenly and cried,
“A lizard, oh! A lizard! Look!” In the sunshine, between two rocks,
agile tails appeared, disappeared; they could see their delicate flat
heads; their throats pulsating in and out to a rapid, frightened beat.
The boys watched, entranced. Some of them even knelt down on the
path. The priest waited a few moments, then waved to them to move
on. The children meekly got up, but at that very moment pebbles flew
out of their hands with such dexterity, such surprising speed, that two <b>[p.136]</b> 
of the lizards-the most beautiful, the biggest, their skin a delicate
blue-grey colour-were killed on the spot.
“Why did you do that?” the priest exclaimed, upset.<br><br>

No one replied.<br><br>

“Well, why? What a spineless act!”<br><br>

“But they’re like snakes, they bite,” said a boy with a long pointed
nose and a pale, dazed expression.<br><br>

“Don’t be ridiculous! Lizards are harmless.”<br><br>

“Oh! We didn’t know, Father,” he replied in a sly voice, with a
feigned innocence that didn’t fool the priest.<br><br>

But he knew it was neither the time nor the place to insist; he just
nodded briefly as if he were satisfied with the answer and added,
“Well, now you know.”<br><br>

He organised them into lines to follow him. Until now he had let
them walk as they liked, but he suddenly thought that some of them
might try to run away. They obeyed him so perfectly, so mechanically-
no doubt used to hearing the whistle blow, to standing in line,
to being docile, to enforced silence-that it broke his heart. He
glanced at their faces, which had suddenly became glum and lifelessas
closed as a house when the door is locked, the life within withdrawn,
absent or dead.<br><br>

“We’d better hurry up if we want to find shelter tonight,” he said.
“As soon as I know where we’ll be sleeping and after we eat (you’ll
be getting hungry soon!) we can make a campfire and you can stay
outdoors as long as you like.”<br><br>

He walked among them, talked to them about his young boys from
the Auvergne, about skiing, mountain climbing, trying to interest
them, to get closer to them. All in vain. They didn’t even seem to be
listening; he realised that anything he said to them-encouragement,
reprimands, information-would never sink in, for their souls were
shut off, walled up, secret and silent.<br><br>

“If only I could look after them for longer,” he thought to himself.
But in his heart he knew he didn’t really want to. He only wanted one
thing: to be rid of them as soon as possible, to be relieved of his responsibility
and this feeling of unease he felt weighing down on him.
The duty of love which, until now, he had felt was almost simple, so <b>[p.137]</b> 
great was the Grace of God within him, now seemed almost impossible
to feel. “Even though,” he thought humbly, “it would mean that,
for the first time perhaps, I would really have to try, it would be a true
sacrifice. How weak I am!”<br><br>

He called over one of the younger boys who was always lagging
behind. “Are you tired? Do your shoes hurt?”<br><br>

Yes, he had guessed correctly: the lad’s shoes were too tight and
hurting him. He took his hand to help him, talking to him quietly
and, since the boy was slouching-his shoulders stooped, his back
round-the priest gently placed two fingers round his neck and
pulled him up straight. The young boy didn’t resist. In fact, with a
distant, indifferent look on his face, he leaned his neck against the
hand that held it, and this light, insistent pressure, this strange, ambiguous
caress (or rather this expectation of a caress) made the priest
blush. He took the child by the chin and tried to look into his eyes,
but his eyelids were lowered and he couldn’t see into them.<br><br>

He walked faster, trying to collect himself with an internal dialogue,
as he always did at sad moments. It wasn’t exactly what you’d
call a prayer. Often it wasn’t even a collection of words recognisable
as human speech. It was a kind of intangible meditation from which
he emerged bathed in joy and peace. But both abandoned him today.
The pity he felt was corrupted by a stirring of anxiety and bitterness.
It was only too clear that these poor wretches were lacking Grace:
His Grace. He wanted to be able to shower them with Grace, inundate
their barren hearts with love and faith. It would take but a sigh
from our Crucified Lord, the flutter of a wing from one of His angels
to bring about the miracle, but nevertheless he, Philippe Pericand,
had been chosen by God to soften them, to unlock their souls, to prepare
them to receive God. He suffered because he was incapable of
bringing it about. He had been spared the moments of doubt and the
sudden hardening of the soul that take hold of some believers, abandoning
them, not in the hands of the princes of this world, but in a
terrible darkness halfway between Satan and God.<br><br>

His temptation was different: it was a kind of impatience to be
holy, the desire to gather liberated souls around him, a ripple of urgency
which, once he had opened someone’s heart to God, propelled <b>[p.138]</b> 
him towards other conquests, leaving him forever frustrated, dissatisfied,
disappointed with himself. It wasn’t enough! No, Lord Jesus, it
wasn’t enough! The old heathen who had confessed, taken Communion
in his final hour, the sinful woman who had renounced vice, the
pagan who had wanted to be baptised. Not enough, no, not enough!
He recognised something similar in the way a greedy man hoards his
gold. And yet, no, it wasn’t exactly like that. It reminded him of certain
moments he’d spent at the river when he was a child: the quiver
of joy every time he caught a fish (yet now he didn’t understand how
he could have liked such a cruel game, and even found it difficult to
eat fish; vegetables, dairy products, fresh bread, chestnuts and that
country soup so thick the spoon stands straight up in it all by itself,
these were all he needed to sustain him). But as a child he had been fanatical
about fishing and he remembered his anguish when the sun
began to set on the water, when he had hardly caught any fish and he
knew the day was nearly over. He had been criticised for his excessive
scruples. He himself feared they might not come from God but from
an Other ... Yet never had he felt that anguish as he did today, on this
journey, beneath this sky where lethal planes sparkled, among these
children whose physical bodies were the only thing he could hope to
save ...<br><br>

They had been walking for some time when they saw the first
houses of a village. It was very small, intact, empty: its inhabitants
had fled. However, before leaving, they had firmly secured the doors
and windows; they had taken their dogs with them, carried the rabbits
and chickens. Only a few cats were left behind, sleeping in the sunshine
on garden paths or walking along the low roofs, looking replete
and tranquil. It was the time of year when all the roses were in bloom,
so above every doorway beautiful flowers opened their petals, generously,
happily, inviting the wasps and bumblebees to drink from deep
inside their hearts. This village abandoned by its people, where no
footsteps, no voices could be heard and where all the sounds of the
countryside were absent-the creaking of wheelbarrows, the cooing
of pigeons, the clucking from the poultry yards-this village had become
the kingdom of the birds, the bees and the hornets. Philippe
. thought he had never heard so many vibrant, joyous songs nor seen <b>[p.139]</b> 
so many swarms all around him. Hay, strawberries, blackcurrants, the
little sweet-smelling flowers in the borders, each flower bed, each
lawn, each blade of grass gave off a soft buzzing sound, like a spinning
wheel. All these small plots had been tended with loving care;
all of them had an archway covered with roses, a tunnel where you
could still see the last lilacs of the season, two iron chairs, a bench in
the sunshine. The redcurrants were enormous, transparent and golden.
“What a wonderful dessert they will make for us tonight,” said<br><br>

Philippe. “The birds will have to share with us-we won’t be harming
anyone by picking this fruit. Now, you all have plenty of food in
your backpacks, so we won’t go hungry. But don’t expect to be sleeping
in a bed tonight. I don’t suppose sleeping under the stars for one
night would frighten you, would it? You have good blankets. Let’s
see, what do we need? A meadow, a natural spring. The barns and
stables don’t appeal to you, I bet! Me neither ... It’s so beautiful out.
Come on, eat some fruit to keep you going and follow me, we’ll try
to find a good spot.”<br><br>

He waited a quarter of an hour while the children gorged themselves
on strawberries; he watched them carefully to make sure they
didn’t step on the flowers and vegetables but he didn’t have to intervene,
they were really very good. He didn’t blow the whistle this
time, he just spoke loudly. “Come on, now, leave some for tonight.
Follow me. If you don’t dawdle you won’t have to line up.”<br><br>

Once again they obeyed. They looked at the trees, the sky, the
flowers, without Philippe being able to guess what they were actually
thinking ... What they really liked, he thought, what really touched
their hearts, was not the natural world, but this intoxicating scent of
fresh air and freedom they were breathing in, so new to them.<br><br>

“Do any of you know the countryside?” Philippe asked.<br><br>

“No, Father, no, Sir, no,” they all said, one after the other.
Philippe had already noticed that he would only get a response
from them after a few moments’ silence, as if they were making up a
story, a lie, or as if they didn’t exactly understand what they were
meant to do ... Always the same feeling of dealing with people who
were ... not quite human ... he thought. Out loud he said, “Come
on, let’s get moving.”<br><br>

<b>[p.140]</b> <br><br>

When they left the village, they saw a large, overgrown private
park, a beautifully deep, clear lake and a house up on a hill.<br><br>

The chateau, without a doubt, thought Philippe. He rang the bell
at the gate in the hope of finding someone at home, but the caretaker’s
cottage was locked up and no one answered.<br><br>

“There’s a meadow over there that looks perfect for us,” said
Philippe, pointing towards the banks of the lake. “We must make the
best of it, boys! We’ll cause less damage there than in these beautiful
little gardens; we’ll be better off than on the road and, if there’s a
storm, we could take shelter in those little changing huts ... “<br><br>

The park had only a wire fence round it; they got over it easily.<br><br>

“Don’t forget,” Philippe said, laughing, “that even though I’m
breaking a rule, I still insist you treat this property with the utmost respect;
I don’t want to see a single branch broken, papers left on the
lawn, or any empty tins. Understand? If you behave then I’ll let you
go swimming in the lake tomorrow.”<br><br>

The grass was so high it came up to their knees and they crushed
flowers underfoot. Philippe showed them the flowers associated with
the Virgin, stars with six white petals, and St. Joseph’s flowers, pale
lilac, almost pink.<br><br>

“Can we pick them, Sir?”<br><br>

“Yes. You can pick as many of those as you like. They just need a
bit of sun and rain to grow back again. Now those must have taken a
lot of time and effort,” he said, pointing to the flower beds planted all
around the chateau.<br><br>

One of the boys next to him raised his small square face towards
the large shuttered windows. “There must be some great stuff in
there!”<br><br>

He had spoken quietly but with such muted envy that the priest
was troubled. When he didn’t reply, the boy persisted: “Don’t you
think, Father, there must be some great stuff in there?”<br><br>

“We ain’t never seen a place like that,” said another.<br><br>

“Of course, there must be some very beautiful things inside, furniture,
paintings, statues ... but many of these houses are just ruins
and you would probably be disappointed if you expected to see amazing
things,” Philippe replied cheerfully. “But I suppose you are most <b>[p.141]</b> 
interested in the food. I should tell you that the people from around
here seem to have planned ahead and taken everything away with
them. And since we wouldn’t have the right to help ourselves to anything
that didn’t belong to us in any case, it’s better not to think about
it and just make do with what we have. Now, I’m going to put you
into three groups: the first will find some dead wood, the second will
get some water, the third will lay out the food.”<br><br>

They followed his orders, working quickly and efficiently. They
lit a big fire at the edge of the lake; they ate, they drank, they picked
some wild strawberries. Philippe wanted to organise some games but
the children seemed gloomy and restrained; there was no shouting,
no laughter. The lake no longer shone in the sunlight, just faintly
glimmered, and they could hear frogs croaking on the banks. In the
light of the fire the boys sat motionless, wrapped up in their blankets.<br><br>

“Do you want to go to sleep?”<br><br>

No one answered.<br><br>

“You aren’t cold, are you?”<br><br>

Silence again.<br><br>

They can’t all be asleep, thought the priest. He got up and walked
between the rows. Sometimes he bent down, covered someone up
who was thinner, frailer than the others, with limp hair, ears that
stuck out. Their eyes were closed. They were pretending to be asleep,
or perhaps sleep really had overcome them. Philippe went back to
read his Bible next to the fire. Now and again he raised his eyes to
look at the reflections in the water. These moments of silent meditation
took away all his cares, made up for all his pain. Once again, love
entered his heart like rain falling on dry ground, first drop by drop,
fighting to carve a path through the pebbles, then in a long cascade
straight to his heart.<br><br>

These poor children! One of them was dreaming and letting out a
long plaintive moan. The priest raised his hand in the darkness,
blessed them, murmured a prayer. “Pater amat vos,” he whispered.
He liked to say this to his catechism students when he was urging
them to repent, to be submissive, to pray. “The Father loves you.”
How could he have believed they were lacking divine Grace, these
poor wretches? Might he not perhaps be less loved than them, treated <b>[p.142]</b> 
with less indulgence, less divine affection than the most insignificant,
the most lowly of them? Oh Lord Jesus, forgive me! It was a moment
of pride, a trap set by a demon! What am I? Less than nothing, dust
beneath your dear feet, Lord! Yes, without a doubt, I whom you have
loved, whom you have protected since I was a child, whom you have
led towards you-you have the right to ask anything of me. But
these children ... some will be saved ... the others ... The Saints will
redeem them ... Yes, all is well, all is goodness, all is Grace. Lord
Jesus, forgive me my sorrow!<br><br>

The water gently rippled, the night was peaceful and solemn. This
presence without whom he could not live, this Breath, this watchful
Eye was upon him in the darkness. A child sleeping in the dark,
pressed against his mother’s heart, has no need of light to recognise
her cherished features, her hands, her rings! He even laughed softly
with pleasure. “Jesus, you are here, with me once again. Please remain
by my side, my cherished Friend!” A long pink flame shot up
from a black log. It was late; the moon was rising, but he wasn’t tired.
He took a blanket, stretched out on the grass. There he remained,
eyes wide open, a flower brushing lightly against his cheek. There
wasn’t a single sound in this little corner of the world.<br><br>

He heard nothing, saw nothing, but felt by a kind of sixth sense
two boys silently rushing towards the chateau. It happened so quickly
that at first he thought he was dreaming. He didn’t want to call out for
fear of waking the other sleeping boys. He got up, brushed the grass
and flowers off his cassock and headed for the chateau. The thick
lawn hid the sound of his footsteps. He remembered now he had noticed
one of the shutters had been badly secured and was slightly ajar.
Yes, he was right! The moon lit up the front of the house. One of the
boys was pushing the shutter, forcing it open. Before Philippe could
shout at them to stop, a stone shattered the window and there was a
rain of glass. The boys, as lithe as cats, leapt inside.<br><br>

“Oh, you little brats! Just wait till I sort you out!” Philippe said to
himself.<br><br>

Hoisting up his cassock, he followed them through the window,
and found himself in a drawing room with furniture covered by dustsheets
and a large, cold parquet floor. He groped about in the dark for <b>[p.143]</b> 
a few moments before finding the light switch. When he turned the
lights on he saw no one. He hesitated, looked around (the boys were
hiding or had run off): the sofas, the piano, the winged bergere chairs ·
covered by billowing sheets, the flowered chintz curtains at the
windows-all made good hiding places. Seeing some fabric move, he
walked towards a bay window and yanked back the curtains. One of
the boys was there. He was among the oldest, almost an adult with a
blackish face, rather beautiful eyes, a low forehead and a strong jaw.<br><br>

“What are you doing here?” said the priest.<br><br>

He heard a noise behind him and turned round; another boy was
in the room, standing right behind him; he too was about seventeen
or eighteen. He had thin, contemptuous lips and his yellowish face
looked wild, as if he were possessed. Philippe was on his guard but
they were too fast for him. In a flash they attacked; one tripped him
and knocked him down, the other grabbed his throat. But he managed
to fight them off, silently, successfully. Catching hold of one of
them by the collar, he tightened his grip so much that the boy was
forced to let go. As the boy pulled away, something fell out of his
pocket and rolled along the ground: it was some silver.<br><br>

“Congratulations, you’ve moved fast,” said Philippe, half choking,
sitting on the floor, thinking to himself, “The main thing is not to
make a big thing of it, just get them out of here and they’ll follow me
like little puppies. Then we’ll sort it out tomorrow.”<br><br>

“That’s enough, now! Enough of this nonsense ... get going.”<br><br>

He had barely finished speaking when once again they threw
themselves on him, silently, desperately, savagely; one of them bit
him, drew blood.<br><br>

“They’re going to kill me,” Philippe thought in amazement. They
hung on to him like wolves. He didn’t want to hurt them, but he was .
forced to defend himself; they punched him, kicked him, he fought
them off and they came back at him even more violently than before.
They no longer looked human, they were demented, animals . · .
Philippe would have proven the stronger in spite of everything but
they hit him on the head with a pedestal table with bronze legs; he fell
down and as he fell he heard one of the boys run to the window and
whistle. He saw nothing else: not the twenty-eight teenagers <b>[p.144]</b> 
suddenly waking up, running across the lawn, climbing through the window;
not the rush towards the delicate furniture that was being ripped
apart and thrown out on to the grass. They were frenzied, they
danced around the priest as he lay sprawled on the floor, they sang
and shouted. One of the youngest, with a girlish face, jumped with
both feet on to a sofa whose old springs creaked under the weight.
The older ones had discovered a liquor cabinet. They dragged it into
the drawing room, kicking it to tnove it along; when they opened
it, they saw it was empty but they didn’t need liquor to be drunk: the
carnage was enough for them. They felt a terrifying kind of joy.
Dragging Philippe by the feet, they threw him out of the window, so
he fell heavily on to the lawn. At the edge of the lake, they swung him
like a bundle ... “Heave-ha! Kill him!” they shouted in their harsh,
high-pitched voices, some of which still sounded childlike.<br><br>

When Philippe fell into the water he was still alive. Out of a sense
of self-preservation, or a final burst of courage, he managed to remain
at the edge of the lake; he clutched the branch of a tree with
both hands and tried hard to keep his head above water. His battered
face was red, swollen and grotesque. They were throwing stones at
him. He held on at first, clinging with all his might to the branch that
was swaying, cracking, giving way. He tried to get to the other shore
but he was being bombarded. Finally he raised both arms, put them
in front of his face, and the boys saw him sink straight down, in his
black cassock. He hadn’t drowned: he’d got trapped in the mud. And
that was how he died, in water up to his waist, head thrown back, one
eye gouged out by a stone.<br><br>


<b>[p.145]</b> <br><br>


<h2>26</h2><br><br>

At the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Nimes, a Mass was celebrated
every year for the deceased members of the Pericand-Maltete family.
Since only Madame Pericand’s mother lived in Nimes, this service
was usually a brief affair in one of the side chapels, attended by
the elderly lady herself-half-blind and obese, whose heavy breathing
drowned out the priest’s voice-and a cook who had worked for
the household for thirty years. Madame Pericand had been born a
Craquant, related to the Marseilles branch of the Craquant family
who had made their money in olive oil. This ancestry seemed extremely
respectable to her, of course (and her dowry had been two
million, at its pre-war value), but it paled in comparison with that of
her new relations. Her mother, the elder Madame Craquant, agreed
with this view of things and, having gone to live alone in Nimes, she
observed all the Pericand rituals with gre~t fidelity, praying for the
dead and sending letters of congratulations to the living on the occasion
of marriages and baptisms, just as the colonial English raised
solitary glasses on the day London was celebrating the Queen’s
birthday.<br><br>

This Mass for the deceased was particularly agreeable to Madame
Craquant because she would stop at a tearoom on her way home from
the cathedral and have a cup of hot chocolate and two croissants. As
she was extremely fat, her doctor made her follow a strict diet, but
her early morning rise and the lengthy and, to her, very tiring walk
from the great carved door of the cathedral to her pew allowed her to
devour these fortifying foods without remorse. Sometimes when her
cook, of whom she lived in fear, had her back turned and was standing
rigid and silent near the door of the tearoom-their two prayer
books in her hand, Madame Craquant’s black shawl over her arm <b>[p.146]</b> 
she would even draw a platter of little cakes towards her and, with affected
nonchalance, pop a cream-filled clwux bun into her mouth, or a
cherry tart, or both.<br><br>

Outside, her carriage, drawn by two old horses and driven by a
coachman almost as fat as Madame Craquant herself, waited, flies
buzzing around in the heat.<br><br>

This year, everything was at sixes and sevens. The Pericands, who
had fled to Nlmes after the events of June, had just learned of the
deaths of the old Monsieur Pericand-Maltete and Philippe. News of
the first had been conveyed by the Sisters in the nursing home where
the old gentleman had had, according to Sister Marie of the Sacred
Sacrament’s letter, “a good death, very comforting, very Christian.”
She had even been so kind as to describe in the most minute detail the
contents of his Last Will and Testament, which would be written up
as soon as possible.<br><br>

Madame Pericand read and reread the final sentence of the letter
and sighed, a look of anxiety spreading across her face, only to be
replaced, a moment later, with the expression of contrition a good
Christian feels when she learns that someone she loves has gone to
find peace with the Good Lord. “Your grandfather is with Jesus, children,”
she said.<br><br>

Two hours later, the second blow to strike the family was revealed,
but in less detail. The mayor of a little village in the Loiret informed
them that Father Philippe Pericand had been killed in an accident and
sent them papers that confirmed his identity beyond a doubt. As for
the thirty wards in his care, they had disappeared. Since half of
France was looking for the other half, this surprised no one. There
was mention of a truck which had fallen in the river, not far from
where Philippe had met his death, and his relations remained convinced
that this had something to do with him and his unfortunate orphans.
To cap it all, Madame Pericand was told that Hubert had been
killed at the Battle of Moulins. This time the catastrophe was complete.
The intensity of her sorrow caused her to cry out in proud
despair.<br><br>

“I gave birth to a saint and a hero,” she said. “Our sons are making
sacrifices for other people’s sons.” And she looked darkly at her <b>[p.147]</b> 
cousin Craquant whose only child had managed to get a peaceful little
post in the home guard in Toulouse. “Dear Odette, my heart is
breaking. You know that I lived only for my children, that I was a
mother, nothing but a mother” (Madame Craquant, who had been a
trifle frivolous in her youth, lowered her head), “but I swear to you,
the pride I feel makes me forget my bereavement.”<br><br>

She drew herself up and, already imagining the black veil fluttering
around her, showed her cousin to the door with pride and dignity.<br><br>

“You are a true Catholic.” Odette sighed humbly.<br><br>

“Just a good Frenchwoman,” Madame Pericand replied drily,
turning her back.<br><br>

This conversation had lessened her sorrow slightly. She had always
respected Philippe and in some way understood he was not of
this world. She knew that, if he had renounced his dream of being a
missionary, it was out of humility and that he had chosen to serve
God in the way that was the most difficult for him: by subjecting himself
to the most commonplace duties. She was certain her son was
withJesus. (When she said the same thing about her father-in-law, it
was with a secret doubt for which she reproached herself, but there
it was ... ) But Philippe ... “I can see him as if I were there,” she
thought. Yes, she could be proud of Philippe and the radiance of his
soul reflected back on to her.<br><br>

Whereas when she thought of Hubert she felt a strange turmoil.
Hubert, who failed miserably at school, who bit his nails, Hubert
with his ink-stained fingers, his lovely chubby face, his wide young
mouth, for Hubert to die a hero was ... inconceivable ... When she
talked to her sympathetic friends about how Hubert had left (”I tried
to stop him, but I saw how impossible it was. He was a child, but a
courageous child, and he has given his life for the honour of France.
As Rostand said, ‘It is even more beautiful because it is pointless.’ “),
she found that she was rewriting the past. She actually believed she
had said all these proud words, that she had sent her son off to war.<br><br>

Nimes, which had looked upon her until now rather bitterly, felt a
respect for this sorrowful mother that was almost affectionate.<br><br>

“The whole town will be there today,” old Madame Craquant
sighed with melancholy satisfaction.<br><br>

<b>[p.148]</b> <br><br>

It was 31 July. Their Mass for the Dead was due to be celebrated at
ten o’clock, with three names tragically added.<br><br>

“Oh, Mother, what does it matter?” replied Madame Pericand,
and it was impossible to tell if she was referring to the uselessness of
such consolation or to the very poor opinion she had of her fellow
citizens.<br><br>

The town gleamed beneath the blazing sun. In the poor districts, a
dry and insidious wind rattled the bead curtains in doorways. The
flies bit; you could smell a storm coming. Nimes, normally sleepy at
this time of year, was crowded with people. The refugees who had
poured in were still there, unable to leave because of petrol shortages
and the temporary closure of the border along the Loire. The streets
and town squares had been transformed into parking lots. There was
not a spare room anywhere.<br><br>

People had been sleeping in the streets; the ultimate luxury was
a bale of hay to use as a bed. The citizens of Nimes were proud
of themselves for having done their duty, and more, towards the
refugees. They had welcomed them with open arms, pressed them
against their bosoms. There was not a single family who had not offered
hospitality to these poor people. It was just a shame that this
state of .affairs was dragging on so unreasonably long. There was
also the matter of provisions, and you can’t forget either, said the
townspeople, that all these poor refugees, exhausted by their journey,
would be susceptible to the most terrible epidemics. There were
veiled hints in the press and more open, brutal demands from some
quarters, urging the refugees to leave as soon as possible. But as yet,
circumstances had prevented anyone from going anywhere.<br><br>

Madame Craquant, who had her entire family living with her and
was therefore able, head held high, to refuse to donate even a pair of
sheets, rather enjoyed all this hustle and bustle, which she witnessed
through her half-closed Venetian blinds. She was having her breakfast,
along with the Pericand children, before going to church.
Madame Pericand watched them eat. She did not touch her own food
even though, thanks to the stock of supplies accumulated in her
mother’s enormous cupboards since war had been declared, it was
more appetising than the usual rations. <br><br>

<b>[p.149]</b> <br><br>

Madame Craquant was troubled by her daughter’s cold stare. A
snow-white napkin covering her vast chest, she was polishing off her
third piece of buttered toast when she felt a touch of indigestion. She
put the toast down and looked at her daughter timidly. “I don’t know
why I’m eating, Charlotte,” she said, “it’s not going down well.”<br><br>

“You’ll have to force yourself, Mother,” replied Madame Pericand
ironically, her voice as cold as ice. And she pushed the full jug of hot
chocolate towards the old lady.<br><br>

“All right then. Pour me another half-cup, Charlotte, but not more
than half a cup now!”<br><br>

“You know it’s your third?”<br><br>

But Madame Craquant seemed suddenly struck deaf. “Yes, yes,”
she said vaguely, nodding her head. “You’re right, Charlotte, we
must fortify ourselves before the sad ceremony.” And she drank up
the frothy chocolate with a sigh.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the doorbell rang and one of the servants brought in a
package for Madame Pericand. It contained photographs of Philippe
and Hubert: she had sent them to be framed. She looked at them for a
long time, then got up, put them down on the sideboard, stood back
to see how they looked, went into her bedroom, and came back carrying
two black rosettas and two red, white and blue ribbons. As she
draped them over the picture frames, they heard Nanny sobbing in
the doorway, Emmanuel in her arms. J acqueline and Bernard also
started crying.<br><br>

Madame Pericand took the children by the hand, gently pulled
them from their chairs and walked them over to the sideboard. “Just
look at your two big brothers, my darlings! Ask the Good Lord to
bless you so you might be like them. Try to be as good, as studious
and obedient as they were. They were such good sons,” said Madame
Pericand, her voice choking with pain, “and I wouldn’t be at all surprised
if God has rewarded them by recognising them as martyrs.
You mustn’t cry. They are with the Good Lord; they are looking
down on us, protecting us. They will be waiting for us in heaven, and
in the meantime, here on earth, we must be proud of them, both as
Christians and as citizens of France.”<br><br>

Everyone was crying now; even Madame Craquant had stopped <b>[p.150]</b> 
drinking her hot chocolate and was looking for her handkerchief, her
hands trembling. The photograph of Philippe was amazingly lifelike.
It really captured his pure, intense expression, and he seemed to contemplate
his family with that smile of his that was sweet, kind and
loving.<br><br>

“And when you say your prayers, you mustn’t forget,” Madame
Pericand concluded, “those unfortunate children who died with
him.”<br><br>

“But maybe they aren’t all dead?”<br><br>

“It’s possible,” Madame Pericand said vaguely, “very possible.
Those poor children ... On the other hand,” she added, “that charitable
institution really is a great responsibility,” and her thoughts ran
back to her father-in-law’s Will.<br><br>

Madame Craquant dried her eyes. “Little Hubert ... he was so
sweet, so funny. I remember one day when you were visiting, I’d
fallen asleep in the sitting room after lunch, and that naughty boy
goes and takes down the flypaper from the chandelier and quietly
lowers it on to my head. I woke up and screamed ... You certainly
punished him that day, Charlotte.”<br><br>

“I don’t remember,” said Charlotte drily. “Now, come on, Mother,
finish your hot chocolate; we have to hurry. The carriage is downstairs.
It’s nearly ten o’clock.”<br><br>

They went into the street, the grandmother first, puffing and leaning
on her cane, then Madame Pericand, swathed in black crepe, followed
by her two children in black, Emmanuel in white, and a few of
the servants, all in full mourning attire. The carriage was waiting. The
driver was getting down from his seat to open the door when, suddenly,
Emmanuel pointed a little finger towards the crowd. “Hubert!
Look, it’s Hubert!”<br><br>

Turning automatically to look, Nanny blanched and let out a
strangled cry: “Jesus, Blessed Virgin Mary!”<br><br>

A sort of hoarse howl came from the mouth of Madame Pericand;
she threw back her black veil, took a few steps towards Hubert, then
slipped on the pavement and collapsed into the arms of the driver,
who had rushed forward just in time to catch her.<br><br>

It really was Hubert, a lock of hair in his eyes, skin as pink and
golden as a nectarine, with no bags, no bicycle, no wounds, walking <b>[p.151]</b> 
towards them with a huge grin on his face. “Hello, Mother, hello,
Grandmother. How is everyone?”<br><br>

“Is it you? Is it you? You’re alive!” said Madame Craquant, laughing
and crying at the same time. “Oh, my darling Hubert, I knew you
couldn’t really be dead! Dear God, you’re too mischievous for that!”<br><br>

Madame Pericand came round. “Hubert? Is it really you?” she
stammered weakly.<br><br>

Hubert was both pleased and embarrassed by this welcome. He
took a few steps towards his mother and leaned over so she could kiss
his cheeks (which she did, not knowing exactly what she was doing).
Then he stood in front of her, shifting from one foot to the other just
as he did when he failed Latin translation at school.<br><br>

“Hubert,” she sighed, and threw her arms round his neck, hanging
on to him, showering him with kisses and tears. An emotional little
crowd had gathered around them.<br><br>

Hubert, who had no idea what to do, patted Madame Pericand’s
back, as if something had gone down the wrong way. “Weren’t you
expecting me?”<br><br>

She shook her head.<br><br>

“Were you going out?”<br><br>

“My poor boy! We were going to the cathedral to say a Mass for
your soul!”<br><br>

Hubert was taken aback. “You’re joking!”<br><br>

“But where have you been? What have you been doing these past
two months? We were told you’d been killed in Moulins.”<br><br>

“Well, you can see <i>that</i> wasn’t true since I’m right here.”<br><br>

“But you did go and fight? Hubert, don’t lie to me! Did you really
have to go and do that, you little idiot. And what about your bicycle?
Where’s your bicycle?”<br><br>

“Lost.”<br><br>

“Of course! This boy will be the death of me! Well, come on,
speak, tell us, where were you?”<br><br>

“I was trying to find you.”<br><br>

“You would have been better off not leaving us in the first place,”
said Madame Pericand harshly. Then, her voice breaking with emotion:
“Your father will be so happy when he hears.”<br><br>

She burst into tears and started kissing him again. It was getting <b>[p.152]</b> 
late now. But, even though she wiped her eyes, the tears kept falling.
“Go on, then, go inside and get washed! Are you hungry?”<br><br>

“No, I had a good lunch, thanks.”<br><br>

“Get a clean handkerchief, change your tie, wash your hands,
make yourself decent, for goodness sake! Hurry up, and meet us at
the cathedral.”<br><br>

“What? You’re still going? Since I’m alive, wouldn’t it be better to
go and stuff ourselves at a restaurant instead?”<br><br>

“Hubert!”<br><br>

“What? Is it because I said ‘stuff ourselves’?”<br><br>

“No, but ... “<br><br>

It would be terrible to tell him, like this, in the middle of the street,
she thought. She took his hand and pulled him inside the carriage.
“My darling, there have been two great tragedies. First Grandpa, poor
Grandpa died, and Philippe ... “<br><br>

He took the shock in an odd way. Two months earlier he would
have burst into tears, big fat salty tears rolling down his pink cheeks.
Now he went very pale and his face took on an expression she had
never seen before: manly, almost harsh. “l don’t much mind about
Grandpa,” he said after a long silence. “As for Philippe ... “<br><br>

“Hubert, are you mad?”<br><br>

“No, I don’t much mind and neither do you. He was old and ill.
What would he have done in all this chaos?”<br><br>

“Well, really!” Madame Craquant protested.<br><br>

But he ignored her and continued talking to his mother. “As for
Philippe ... But first, are you really sure? It couldn’t be like what
happened with me?”<br><br>

“We are sure, I’m afraid ... “<br><br>

“Philippe ... “ His voice trembled and broke. “He wasn’t of this
world. Other people talk about heaven all the time but they only
think about this world ... Philippe, he came from God and he must
be very happy now.” He hid his face in his hands and remained motionless
for a long time. Then they heard the cathedral bells ringing.<br><br>

Madame Pericand touched her son’s arm. “Shall we go?”<br><br>

He nodded. They all got into the carriage, the servants following
in another, and made their way to the cathedral. Hubert walked <b>[p.153]</b> 
between his mother and grandmother. They remained on either side of
him as he knelt on his prayer cushion. He had been recognised; he 
could hear whispering, muffled cries. Madame Craquant had not been
wrong: the whole town was there. Everyone had a good view of the
survivor who had come to give thanks to God for his deliverance on
the very day his family had gathered to pray for their dead. On the
whole, everyone was happy: the fact that a good lad like Hubert had
managed to avoid German bullets flattered their sense of justice and
their craving for miracles. All the mothers who had had no news
since May (and there were so many of them!) felt hope beat within
their breast. And it was impossible to feel resentful about it, as they
might have been tempted to do-”Some people have all the luck”when,
sadly, poor Philippe (an excellent priest, absolutely everyone
said so) had died.<br><br>

And so, despite the solemnity of the surroundings, many women
smiled at Hubert. He didn’t see them. His mother’s words had thrust
him into a state of profound shock from which he still hadn’t
emerged. Philippe’s death was tearing him apart. He had returned to
that terrible state of mind he felt when France was falling, before the
desperate and vain battle of Moulins. “If we were all the same,” he
thought, looking over the congregation, “if we were all pigs and
dogs, then it might be understandable. But saints like Philippe, why
are they sent here? If it’s to save us, to make up for our sins, it’s like
offering a pearl in exchange for a bag of stones.”<br><br>

The people around him, his family, his friends, aroused a feeling
of shame and rage within him. He had seen them on the road, them
and people like them: he recalled the cars full of officers running
away with their beautiful yellow trunks and their painted women,
civil servants abandoning their posts, panic-stricken politicians dropping
files of secret papers along the road, young girls, who had diligently
wept the day the armistice was signed, being comforted in the
arms of the Germans. “And to think that no one will know, that there
will be such a conspiracy of lies that all this will be transformed into
yet another glorious page in the history of France. We’ll do everything
we can to find acts of devotion and heroism for the official
records. Good God! To see what I’ve seen! Closed doors where you <b>[p.154]</b> 
knock in vain to get a glass of water and refugees who pillaged
houses; everywhere, everywhere you look, chaos, cowardice, vanity
and ignorance! What a wonderful race we are!”<br><br>

Meanwhile, he was absently following the service, his heart so
heavy and hard that it caused him physical pain. Several times he
sighed gruffly, which worried his mother. She turned towards him,
her eyes shining with tears through her black veil. “Are you in pain?”
she whispered.<br><br>

“No, Mother,” he replied, looking at her so coldly that he reproached
himself for it, but he couldn’t help it.<br><br>

He judged his family with bitterness and a painful harshness. His
grievances whirled around in his mind in the form of brief violent 
images, without him being able to express them clearly: his father
calling the Republic “this decaying regime ... “ but that same
evening, twenty-four places set for dinner at their apartment, with
their most beautiful tablecloths, wonderful foie gras and expensive
‘wines, all in honour of a former minister who might be re-elected and
might therefore be useful to Monsieur Pericand (God, his mother’s
tight little mouth saying, “Oh, my dear Minister ... “);their cars full
to bursting with fine linen and silver caught up among the refugees,
and his mother, pointing to women and children forced to walk with
just a few bits of clothing wrapped up in a piece of cloth, saying, “Do
you see how good our Lord Jesus is? Just think, we could be those unfortunate
wretches!” Hypocrites, frauds!<br><br>

And what about him? What was he doing here? His heart full of
disgust and hatred, he was just pretending to pray for Philippe. But
Philippe was ... My God! Philippe, my beloved brother! He whispered
these words and, as if they had some divine power to console,
his painful heart relented. Warm tears flooded down his cheeks.
Thoughts of kindness, forgiveness, ran through him. They did not
come from within him but from beyond, as if some friend had leaned
down to whisper in his ear, “A family that produced Philippe can’t be
all bad. You’re being too harsh. You’ve only seen things from the outside,
you can’t look into their souls. Evil is visible, it burns, it smugly
displays itself for all to see. There is only One who can count the sacrifices,
who can measure all the blood and tears.”<br><br>

<b>[p.155]</b> <br><br>

He looked at the marble plaque engraved with the names of those
who had died in the war ... the last war. Among them were some
Craquants and Pericands-uncles, cousins he’d never known, children
barely older than he, killed at the Somme, Flanders, Verdun,
killed twice since they had died in vain. Little by little, out of this
chaos of contradictory feelings, was born a strange, bitter feeling of
peace. He had gained valuable experience, knowledge; no longer in
an abstract, bookish way, but in his heart, which had beat so wildly, in
his hands which had been torn to shreds trying to defend the bridge at
Moulins, in his lips which had kissed a woman while the Germans celebrated
their victory. Danger, courage, fear, love: now he knew the
real meaning of these words ... Yes, even love ... He felt better now,
stronger, and very confident. He would never see the world through
anyone else’s eyes again. But more than that, anything he might love
and believe from now on would come from himself, and no one else.
Slowly, he put his hands together, lowered his head and, finally,
prayed.<br><br>

The Mass was over. Outside the cathedral he was surrounded by
people wanting to kiss him and congratulate his mother.<br><br>

“And he still has those lovely cheeks,” the women all said, “after
all he’s been through ... He’s hardly lost any weight, he hasn’t
changed at all. Dear little Hubert ... “<br><br>


<b>[p.156]</b> <br><br>

<h2>27</h2><br><br>

Gabriel Corte and Florence arrived at the Grand Hotel at seven
o’clock in the morning. Collapsing with exhaustion, they looked
around fearfully, as if they expected, once through the revolving
doors, to plunge back into the nightmare of an incoherent world,
with refugees sleeping on the cream carpets of the writing rooml a
hotel manager who didn’t recognise them and refused to give them a
room, no hot water for a bath and bombs falling in the lobby. But,
thank God, this Queen of French spas had remained intact and the
feverish, noisy activity at the lake was simply the way it always was.
All the staff were in place. Despite the manager’s insistence that they
were short of everything, the coffee was delicious, the cocktails were
mixed with crushed ice and the taps poured out as much water as you
liked, cold and boiling hot. At first everyone had been worried: the
unfriendly attitude of England made them fear that the blockade
would remain in place, thus depriving them of fresh supplies of
whisky, but they had a large quantity in stock. They could wait.<br><br>

As soon as they set foot on the marble floor of the lobby, Gabriel
and Florence felt they had been reborn. Everything was calm. You
could barely hear the distant whirring of the great lifts. Through
the open bay windows, misty, shimmering rainbows created by the
hotel’s water sprinklers hovered over the lawns. They were recognised
and surrounded. The manager of the Grand Hotel, where they
had stayed every year for twenty years, raised his arms to heaven and
told them it was all over; they had glimpsed the bottom of the abyss,
but now they had to try to restore some sense of duty and nobility in
the people. Then he confided in them that they were expecting members
of the government to arrive at any moment (their suites had
been reserved the previous day), and that the ambassador of Bolivia <b>[p.157]</b> 
was having to sleep on a billiard table. However, for him, Gabriel
Corte, he would always manage to find something (more or less the
same words he had used as a newly promoted deputy manager of the
Normandy Hotel in Deauville at the height of the racing season).<br><br>

Corte wearily passed his hand over his painful forehead. “My
good man, you could put a mattress in the lavatory if you had to!”<br><br>

All around him, everything was taking place in an appropriately
discreet manner. There were no more women giving birth in a ditch,
no more lost children, no more bridges blown up with such illcalculated
amounts of dynamite that they demolished the houses
nearby. Here, windows were politely closed to keep out draughts,
doors were opened for him, he felt plush carpets beneath his feet.<br><br>

“Do you have all your luggage? You didn’t lose anything? What
luck! People have been arriving without pyjamas, without even a
toothbrush. There was one unfortunate gentleman who arrived with
no clothes on. He was wounded in an explosion and made the entire
journey from Tours completely naked, with only a blanket round
him.”<br><br>

“Well, I nearly lost my manuscripts,” said Corte.<br><br>

“Good gracious, how awful! But you found them intact? All the
same, what you must have been through! What you must have been
through! Excuse me, Monsieur, excuse me, Madame, right this way.
Here is the suite I have given you; it’s on the fourth floor, I do apologise;
you will excuse me, won’t you?”<br><br>

“Oh,” muttered Corte, “nothing matters at the moment.”<br><br>

“I do understand,” said the manager, lowering his head and looking
saddened. “Such a tragedy ... I was born in Switzerland but I am
French at heart. I do understand.”<br><br>

And he stood motionless for a few moments, his head down like a
mourner at a funeral who wants to rush to the exit, but feels obliged
to pay his respects to the family. He had put on this expression so
often in the past few days that his kindly, chubby face had been transformed.
He had always walked and spoken softly, as befitted his profession.
Now he exaggerated his natural tendencies even further,
crossing the room utterly silently, as if he were in a funeral parlour,
and when he said to Corte, “Shall I have breakfast sent up?” it was in <b>[p.158]</b> 
a discreet and mournful tone of voice, as if he were looking at the
body of a cherished relative and asking, “May I kiss him one last
time?”<br><br>

“Breakfast?” Corte sighed, returning with difficulty to reality and
the trivial problems of everyday life. “I haven’t eaten in twenty-four
hours,” he added with a faint smile.<br><br>

That had been true the day before, but not this morning: at six
o’clock he had eaten a hearty meal. Nevertheless, he wasn’t lying: he
had eaten absent-mindedly because of his extreme exhaustion and the
concern he felt at the tragedy taking place in France. He felt as
though he hadn’t eaten.<br><br>

“Oh, but you must force yourself, Monsieur! I don’t like seeing
you like this, Monsieur Corte. You mustn’t give in. You owe it to
mankind.”<br><br>

Corte nodded in resignation; he didn’t dispute his obligation to
mankind, but at the moment he couldn’t be expected to have more
courage than the most humble citizen. “My good man,” he said, turning
away to hide his tears, “it is not just France who is dying, it is Art
as well.”<br><br>

“Not as long as you are here, Monsieur Corte,” the manager
replied warmly, as he had a great number of times since the Fall of
France. Corte was, in the list of celebrities, the fourteenth to arrive
from Paris since the sad events began and th~ fifth writer to seek
refuge at the luxury hotel.<br><br>

Corte smiled weakly and asked him to make sure the coffee was
very hot.<br><br>

“Boiling hot,” the manager assured him, then gave the necessary
orders over the telephone and left.<br><br>

Florence had gone into her room, locked the door and anxiously
looked at herself in the mirror. Her face, normally so soft, so well
made-up, so rested, was covered in a shiny coat of sweat; it no longer
absorbed the powder and foundation, but turned them into thick
lumps, like curdled mayonnaise. Her nose was pinched, her eyes
sunken, her mouth pale and limp. She turned away from the mirror in
horror.<br><br>

“I could be fifty,” she said to her maid.<br><br>

<b>[p.159]</b> <br><br>

This was quite literally true, but she said it with such disbelief and
terror that Julie took it as she should: that is to say figuratively, as a
metaphor for expressing extreme old age.<br><br>

“After everything that’s happened it’s understandable ... Madame
should take a little nap.”<br><br>

“It’s impossible ... As soon as I close my eyes I hear the bombs, I
see the bridge again, the dead bodies ... “<br><br>

“Madame will forget.”<br><br>

“Never! Could <i>you</i> forget?<br><br>

“It’s different for me.”<br><br>

“Why?”<br><br>

“Madame has so many other things to think about!” said Julie.
“Shall I lay out Madame’s green dress?”<br><br>

“My green dress? With the way I look?”<br><br>

Florence, who had slumped down into her chair with her eyes
closed, suddenly rallied, summoning all her meagre strength like the
head of an army who, despite needing rest and acknowledging the inefficiency
of his subordinates, pulls himself together and, still weak
with exhaustion, leads his troops on to the battlefield. “Listen, this is
what you are going to do. First, while you are running the bath, prepare
me a face mask, number 3, the American one. Then telephone
the hairdresser and ask if Luigi is still there. Tell him to come and
give me a manicure in three quarters of an hour. Then get my little
grey suit ready, with the pink linen blouse.”<br><br>

“The one with the collar like this?” Julie asked, drawing a low-cut
shape in the air.<br><br>

Florence hesitated. “Yes ... no ... yes ... that one, and the new
little hat with the cornflowers. Oh, Julie, I really never thought I
would get to wear that little hat. Well ... you’re right, I mustn’t think
about it any more, I’d go mad ... I wonder if they have any more of
that ochre powder, the last one ... “<br><br>

“We’ll have to find out ... Madame would be wise to buy several
boxes. It came from England.”<br><br>

“You don’t have to tell me! You know, Julie, we don’t really understand
what is going on. These events will have an unimaginable
impact, believe me, unimaginable ... People’s lives will be changed <b>[p.160]</b> 
for generations. We’ll be hungry this winter. Just get out my grey
leather handbag with the gold clasp, that’s all ... I wonder what Paris
is like,” said Florence walking into the bathroom. But the noise of the
running water Julie had just turned on drowned out her words.<br><br>

Meanwhile, less frivolous thoughts were passing through Corte’s
mind. He too was lying in the bath. At first he had been filled with
such joy, such profound natural peace, that he was reminded of the
delights of childhood: his happiness when eating an iced meringue
full of cream; dipping his feet in a cool stream; pressing a new toy to
his heart. He felt no desire, no regret, no anguish. His head was clear
and calm; his body floated in a warm, liquid element that caressed
him, gently tickled his skin, washed away the dust, the sweat, insinuated
itself between his toes and slid beneath his back like a mother
lifting her sleeping child. The bathroom smelled of tar soap, hair lotion,
eau de Cologne, lavender water. He smiled, stretched out his
arms, cracked the knuckles on his long, pale fingers, savoured the divine,
simple pleasure of being safe from the bombs and taking a cool
bath on a very hot day. He couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment when
bitterness cut through him like a sharp knife through a piece of fruit.
Perhaps it was when he happened to glance at the suitcase full of
manuscripts on the chair, or when the soap fell into the water and he
had to fish it out, the strain to his muscles disrupting his state of euphoria.
Whenever it was, at a certain point he frowned and his face,
which had been clearer, smoother than usual, almost rejuvenated, became
sombre and anxious once again.<br><br>

What would become of him? What would become of Gabriel
Corte? What was happening to the world? What would be the general
mood in future? Either people would think only about being able
to survive and there would be no place for Art, or they would become
obsessed by a new ideal, as after every crisis before. A new ideal? A
new fashion, more like, he thought with cynicism and weariness. But
he, Corte, was too old to adapt to new tastes. He had already changed
his style in 1920. A third time would be impossible. It exhausted him
just to think about what was to come, what kind of world was about
to be born. Who could predict the shape it would take as it emerged
from the harsh matrix of this war, as from a bronze mould. It would <b>[p.161]</b> 
be magnificent or misshapen (or both), this universe now showing its
first signs of life. It was terrible to look at himself, to see himself ...
and to understand nothing. For he understood nothing. He thought
of his book, his manuscript sitting on a chair, rescued from the fire,
from the bombs. He felt intensely despondent. The passions he described,
his feelings, his scruples, this history of a generation, his
generation-they were all old, useless, obsolete. “Obsolete!” he repeated
in despair. And a second time the soap, slippery as a fish, disappeared
into the water. He swore, sat up, angrily rang the bell; his
servant came in.<br><br>

“Rub me down,” Gabriel Corte sighed, his voice shaking.<br><br>

Once his legs had been massaged with the glove and the eau de
Cologne applied, Corte felt better. Standing naked in the bathroom
he began to shave while the servant laid out his clothes: a linen shirt,
a lightweight tweed suit, a blue tie.<br><br>

“Are there any people we know?” asked Corte.<br><br>

“I don’t know, Monsieur. I haven’t seen many people, though I’ve
been told a lot of cars arrived last night and then left straightaway for
Spain. Monsieur Jules Blanc was here. He went to Portugal.”<br><br>

“Jules Blanc?”<br><br>

Corte paused, his soapy razor poised in mid-air. Jules Blanc, gone
to Portugal, on the run! This piece of news was a bad blow. Like
everyone who makes sure they get the most comfort and pleasure
from life, Gabriel Corte had a politician in his pocket. In exchange for
excellent dinners, wonderful parties, Florence’s little attentions, in
exchange for a few well-placed and timely newspaper articles, he had
had from Jules Blanc (member with portfolio in nearly every Cabinet,
twice Prime Minister, four times Minister of War) thousands of the
small favours that make life easier. It was thanks to Jules Blanc that
he had been commissioned to present his Great Lovers series on the
radio last winter. It was Jules Blanc who had given him responsibility
for the patriotic addresses and moral exhortations broadcast on the
radio, and it was Jules Blanc who had insisted that the head of an important
daily newspaper pay IJO,ooo francs instead of the 8o,ooo previously
agreed for Corte’s novel. Finally, he had promised that Corte
would be made a Commander of the Legion of Honour. Jules Blanc <b>[p.162]</b> 
was a small but necessary cog in the machinery of his career, for
genius cannot simply float in the clouds, it must also operate down
on earth.<br><br>

On learning of his friend’s fall (Blanc must have been involved in
some pretty dishonest business to have taken this desperate measure,
since it was he who always liked to say that, in politics, defeat prepares
you for victory), Corte felt alone and abandoned at the edge of
an abyss. Once again, he was struck with dreadful force by the
existence of a new world, unknown to him, a world where everyone
would become miraculously chaste, selfless and full of noble
ideals. Already, that tendency to imitate which is an integral part
of the survival instinct for plants, animals and people, made him declare:
“Ah, so he’s left? The day of these hedonists, these political
wheeler-dealers is over ... “ After a moment’s silence he added,
“Poor France ... “<br><br>

Slowly he put on his blue socks. Naked, except for his black silk
suspenders and socks, his skin a shiny white with yellowish tinges, he
did some arm and chest exercises, then looked at himself approvingly
in the mirror. “Now that is definitely better,” he said, as if he expected
the words to make his servant very happy. Then he finished
dressing.<br><br>

He went down to the bar just after noon. There was a certain panic
going on in the lobby and it was clear that distant disasters were sending
tremors through the rest of the universe. People had left their
luggage piled untidily on the stage that was normally used as a dance
floor; shouting was coming from the kitchens; pale, dishevelled
women were wandering around the corridors looking for a room; the
lifts weren’t working; and an old man was crying, standing in front of
a porter who refused to give him a bed.<br><br>

“You must understand, Monsieur, it’s not that I don’t want to, but
it’s impossible, simply impossible. We’re full to bursting, Monsieur.”<br><br>

“Just a tiny little corner room, that’s all,” begged the poor man. “I
told my wife I would meet her here. We got separated in the bombing
in Etampes. She’ll think I’m dead. I’m seventy years old, Monsieur,
and she’s sixty-eight. We’ve never been apart before.” He took out
his wallet, hands trembling. “I’ll give you a thousand francs.” And on <b>[p.163]</b> 
this ordinary Frenchman’s honest, modest face you could see his
shame at having to offer a bribe for the first time in his life, and his
fear at having to spend all his money.<br><br>

But the porter refused to take it. “I’m telling you, Monsieur, it’s
impossible. Try in town.”<br><br>

“In town? But I’ve just come from there! I’ve been knocking at
doors since five o’clock this morning. They treat me like a dog! I’m
not just anyone. I’m a physics teacher at the Saint-Omer sixth-form
college. I’ve been decorated for services to education.”<br><br>

But he finally realised the porter had stopped listening a long time
ago and had turned his back on him. Picking up a little hatbox he’d
dropped on the ground, which clearly contained all his belongings,
he left without saying a word.<br><br>

The porter was now fighting off four Spanish women with black
hair and heavy make-up. One of them was clutching his arm. “Once
in a lifetime, all right, it happens, but twice is too much,” she exclaimed
in bad French, her voice hoarse and loud. “To have lived
through the war in Spain, escaped to France and then end up in this
mess, it’s too much!”<br><br>

“But Madame, there’s really nothing I can do!”<br><br>

“You can give me a room!”<br><br>

“That’s impossible, Madame, impossible.”<br><br>

The Spaniard tried to think of some scathing reply, an insult, but
her mind was blank. For a moment she was choked with anger; then
she exlaimed, “Well, you’re not what I call a man!”<br><br>

“Me?” shouted the porter, suddenly losing all his professional
passivity and jumping up and down in outrage. “And what about
you? Have you quite finished insulting me? Just remember you’re a
foreigner-so shut up or I’ll call the police.” Regaining a little of his
dignity, he held open the door and pushed out the four women who
were still shouting insults in Castilian.<br><br>

“What hard days, Monsieur, and nights,” he said to Corte. “The
world has gone mad, Monsieur!”<br><br>

Corte walked into a long, cool room; it was silent and dark, and
the bar was quiet. All the commotion stopped at this doorway. The
closed shutters on the large windows protected him from the heat of <b>[p.164]</b> 
the raging sun; the aroma of quality leather, excellent cigars and vintage
brandy hung in the air. The Italian barman, an old friend of
Corte’s, welcomed him impeccably, expressing his joy at seeing him
again and his sympathy at France’s misfortunes. He did this with
such dignity and tact, mindful of his inferior status with regard to
Corte and aware that the terrible events demanded respect, that Corte
felt immediately comforted. “I’m pleased to see you as well, my good
man,” he said gratefully.<br><br>

“Did Monsieur have difficulty leaving Paris?”<br><br>

“Ah!” was all Corte said. He raised his eyes to heaven. Joseph, the
barman, made a discreet little gesture with his hand as if to prevent
Corte from confiding in him, refusing to be the one to bring back
such fresh, painful memories, and in the same way a doctor might say
to a patient who is having a fit, “Drink this first, then you can tell me
all about it,” he murmured, “Shall I fix you a martini?”<br><br>

With the chilled glass and two small dishes of olives and crisps in
front of him, Corte took in the familiar surroundings with the weak
smile of a convalescent. He then looked at the men who had just
j·oined him in the room. Well, well! They were all there: the academic
and the former minister, the important industrialist, the editor, the
head of a newspaper, the MP, the playwright and the writer who,
under the pseudonym “General X,” wrote articles for an important
Parisian magazine in which he summarised military events for the
masses in great technical detail and with the utmost optimism, while
always managing to remain vague: “The next military theatre of operations
will be in northern Europe or the Balkans or the Ruhr or all
three simultaneously, or else at some point on the globe impossible to
predict.” Yes, they were all here and in perfect health. For a brief moment
Corte was stunned. He couldn’t have said why, but for the past
twenty-four hours he had thought the old world was crumbling and.
he was the only man left amid the rubble. It was an inexpressible relief
to see once again all his famous friends, even his enemies. Today,
any disagreements seemed unimportant. They were all on the same
side, they were all together! They were living proof that nothing was
changing. Contrary to belief, they weren’t witnessing some extraordinary
cataclysm, the end of the world, but rather a series of purely <b>[p.165]</b> 
human events, limited in time and space, which, all in all, affected
only the lives of people they didn’t know.<br><br>

Their conversation was pessimistic, almost despairing, but their
voices light-hearted. Some of them had done very well for themselves;
they were at that age when one looks at young people and
thinks, “Let them make their own way!” Others were compiling a
hasty mental inventory of all the pages they’d written, all the speeches
they’d given, which might help them win favour with the new government
(and since they had all more or less lamented the fact that
France had lost her greatness, lost her daring and was no longer producing
children, none of them was very worried). The politicians
were rather more anxious, for some of them were in a difficult position
and were pondering a change of alliance. The playwright and
Corte discussed their own work, without a thought for the rest of the
world.<br><br>


<b>[p.166]</b> <br><br>

<h2>28</h2><br><br>

The Michauds never made it to Tours. A bomb destroyed the railway
line, the train stopped and the refugees found themselves once more
on the road, mingling with the German troops. They were ordered to
go back the way they had come.<br><br>

The Michauds found Paris half empty. They had been away for
two weeks and expected to find it different, as one does after a long
trip. Instead, they walked home through the untouched streets and
couldn’t believe their eyes: everything was in its place. The blazing
sun shone down on the houses, all with their shutters closed, exactly
as on the day they had left; a sudden heatwave had shrivelled all the
leaves on the plane trees, but no one had swept them up and tl1e
refugees waded through them with weary legs. There didn’t seem to
be a food shop open. Now and again, this barren landscape threw up
a surprise: it looked like a city wiped out by the plague, but just as you
were about to scream, “Everybody’s either dead or gone,” you’d find
yourself face to face with a nicely dressed lady wearing make-up or,
in the Michauds’ case, a woman getting a perm at a hairdresser’s nestled
between a boarded-up butcher’s shop and bakery. It was Madame
Michaud’s hairdresser. She called to him. He, his assistant, his wife
and the client all ran to the door and exclaimed, “Were you on the
roads?”<br><br>

Madame Michaud pointed to her bare legs, her torn dress, her face
covered with sweat and dust. “As you can see! What’s happened to
our apartment?”<br><br>

“Well, everything is fine. I was walking past your windows just
today,” said the hairdresser’s wife. “Nothing’s been touched.”<br><br>

“What about my son? Jean-Marie? Has anyone seen him?”<br><br>

“How could you expect anyone to have seen him, my poor darling?”
said Maurice who had joined her. “You’re not being logical.”<br><br>

<b>[p.167]</b> <br><br>

“And what about you, always so calm? You’ll be the death of me,”
she replied angrily. “Maybe the concierge ... “ and she turned to go.<br><br>

“Don’t get upset, Madame Michaud. There’s nothing for you. I
asked as I was passing. There’s no post any more.”<br><br>

Jeanne tried to hide her cruel disappointment with a smile. “All
right, all we can do is wait,” she said, but her lips were trembling. She
sat down without thinking and murmured, “What should we do
now?”<br><br>

“If I were you,” said the hairdresser, a fat little man with a round,
sweet face, “I’d start by having your hair washed; it will clear your
mind; we could also freshen Monsieur Michaud up a bit, and while
I’m doing that my wife can make you something to eat.”<br><br>

So it was agreed. He was massaging Jeanne’s head with lavender
oil when his son ran in to announce that the armistice had been
signed. She was too exhausted and downcast to take in the importance
of the news-just as a person who has shed so many tears at the
bedside of someone who is dying has none left for the actual moment
of death. But Maurice, remembering 1914, the battles, his wounds, his
suffering, felt a wave of bitterness wash over his heart. But there was
nothing more to say, so he remained silent.<br><br>

They were in Madame Josse’s salon for more than an hour, then
left to go home. People were saying that there were relatively few
casualties among French soldiers, but that the prisoners numbered
nearly two million. Could Jean-Marie perhaps be a prisoner? They
daren’t hope for anything more. They reached their house. Despite
all Madame Josse’s assurances, they couldn’t really believe that it was
still standing and not reduced to ashes like the burning buildings they
had walked past last week in the Place du Martroi, in Orleans. But
they could see the door, the concierge’s lodge, the letter box (empty!),
the key waiting for them and the concierge herself. The risen Lazarus
must have experienced the same feeling of astonishment and quiet
pride on seeing his sisters and the soup cooking on the fire: “In spite
of everything, we’ve come back, we’re home,” they thought.<br><br>

“But what’s the point if my son ... “ was Jeanne’s second thought.<br><br>

She looked at Maurice who smiled weakly at her, then said out
loud to the concierge, “Hello, Madame Nonnain.” ·<br><br>

The concierge was elderly and half deaf. The Michauds cut short <b>[p.168]</b> 
their stories of the exodus as much as possible. Madame Nonnain had
gone as far as the Porte d’Italie with her daughter, who was a laundress.
She had then had an argument with her son-in-law and come
back home. “They have no idea what’s happened to me; they probably
think I’m dead,” she said with some satisfaction. “They probably
think they’re going to get hold of my savings now. Not that she’s a
bad sort,” she added, referring to her daughter, “she’s just a bit too
clever for her own good.”<br><br>

The Michauds said they were tired and went up to their apartment.
The lift was broken. “Well, that’s the last straw,” Jeanne
moaned, laughing in spite of herself.<br><br>

While her husband slowly climbed the stairs, she rushed on ahead,
recovering the speed and stamina she’d had as a young girl. My God,
to think she had sometimes cursed this dark staircase, their basic
apartment with no cupboards, no bathroom (they’d had to get a bathtub
put in the kitchen) and radiators that regularly broke down in
dead of winter! The cosy world in which she had lived for fifteen
years and whose walls contained such sweet, such warm memories,
had been returned to her. Peering over the banister, she saw Maurice
much further down. She was alone. She leaned forward to kiss the
door, then got out her key and opened it. It was her apartment, her
refuge. Here were Jean-Marie’s room, the kitchen, the sitting room
and the sofa on which, after getting home from the bank in the
evening, she would stretch out her tired legs.<br><br>

Remembering the bank suddenly made her shudder. She hadn’t
thought about it in a week. When Maurice came in, he saw she was
worried and that her joy at being home had vanished. “What’s the
matter?” he asked. “Is it Jean-Marie?”<br><br>

“No, the bank.”<br><br>

“My God, we did everything humanly possible and more to get to
Tours. They couldn’t possibly hold it against us.~’<br><br>

“They won’t hold it against us,” she said, “if they want to keep us.
But I’ve only worked there on an interim basis since the war, and as
for you, my poor darling, you’ve never been able to get along with
them, so if they want to get rid of us, now’s the time.”<br><br>

“The thought had crossed my mind.”<br><br>

<b>[p.169]</b> <br><br>

As always, when he agreed wholeheartedly and didn’t argue with
her, she suddenly changed her mind. “Nevertheless, they’d have to
be the worst bastards ... “<br><br>

“They are the worst bastards,” Maurice said gently, “you know
that, don’t you? We’ve had our share of worries. We’re together,
we’re at home. Let’s not think about anything else ... “<br><br>

They didn’t mention Jean-Marie. They couldn’t even say his
name without crying, and they didn’t want to cry. They had always
had a burning desire to be happy. Perhaps because they loved each
other so much, they had learned to live one day at a time, deliberately
not thinking about tomorrow.<br><br>

They weren’t hungry. They opened a jar of jam, a box of biscuits
and, with infinite care, Jeanne made them some coffee: there was only
a quarter of a pound left of the pure mocha coffee they usually saved
for special occasions.<br><br>

“But what more special occasion could there be?” said Maurice.<br><br>

“None like this, I hope,” his wife replied. “Still, we can’t pretend
we’ll be able to replace it easily if the war drags on.”<br><br>

“You make it seem almost sinful,” said Maurice, breathing in the
wonderful aroma wafting up from the coffee pot.<br><br>

After their light meal, they sat down by the open window. They
both had a book open on their laps but they weren’t reading. They finally
fell asleep, side by side, holding hands.<br><br>

They spent several days rather peacefully. Since there was no post,
they knew they couldn’t get any news, good or bad. All they could do
was wait.<br><br>

At the beginning of July, Monsieur de Furieres returned to Paris.
It was said, after the armistice of 1919, that the Count de Furieres had
had a “good war”: he had faced danger heroically for a few months,
then married a very rich young woman while on leave. After that he
cared a little less for the idea of getting himself killed, which was understandable.
Nevertheless, he refused to take advantage of his wife’s
excellent connections. If he no longer sought out danger, he didn’t
run away from it either. He finished the war without once being
wounded, pleased with himself for his commendable behaviour in
battle, his inner confidence and his military decoration. In 1939 he <b>[p.170]</b> 
held an excellent place in society: his wife was a Salomon-Worms, his
sister had married the Marquis de Maigle; he was a member of the
Jockey Club; his receptions and hunting parties were famous; he had
two charming daughters, the elder of whom had recently become engaged.
He had considerably less money than in I92o but was now
better equipped than before to do without it or to get hold of some
when necessary. He had accepted the position of Director of the
Corbin Bank.<br><br>

Corbin was quite simply an uncouth individual who had begun his
career in a lowly and almost vile manner. (It was said he had been a
bellboy in an establishment offering loans on the Rue Trudaine.) But
Corbin was also extremely adept when it came to banking and, in the
end, he and the Count got along rather well. They were both very intelligent
and understood how useful they were to each other; understanding
this created a sort of friendship based on cordial contempt,
just like certain liqueurs, which are sharp and bitter on their own but
have a pleasant taste when mixed together. “He’s a degenerate, like
all aristocrats,” Corbin would mutter. “The poor man eats with his
fingers,” Furieres would say with a sigh. By dangling the prospect of
the Jockey Club in front of Corbin’s eyes, the Count got whatever he
wanted from him.<br><br>

All in all, Furieres had organised his life most comfortably. When
the second great war of the century broke out, he felt almost like a
child who has worked hard at school, done nothing wrong and is
thoroughly enjoying himself when someone tells him he must once
again be dragged away from his pleasures. “Once, all right, but twice,
that’s just too much!” he was tempted to cry out. “Pick on someone
else, dammit!” How could this be happening? He had already done
his duty. He had given five years of his youth and now they wanted to
steal his precious middle years-those beautiful years when a man finally
understands what he is about to lose and is eager to make the
most of it. “No, it’s going too far,” he remarked despondently to
Corbin when he said goodbye to him the day everyone was mobilised.
“I’m doomed. I’ll never get out alive again.”<br><br>

He was an officer in the Reserves; he had to go. He could have
fixed it ... but his desire for continued self-respect held him back-a
very strong inner desire that allowed him a severe, ironic attitude <b>[p.171]</b> 
towards the rest of the world. He left. His chauffeur, who was in the
same situation as him, said, “If you have to go, you go. But if they
think it’ll be like ‘14, they’ve got it all wrong.” (The word “they” in
his mind meant some mythical council whose purpose and passion
was to send other people to their deaths.) “If they think we’ll do that
again” (flicking his nail on his tooth), “that on top of what is strictly
necessary, well, I’m telling you, they’ve got another thing coming.”<br><br>

The Count de Furieres would certainly not have expressed his
own thoughts in this way, but they were nevertheless very similar to
his chauffeur’s and simply reflected the state of mind of many former
soldiers. A large number of men went off to war this way, feeling
muted bitterness or hopeless rebellion against fate, which twice in
their lifetimes had played this horrible trick on them.<br><br>

During the June debacle almost the entire regiment of de Furieres
fell into enemy hands. He himself had the chance to escape and he
took it. In ‘14 he would have preferred to be killed rather than survive
the disaster. In ‘40 he preferred to live. He returned to his wife, who
was already mourning his death, to his charming daughters, the eldest
of whom had just got married (to a young inspector of Public
Finances), and to the de Furieres chateau. The chauffeur wasn’t as
lucky: he was taken to Stalag VII A and became prisoner number
55,481.<br><br>

Upon his return, the Count got in touch with Corbin, who had
remained in the Free Zone, and they both set about trying to
bring the bank’s scattered sections back together. The Accounting
Department was in Cahors, the executives in Bayonne, the secretaries
had headed for Toulouse but had got lost somewhere between Nice
and Perpignan. No one seemed to know where the bank’s papers had
ended up.<br><br>

“It’s chaos, a mess, unspeakable mayhem,” Corbin said to de
Furieres the morning of their first meeting.<br><br>

He had crossed the demarcation line during the night and welcomed
de Furieres into an apartment empty of servants. They had all
fled during the exodus, and he suspected them of having taken some
brand-new suitcases and his morning coat, which aroused within him
even more patriotic fury.<br><br>

“You know me, don’t you? I’m not usually emotional, but I <b>[p.172]</b> 
nearly cried, my dear man, nearly cried like a baby when I saw the
first German at the border. Very correct he was, none of this casual
French demeanour, you know, as if to say ‘we’re pals.’ No, really very
correct, a brief salute, cpnfident stance, but without being stiff,
very correct ... Well, what do you think? Aren’t our officers just the
worst!”<br><br>

“Excuse me,” said Furieres curtly, “but I don’t see how you can reproach
our officers. What do you expect them to do with no weapons
and a load of hopeless troops who only want you to p*** off and leave
them in peace. First give us some real men.”<br><br>

“Oh, but <i>they</i> say ‘there was no one in charge,’” said Corbin, delighted
to offend Furieres, “and just between us, old boy, I saw some
pathetic sights ... “<br><br>

“Without the civilians, without everyone panicking, that wave of
refugees blocking up the roads, we would have had a chance.”<br><br>

“Well, you’re right there! The panic was terrible. People are
extraordinary. For years we’ve heard nothing but ‘it’s all-out war,
all-out war’-you would have thought they’d have expected it. But
no! Immediately there’s panic, chaos, exodus, and why? I’m asking
you, why? It’s insane! <i>I</i> only left because the banks were ordered to
go. Otherwise, you know ... “<br><br>

“Was it terrible in Tours?”<br><br>

“Absolutely terrible ... but again for the same reason: the flood of
refugees. I couldn’t find a room outside Tours so I had to sleep in the
city and, naturally, we were bombed, forced out by the fires,” said
Corbin, thinking indignantly of the little chateau in the countryside
where they had turned him away because some Belgian refugees were
staying there. They hadn’t been hit, not them, while he, Corbin, had
nearly been buried under the rubble in Tours. “And the chaos,” he
repeated, “everyone thinking only of himself! Such egotism ... It
makes you wonder about mankind ... As for your staff, they were the
worst of all. Not one of them was able to meet me in Tours. They all
lost contact with each other. I’d told all our departments to stay together.
Do you think they cared? Some are in the Midi, some are up
north. You can’t count on anyone. These are the circumstances in
which you can judge a man, his drive, his energy, his guts. A bunch of <b>[p.173]</b> 
drips, I’m telling you, a bunch of drips! Only interested in saving
their own skin, without a thought for the bank or me. Well, some of
them are going to get the sack, I can assure you of that. Besides, I
don’t imagine we’re going to have much business.”<br><br>

The conversation turned to more technical matters, which gave
them a pleasant feeling of their own importance, barely diminished,
despite recent events.<br><br>

“A German group,” Corbin said, “is going to buy out Eastern
Steelworks. We’re not in too bad a position there. Though it’s true
that the business with the Rouen Docks ... “<br><br>

They became depressed. Furieres said goodbye. Corbin wanted to
walk him out, but when he tried to turn on the lights in the drawing
room where the shutters were closed, there was no electricity. He
started swearing.<br><br>

“This man is so vulgar,” the Count thought. “Give them a
call,” he advised. “They won’t take long to fix it. The telephone’s
working.”<br><br>

“You just can’t imagine how chaotic everything is here,” Corbin
said, choking with rage. “The servants have all taken off-all of
them, I’m telling you-and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they
made off with some of the silver! My wife isn’t here. I’m lost in all
this mess, I’m .. .”<br><br>

“Is Madame Corbin in the Free Zone?”<br><br>

“Yes,” Corbin grumbled.<br><br>

He and his wife had had a painful row: in the chaos of the hurried
departure, or perhaps out of malice, the chambermaid had put a small
framed picture belonging to Monsieur Corbin in Madame Corbin’s
bag; it contained a photograph of Arlette, stark naked. The nudity itself
might not have offended his wife-she was a person with a great
deal of common sense-but the dancer was wearing a magnificent
necklace. “But it’s not real, I promise you!” Monsieur Corbin had
said with venom. His wife refused to believe him. As for Arlette,
there was no sign of her. He had heard she was in Bordeaux and was
often seen in the company of German officers. Thinking of this only
made Monsieur Corbin’s mood worse. He pushed his buzzer with all
his might.<br><br>

<b>[p.174]</b> <br><br>

“All I have left is a typist I met in Nice. Stupid as they come but
rather pretty. Oh, there you are,” he said suddenly to the young
brunette who came into the room. “The electricity’s been cut off. See
what you can do about it. Telephone them and give them a good talking
to. Well, get on with it-and then bring me the post.”<br><br>

“The post hasn’t been brought up?”<br><br>

“No, it’s with the concierge. Chop chop. Go and get it. Do you
think I’m paying you to do nothing?”<br><br>

“I’m leaving,” said Furieres. “You frighten me.”<br><br>

Corbin caught a glimpse of the Count’s slightly scornful smile; his
anger increased. “Poseur, crook,” he thought. Out loud he replied,
“What do you want me to do? They’re driving me crazy.”<br><br>

The post contained a letter from the Michauds. They had gone to
the bank’s head office in Paris but no one could tell them anything
definite. They had written to Nice and the letter had just been forwarded
to Corbin. The Michauds were asking for instructions and
some money.<br><br>

Corbin’s vague bad temper finally found something to latch on to.
“Ha! That’s a good one!” he exclaimed. “They’ve got some nerve!
You run around bending over backwards for people, nearly get killed
on the roads of France. Meanwhile Monsieur and Madame Michaud
have a nice holiday in Paris and then have the cheek to demand
money. You’re going to write to them,” he said to the terrified typist.
“Take this down:”<br><br>

<blockquote><i>Monsieur Maurice Michaud<br>
23 rue Rousselet<br>
Paris VIIe<br><br>

Paris, 25 July 1940<br><br>

Monsieur<br>
On 11 June we gave both you and Madame Michaud the
order to take up your duties in the city to which the hank had
been evacuted, that is to say Tours. You will not he unaware
that during these crucial moments, every employee of the
bank, and you in particular since you hold a position of
trust, is like a soldier. You know what it means to abandon <b>[p.175]</b> 
your post in times such as these. The result of your foilings
was the complete disintegration of the departments entrusted
to you-the Secretarial and Accounting Services. This is not
the only thing for which we hold you responSible. As we
already informed you on 31 December last year when,
despite my goodwill towards you, it was not considered
possible to award you the increased bonus of three thousand
francs that you requested, it has been pointed out that your
department’s efficiency is minimal in comparison with that
of your predecessor’s. Under the circumstances, while
regretting you have waited such a long time to get in touch
with the management, we consider your foilure to contact us
as a resignation, both by you and Madame Michaud. This
resignation, which derives entirely from you and was without
any notice, means we are not required to pay you any
compensation whatsoever. Nevertheless, taking account of
your long employment at the hank as well as the current
situation, we are making an exception and, purely as a
gesture of goodwill, we are allocating you compensation
equivalent to two months’ salary. Please find enclosed,
therefore, a cheque drawn on the Bank of France in Paris,
made payable to you in the sum of ... francs. Would you
please notify us of its safe arrival.<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
Corbin</blockquote></i><br>
Corbin’s letter plunged the Michauds into despair. They had only five
thousand francs in savings, as Jean-Marie’s studies had been expensive.
This and their two months’ salary came to barely fifteen thousand
francs and they owed money to the taxman. It was almost
impossible to find work now; jobs were rare and badly paid. They
had lived a solitary life; they had no relatives, no one to ask for help.
They were exhausted by the journey and depressed by their anguish
over their son. When Jean-Marie was little and she had faced difficulties,
Madame Michaud had often thought, “If only he were old
enough to manage by himself, nothing would really matter.” She had <b>[p.176]</b> 
known she was strong and in good health, she felt courageous, she
feared nothing for herself, nor for her husband, who thought the
same way.<br><br>

Jean-Marie was a man now. Wherever he might be, if he were still
alive, he didn’t need her. Yet this thought offered little consolation.
First of all, she couldn’t imagine that her child could do without her.
And at the same time she realised that now she needed him. All her
courage abandoned her; she recognised Maurice’s frailty: she felt
alone, old, ill. How would they find work? What would they live on
when their fifteen thousand francs ran out? She had a few small pieces
of jewellery; she cherished them. She had always said, “They’re not
worth anything,” but now she couldn’t bring herself to believe that
the charming little pearl brooch, the modest ruby ring, gifts from
Maurice when they were young, which she loved so much, might not
perhaps he sold for a good price. She offered them to the jeweller in
her neighbourhood, then to a larger establishment on the Rue de la
Paix, but both turned her away: the brooch and the ring were pretty
but they were only interested in the stones and they were so small it
wasn’t worth buying them. Madame Michaud was secretly happy at
the thought she could keep them, hut facts were facts: it had been
their only option.<br><br>

By the end of July their savings were almost gone. They had considered
going to see Corbin to explain that they had done their very
best to get to Tours and that if he insisted on letting them go, he at
least owed them the normal compensation. But they both had enough
experience of him to know they didn’t stand a chance. They didn’t
have the money to take him to court and Cor:hin was not easy to intimidate.
They also found it wholly repugnant to think of approaching
this man whom they loathed and mistrusted.<br><br>

“I just can’t do it, Jeanne. Please don’t ask me to, I just can’t,”
Maurice said in his soft, low voice. “I think if I found myself standing
in front of him I’d spit in his face and that wouldn’t help matters.”<br><br>

“No,” said Jeanne, smiling in spite of herself, “but we’re in a terrible
situation, my poor darling. It’s as if we’re heading towards a
deep hole, watching it get closer and closer with each step without
being able to escape. It’s unbearable.”<br><br>

<b>[p.177]</b> <br><br>

“But we have to bear it,” he replied calmly.<br><br>

He’d used the same tone of voice with her when he’d been
wounded in’ I6 and she’d been called to his bedside at the hospital: “I
think my chances of pulling through are about four in ten.” He had
then stopped a moment to think and added conscientiously, “Three
and a half, to be exact.”<br><br>

She placed a tender hand on his forehead and thought despairingly,
“Oh, if only Jean-Marie were here, he would look after us, he
would save us, I know he would. He’s young, he’s strong ... “ Deep
inside, she felt a strange intermingling of her need to protect as a
mother and her need to be protected as a woman. “Where is he, my
darling boy? Is he still alive? Is he in pain? My God, he can’t he dead,
it just isn’t possible!” And her blood ran cold as she realised how very
possible it actually was. The tears she had courageously held hack for
so long welled up in her eyes.<br><br>

“But why are we always the ones who have to suffer?” she cried
out in indignation. “Us and people like us? Ordinary people, the
lower middle classes. If war is declared or the franc devalues, if
there’s unemployment or a revolution, or any sort of crisis, the others
manage to get through all right. We’re always the ones who are
trampled! Why? What did we do? We’re paying for everybody else’s
mistakes. Of course they’re not afraid of us. The workers fight hack,
the rich are powerful. We’re just sheep to the slaughter. I want. to
know why! What’s happening? I don’t understand. You’re a man, you
should understand,” she said angrily to Maurice, no longer knowing
whom to blame for the disaster they were facing. “Who’s wrong?
Who’s right? Why Corbin? Why Jean-Marie? Why us?”<br><br>

“What do you want to understand? There’s nothing to understand,”
he said, forcing himself to stay calm. “Certain laws govern
the world and they’re neither for nor against us. When a storm
strikes, you don’t blame anyone: you know the thunder is the result of
two opposite electrical forces, the clouds don’t know who you are.
You can’t reproach them. And it would be ridiculous if you didthey
wouldn’t understand.”<br><br>

“But it’s not the same thing. What we’re going through is down to
people and people alone.”<br><br>

<b>[p.178]</b> <br><br>

“It only seems like that, Jeanne. It all seems caused by this man or
that, by one circumstance or another, but it’s like in nature: after the
calm comes the storm; it starts out slowly, reaches its peak, then it’s
over and other periods of calm, some longer, some shorter, come
along. It’s just been our bad luck to be born in a century full of
storms, that’s all. They’ll die down.”<br><br>

“Yes,” she said, although she didn’t really follow this abstract argument,
“but what about Corbin? Corbin’s hardly a force of nature,
is he?”<br><br>

“He’s a harmful specimen, like scorpions, snakes, poison mushrooms.
Actually, we’re a little bit to blame. We’ve always known
what Corbin was like. Why did we carry on working for him? You
wouldn’t eat bad mushrooms and you have to be careful with bad
people. There have been several times when we could have found
other jobs, with a bit of courage and determination. And remember,
when we were young I was offered that job as a teacher in Sao Paulo,
but you didn’t want me to go.”<br><br>

“All right, that’s ancient history,” she said, shrugging her
shoulders.<br><br>

“No, I just meant ... “<br><br>

“Yes, you just meant we shouldn’t hold it against anyone. But you
said yourself if you ran into Corbin you’d spit in his face.”<br><br>

They continued arguing, not because they hoped or even wished
to win the other over, but because talking helped them forget their
painful problems.<br><br>

“Who could we speak to?” Jeanne finally exclaimed.<br><br>

“You mean you still don’t understand that nobody cares about
anybody!”<br><br>

She looked at him. “You’re strange; Maurice. You’ve seen people
at their most cynical, their most disillusioned, and at the same time
you’re not unhappy, I mean, not really unhappy inside! Am I
wrong?”<br><br>

“No.”<br><br>

“So what makes it all right, then?”<br><br>

“My certainty that deep down I’m a free man,” he said, after
thinking for a moment. “It’s a constant, precious possession, and <b>[p.179]</b> 
whether I keep it or lose it is up to me and no one else. I desperately
want the insanity we’re living through to end. I desperately want
what has begun to finish. In a word, I desperately want this tragedy to
be over and for us to try to survive it, that’s all. What’s important is
to live: <i>Primum vivere</i>. One day at a time. To survive, to wait, to
hope.”<br><br>

She listened to him without saying a word. Suddenly, she got up
and grabbed her hat from the mantelpiece. He looked at her in astonishment.
“And what I say,” she replied, “is ‘Heaven helps those who
help themselves.’ Which is why I’m going to speak to Furieres. He’s
always been nice to me and he’ll help us, even if it’s only to annoy
Corbin.”<br><br>

Jeanne was right. Furieres spoke to her and promised that she and
.. her husband would each receive compensation totalling six months’
salary, which brought their capital up to about sixty thousand francs.<br><br>

“You see, I managed and heaven helped me,” Jeanne said to her
husband when she got home.<br><br>

“And I did the hoping,” he replied, smiling. “We were both right.’’<br><br>

They were very happy with the outcome but sensed that now that
their money worries were off their minds, at least for the immediate
future, they would be completely overwhelmed by their anguish over
their son.<br><br>


<b>[p.180]</b> <br><br>

<h2>29</h2><br><br>

It was autumn when Charlie Langelet returned home. The porcelain
hadn’t been damaged by the journey. He unpacked the large crates
himself, trembling with joy when he felt, beneath the straw and tissue
paper, the cool smoothness of a pink glass vase or a Sevres statuette.
He still couldn’t believe he was really home, reunited with all his
wonderful possessions. He would raise his eyes now and again to
look through his windows (which still had their strips of coloured
paper) at the delightful curve of the Seine.<br><br>

At noon, the concierge came up to clean; he hadn’t yet
hired any servants. Important events-whether serious, happy or
unfortunate-do not change a man’s soul, they merely bring it into
relief, just as a strong gust of wind reveals the true shape of a tree
when it blows off all its leaves. Such events highlight what is hidden
in the shadows; they nudge the spirit towards a place where it can
flourish. Charlie had always been careful with money, a pennypincher.
When he got back after the exodus, he felt truly miserly. It
gave him real pleasure to save money whenever possible and he was
aware of this for, to top it all off, he had become cynical. Before, he
would never have considered moving into a disorganised house full
of dust; he would have recoiled at the idea of going to a restaurant
the very day he returned. Now, however, he had been through so
much that nothing frightened him. When the concierge told him that
anyway she couldn’t finish the cleaning today, that Monsieur didn’t
realise how much work there was to do, Charlie replied sweetly but
firmly, “You’ll manage somehow, Madame Logre. You’ll just have to
work a bit faster, that’s all.”<br><br>

“Fast and good don’t always go together, Monsieur!”<br><br>

“This time they will. The good old days are over,” Charlie said <b>[p.181]</b> 
sternly, then added, “I’ll be back at six o’clock. I trust that everything
will be ready.”<br><br>

And after an imperious glance at the concierge, who was furious
but said nothing, and a final loving look at his porcelains, he left.
As he went down the stairs he calculated what he was saving: he
wouldn’t have to pay for Madame Logre’s lunch any more; she could
work for him two hours a day for a while; once the heavy work was
done, it wouldn’t take much to keep the apartment in order, and he
could take his time to find some servants, a couple probably. Until
now he had always had a couple, a valet and a cook.<br><br>

He went and had lunch by the river, in a little restaurant he knew.
He didn’t find the food too bad, all things considered (he never ate
much anyway), and the wine he drank was excellent. The owner
whispered in his ear that there was still a bit of real coffee left. Charlie
lit a cigar and felt that life was good. That is to say, no, not good as
such, one mustn’t forget the defeat of France and all the suffering, all
the humiliation that resulted from it, but for him, Charlie, it was good
because he took life as it came, without moaning about the past or
fearing the future.<br><br>

He flicked the ash from his cigar. His money was· in America and
since his funds were frozen, fortunately, he would have to pay less
tax or perhaps even none at all. The franc would remain low for a
long time. His fortune, as soon as he could get hold of it, would automatically
be worth ten times what it was now. As for his day-today
expenses, he’d made sure to put something aside a long time
ago. It was forbidden to buy or sell gold, and it was already fetching
outrageous prices on the black market. He thought with amazement
of the wave of panic that had swept through him when he
had wanted to leave France to go and live in Portugal or South
America. Some of his friends had gone, but he was neither Jewish
nor a Mason, thank God, he thought with a scornful smile. He had
never been involved in politics and didn’t see why he wouldn’t be
left alone, a poor man like him, very quiet, very harmless, who never
hurt anybody and who loved nothing in this world but his porcelain
collection. He thought, on a more serious note, that this was the
secret of his happiness amid so much upheaval. He loved nothing, <b>[p.182]</b> 
at least nothing that time could distort, that death could carry
away; he’d been right not to have married, not to have had children
... My God, everyone else had been taken in. He’d been the
only clever one.<br><br>

But coming back to that mad idea of emigrating: it had been born
of a strange and almost insane belief that, in the space of a few days,
the world was going to change into something horrific, a living hell.
But look ... Everything was the same! He thought of the Bible and
the description of the world before the Flood. How did it go? Oh yes:
people built houses, got married, ate and drank ... Well, the Bible
was incomplete. It should have said, “The Flood waters subsided and
people began once more to build their houses, to marry, to eat and
drink ... “ In fact, people weren’t really very important. It was works
of art, museums, collections that should be saved. What was terrible
about the Spanish War was that artistic masterpieces had been left to
be destroyed; but here the most important works had been saved, except
for some of the chateaux near the Loire, of course. Now that
was unforgivable. But the wine he’d drunk was so good, he felt inclined
to be optimistic. After all, there were some very beautiful
ruins. In Chinon, for example, what could be more admirable than
the great hall with no roof and those walls-walls that had seen Joan
of Arc pass, and where now birds nested and a wild cherry tree grew
in a little corner.<br><br>

After lunch, he wanted to stroll through the streets, but he found
them depressing. There were hardly any cars, it was extraordinarily
silent, and great red flags with swastikas were flying everywhere. In
front of a cheese shop, some women were waiting to be served. This
was the first war he’d seen. Everyone was gloomy. Charlie hastened
towards the Metro, the only transport working. He would visit a bar
where he was often a regular at lunchtime or in the evening. What
havens of peace bars like this were! They were extremely expensive,
and their clientele consisted of wealthy men, past middle age, who
hadn’t been affected by either the mobilisation or the war. Charlie
was alone for a while, but at about six thirty all the old regulars arrived,
safe and sound and in tip-top form, accompanied by charming
and beautifully made-up ladies, who called out from beneath their <b>[p.183]</b> 
adorable little hats, “But it’s him, it’s Charlie, isn’t it? ... Well, now,
not too worn out, are you? Come back to Paris?”<br><br>

“Paris is dreadful, don’t you think?”<br><br>

And almost immediately, as if they were meeting again after the
most peaceful, the most ordinary of summers, they began the kind of
conversation Charlie called “Fragile-Don’t Touch” conversation:
lively and light-hearted small-talk, ranging over any number of subjects
but dwelling on none in particular. Among other things, he
learned that certain young men had been killed or taken prisoner.<br><br>

“Oh, it can’t be! Just imagine ... I hadn’t the slightest idea, it’s
awful! Those poor boys!” he said.<br><br>

The husband of one of the ladies was a prisoner in Germany.<br><br>

“He writes to me regularly. He isn’t too bad, but it’s the boredom,
you see ... I hope to be able to get him out soon.”<br><br>

The more he talked and the more he heard, Charlie found his spirits
rising and he recovered the good mood that had been momentarily
dampened by the sight of the Paris streets. But what succeeded in
cheering him up completely was the hat worn by a woman who had
just come in. All the women were well dressed but with a certain pretence
of simplicity, as if to say, “We couldn’t re~lly dress up, just
imagine! First of all, we have no money and, second, it wouldn’t be
quite right ... I’ll get some more wear out of my old dresses ... “ But
this woman showed off her hat in a daring, courageous and brazenly
happy way. It was a new little hat, hardly bigger than a cocktail napkin,
made of two sable skins, with a russet veil over her golden hair.
As soon as he saw it, Charlie felt totally reassured.<br><br>

It was getting late. Since Charlie wanted to stop at home before
going out to dinner, it was time he went ... but he didn’t want to
leave his friends.<br><br>

“Why don’t we all have dinner together?” someone suggested.<br><br>

“That’s an excellent idea,” Charlie Said warmly. And he proposed
the little restaurant where he’d had such a good lunch, for he was like
a cat by nature, quickly becoming attached to places where he’d been
well treated. “I’ll have to take the Metro again! It’s such a ghastly
place, it’s making my life miserable,” he said.<br><br>

“I was able to get some petrol and a pass, but I can’t offer to drive <b>[p.184]</b> 
you back because I promised to wait for Nadine,” said the woman in
the new hat.<br><br>

“How did you do that? It’s amazing you could manage that!”<br><br>

“Ah well, there it is,” she said, smiling.<br><br>

“Listen, then, let’s meet in about an hour, an hour and a quarter.”<br><br>

“Do you want me to come and collect you?”<br><br>

“No, thanks, you’re very kind; it’s only two minutes from my
place.”<br><br>

“Be careful, it’s pitch black out. They’re very strict about that.”<br><br>

She was right, it’s really dark, Charlie thought as he emerged from
the warm, bright club into the unlit street. It was also raining.
Autumn evenings like this were one of the things he used to like so
much about Paris, but now you could see fires burning in the distance,
and everything was as black and sinister as the inside of a well.
Fortunately, the entrance to the Metro was nearby.<br><br>

At home, Charlie found Madame Logre sweeping the floor in a
preoccupied, gloomy sort of way. At least the drawing room was finished.
Charlie had the urge to put his favourite Sevres statuette on the
shiny Chippendale table-a Venus at the Looking Glass. He took it
out of the packing case, removed the tissue paper it was wrapped in,
looked at it lovingly and was taking it over to the table when the
doorbell rang.<br><br>

“Go and see who it is, Madame Logre.”<br><br>

Madame Logre went out and then came back, saying, “Monsieur, I
told the concierge at number six that Monsieur needed someone and
she’s sent this woman who’s looking for work.”<br><br>

Seeing Charlie hesitate, she added, “She’s a very nice person who
used to be a chambermaid for the Countess Barral du Jeu. She got
married and didn’t want to work any more, but her husband is a prisoner
of war and she needs to earn a living. Monsieur could just see
her and then decide!”<br><br>

“All right, bring her in,” said Langelet, putting the statuette on a
table.<br><br>

The woman made a good impression on him. She seemed modest
and calm, obviously wishing to please but without being subservient.
He could see at once she had been well trained and had worked in fine <b>[p.185]</b> 
homes. She was a big woman. Mentally, Charlie reproached her for
this-he liked his maids to be thin and a bit austere-but she looked
about thirty-five or forty, the perfect age for a servant, when they’ve
stopped working too quickly but are still fit and strong enough to
provide good service. She had a broad face, vast shoulders and her
clothing was simple but appropriate (the dress, coat and hat definitely
hand-me-downs from a former employer).<br><br>

“What’s your name?” Charlie asked, favourably impressed.<br><br>

“Hortense Gaillard, Monsieur.”<br><br>

“All right. And you’re looking for work?”<br><br>

“Well, you see, Monsieur, I left the Countess Barral du Jeu two
years ago to get married. I didn’t think I’d have to go back into service,
but my husband was conscripted and then taken prisoner, and
Monsieur will understand that I have to earn a living. My brother is
unemployed and I’m looking after him, his sick wife and a small
child.”<br><br>

“I understand. I was thinking of hiring a couple ... “<br><br>

“I know Monsieur but maybe I could do instead? I was the head
chamberma’ id for the’ Countess, but before that I worked for the
Countess’s mother as a cook. I could do the cooking and the
cleaning.”<br><br>

“Yes, that’s possible,” Charlie murmured, thinking that such a
combination would be very advantageous financially.<br><br>

Naturally, there was also the matter of serving meals. He did
sometimes have dinner guests, but then he wasn’t expecting too many
this winter.<br><br>

“Do you know how to iron men’s clothing? I’m very particular
about that, you understand.”<br><br>

“I was the one who ironed the Count’s shirts.”<br><br>

“And what about your cooking? I often eat out. I require simple
but carefully prepared food.”<br><br>

“Would Monsieur like to see my references?”<br><br>

She reached into an imitation pigskin handbag and handed them
to him. He read them one after the other; they spoke of her in the
warmest terms: hard-working, extremely well trained, scrupulously
honest, very good at cooking and even making pastries.<br><br>

<b>[p.186]</b> <br><br>

“Even pastries? Very good. I think, Hortense, that we can come to
an arrangement. Were you with the Countess Barral du Jeu for long?”<br><br>

“Five years, Monsieur.”<br><br>

“And is the good lady in Paris? I prefer personal recommendations,
you understand.”<br><br>

“I understand completely, Monsieur. Yes, the Countess is in Paris.
Would Monsieur like her phone number? It’s Auteuil 3814.”<br><br>

“Thank you. Write it down, would you, Madame Logre? And
what about wages? How much were you hoping to earn?”<br><br>

Hortense asked for six hundred francs. He offered four hundred
and fifty. Hortense thought for a moment. Her shrewd little dark eyes
had seen into the soul of this arrogant, well-fed man. And work was
scarce.<br><br>

“I couldn’t do it for less than five hundred and fifty,” she said
firmly. “Monsieur must understand. I had some savings, but they
were all used up during that horrible journey.”<br><br>

“You left Paris?”<br><br>

“During the exodus, yes, Monsieur. Bombed and everything, quite
apart from nearly starving to death on the road. Monsieur doesn’t
know how bad it was.”<br><br>

“But I do know, I do,” Charlie said, sighing. “I too was on the
road. Such sad events! We’ll say five hundred and fifty, then. But listen
now, I’m agreeing because I think you will earn it. I insist on absolute
honesty.”<br><br>

“Oh, Monsieur!” said Hortense in a discreetly scandalised tone of
voice, as if the thought alone would have wounded her to the core,
and Charlie was quick to smile at her reassuringly, to make her see he
was only saying it as a formality, that he didn’t doubt her absolute
integrity for a moment and that moreover the very idea of such dishonesty
was so unbearable to him that he wouldn’t give it another
thought.<br><br>

“I hope you are good at what you do and careful. I have a collection
that is very important to me. I don’t allow anyone to dust the
most precious pieces, but this display cabinet over here, for example,
I would trust you with.”<br><br>

As he seemed to be inviting her to have a look, Hortense glanced <b>[p.187]</b> 
at the half-unpacked cases. “Monsieur has some very beautiful things.
Before going into service for the Countess’s mother I worked for an
American, Mr. Mortimer Shaw. He collected ivory pieces.”<br><br>

“Mortimer Shaw? What a coincidence, I know him well! He’s an
eminent antiques dealer.”<br><br>

“He’s retired, Monsieur.”<br><br>

“And were you with him long?”<br><br>

“Four years. They were the only two jobs I had.”<br><br>

Charlie stood up and saw Hortense to the door, saying encouragingly,
“Come back tomorrow for a definite decision, will you? If the
verbal references are as good as your written ones, which I don’t
doubt for a moment, then you’re hired. Could you start right away?”<br><br>

“On Monday, if Monsieur would like.”<br><br>

After Hortense had gone, Charlie hurried to change his collar and
cuffs and wash his hands. He had had a lot to drink at the bar. He felt
extraordinarily light-headed and pleased with himself. He didn’t wait
for the lift, an ancient, slow piece of equipment, but sped down the
stairs like a young man. He was going to meet his lovely friends, a
charming woman. He was delighted to be able to introduce them to
the little restaurant he’d discovered.<br><br>

“I wonder if they’ve got any of that Carton wine left,” he
thought. The great courtyard door with its wooden panels engraved
with Sirens and Tritons (a marvel, classified a work of art by the
Council for Historic Monuments of Paris) opened and closed behind
him with a faint creak. Once outside, Charlie was immediately
plunged into impenetrable darkness but, feeling as happy and free as
a twenty-year-old, he crossed the road without a care and headed for
the quayside. He’d forgotten his torch, “But I know every step of the
way in my neighbourhood,” he said to himself. “All I have to do is
follow the Seine and cross the Pant Marie. There won’t be many
cars.” And at the very moment he was mentally saying these words, a
car passed two feet in front of him, going extremely fast, its headlights
(painted blue in accordance with regulations) giving off only
the faintest light. Startled, he jumped backwards, slipped, felt himself
lose his balance, flailed his arms about and, finding nothing to grab on
to, fell into the road.<br><br>

<b>[p.188]</b> <br><br>

The car swerved and a woman’s voice screamed in terror, “Watch
out!”<br><br>

It was too late.<br><br>

“I’ve had it. I’m going to be run over! To have made it through so
much danger to end up like this, it’s too ... it’s too ridiculous ...
Someone’s playing a trick on me ... Someone, somewhere is playing
this horrible, bad trick on me ... “<br><br>

Just as a bird, terrified by a gunshot, flies out of its nest and disappears,
so this final conscious thought went through Char lie’s mind
and vanished at the same moment as his life. He took a terrible blow
to the head. The car’s fender had shattered his skull. Blood and brains
spurted out with such force that a few drops landed on the woman
who was driving-a pretty woman, wearing a hat, hardly bigger than
a cocktail napkin, made of two sable skins sewn together and a russet
veil over her golden hair. It was Arlette Corail, back from Bordeaux
the week before. She looked down at the body. “What rotten luck,”
she mumbled, devastated, “but really, what rotten luck!”<br><br>

She was a cautious woman and had her torch with her. She examined
the man’s face, at least what was left of it, and recognised
Charles Langelet. “Oh, the poor guy! ... I was going fast, all right,
but he couldn’t have been paying attention, the silly fool! What am I
going to do now?”<br><br>

Nevertheless, she remembered that her insurance, licence, pass,
were all in order, and she knew someone influential who would fix
everything for her. Somewhat reassured but her heart still pounding,
she sat down for a moment on the car’s running board, lit a cigarette,
fixed her make-up with trembling hands, then went to get help.<br><br>

Madame Logre had finally finished cleaning the study and library.
She went into the drawing room to get the vacuum cleaner. As
she pulled out the plug, the handle of the vacuum cleaner knocked
against the table where the <i>Venus at the Looking Glass</i> was displayed.
Madame Logre screamed: the statuette had fallen on to the floor. The
head of Venus was smashed to bits.<br><br>

Madame Logre wiped her forehead with her apron, hesitated a
moment, then, leaving the statuette where it was, put the vacuum
cleaner away. After that, in a manner that was surprising for such a <b>[p.189]</b> 
stout woman she rushed silently and nimbly out of the apartment.
“Right, I’ll just say the door flew open and a gust of wind knocked
the statue over. It’s his fault tool Why leave it at the edge of the
table? And anyway,” she said angrily, “I don’t care what he says. He
can go to hell for all I care!”<br><br>


<b>[p.190]</b> <br><br>

<h2>30</h2><br><br>

If anyone had told Jean-Marie that he would one day find himself in
a remote village far from his regiment, with no money, no way to
communicate with his family, not knowing whether they were safe
and sound in Paris or, like so many others, buried in a shell hole
somewhere beside a road, and above all, ifanyone had told him that,
after France had been defeated, he would still be alive and would
sometimes even be happy, he wouldn’t have believed it. Yet that was
what had happened. The very magnitude of the disaster, the fact that
they had passed the point of no return, in itself provided some consolation,
just as certain deadly poisons provide their own antidote: all
his suffering was irreversible. He couldn’t change the fact that the
Maginot Line had been circumvented, or broken through (no one
knew for sure), that two million soldiers had been taken prisoner, that
France had been defeated. He couldn’t make the post, the telegraphs
or the telephones work, couldn’t get hold of any petrol or a car to go
to the railway station twenty-one kilometres away, and there weren’t
any trains anyway as the tracks had been destroyed. He couldn’t walk
to Paris for he had been seriously wounded and was only now just
starting to get out of bed. He couldn’t pay his hosts, for he had no
money and no way of getting any. It was too much for him; all he
could do was calmly stay where he was and wait.<br><br>

This feeling of absolute dependence on other people brought
about a kind of peace within him. He didn’t even have his own
clothes: his uniform had been torn and burned in places so he wore
a khaki shirt and spare pair of trousers belonging to one of the
farmhands. Meanwhile, he had managed to get himself demobilised
by secretly crossing the demarcation line and giving a false address;
so he no longer ran the risk of being taken prisoner. He was still <b>[p.191]</b> 
living on the farm, but since he had recovered, he had moved from the
bed in the kitchen to a little room above the hayloft. Through its
round window he could see lovely, peaceful fields, fertile land and
woods. At night he could hear mice scurrying above his head and the
cooing of doves in the dovecote.<br><br>

Living constantly in fear of death like this was only bearable if
you took one day at a time, if you said to yourself each evening,
“Another twenty-four hours when nothing really bad has happened,
thank God! Let’s see what tomorrow brings.” Everyone around JeanMane
felt this way, or at least acted as if they did. They tended the
animals, the hay, made butter ... No one ever mentioned tomorrow.
They made provision for the years to come, planting trees that would
bear fruit in five or six seasons, fattening up the pigs they could eat
two years later, but they did nothing about the immediate future. If
Jean-Marie asked if it would be fine the next day (the usual question a
Parisian on holiday would ask), they would say, “Well, we don’t
know ... How should we know?” If he asked, “Will there be any
fruit?” they’d reply, “Maybe a little ... “ looking sceptically at the
small, hard green pears trained up the trellis. “We can’t really tell ...
we don’t know ... we’ll see when the time comes ... “ An almost
hereditary instinct about the tricks of fate-the April frosts, the hail
that ravaged the fields just before harvest, the drought in July that
shrivelled up the kitchen garden-inspired wisdom and caution
within them, but at the same time gave them something to do every
day. “They’re not exactly likeable but you have to admire them,”
thought Jean-Marie, who had barely had any contact with the
countryside: for five generations the Michauds had lived in the city.<br><br>

The people of this hamlet were welcoming and amiable; the men
were smooth talkers, the women coquettish. Once you got to know
them, you discovered they were determined, tough, sometimes even
surprisingly malicious, perhaps a result of some obscure atavistic
memory of hate and fear that had been passed through the blood line
from one generation to the next. Yet at the same time they were generous.
The farmer’s wife, who wouldn’t have given an egg to a neighbour
and held out for every penny she could get when selling her
poultry, listened in dismal silence, together with the rest of her <b>[p.192]</b> 
family, when Jean-Marie told them that he wanted to leave the farm because
he had no money, that he didn’t want them to have to support
him and that he would try to make it to Paris on foot. “It isn’t right to
talk like that, Monsieur, “ she declared with a strange kind of dignity.
“You’re upsetting us ... “<br><br>

“But what else can I do?” said Jean-Marie, sitting next to her with
his head in his hands, still feeling very weak.<br><br>

“You can’t do anything. You have to wait.”<br><br>

“Yes, of course, the post will be working again soon,” the young
man murmured, “and if my parents are actually in Paris ... “<br><br>

“We’ll see when the time comes ... “ said the farmer’s wife.<br><br>

Nowhere else would it have been as easy to forget the outside
world. Without letters and newspapers, the only link with the rest of
the universe was the radio, but the farmers had heard the Germans
were confiscating the sets, so they hid them in lofts and old wardrobes,
or buried them in the fields along with the hunting rifles they were
supposed to have handed over. The village was in the Occupied
Zone, very close to the demarcation line, but the German troops
weren’t stationed there; in fact, they had only passed through the village
and never climbed the hill to the hamlet, which was two kilometres
away along rough, rocky paths. Food was beginning to run out in
the cities and certain other areas; here, there was even more food than ·
usual, for there was no way of transporting their produce away from
the village. Never in his life had Jean-Marie eaten so much butter,
chicken, cream, or so many peaches. He recovered quickly. He even
started putting on weight, the farmer’s wife said, and in her kindness
towards Jean-Marie there was a strange desire to make a deal with the
Good Lord-to save one life for Him in exchange for the other life
He held in His hands: just as she offered grain to the chickens in exchange
for their eggs, so she tried to offer Jean-Marie’s survival in return
for her own son’s life. Jean-Marie understood this very well, but
it didn’t change in the slightest his gratitude towards this elderly
woman who had nursed him. He did his best to help out, doing odd
jobs around the farm, working in the garden.<br><br>

Though the women sometimes asked him questions about the war,
this war, the men never did. They were all former soldiers (there <b>[p.193]</b> 
weren’t any young men). Their memories remained stuck in ‘14.
They had had time to filter the past, to decant it, to get rid of the
dregs, the poison, to make it bearable for their souls; but recent events
remained confusing and laced with venom. Besides, deep in their
hearts they blamed it all on the youngsters, who weren’t as strong a~
they, weren’t as patient and who’d been spoiled at school. And since
Jean-Marie was young, they tactfully avoided judging him-him and
his contemporaries.<br><br>

This was how everything conspired to comfort and soothe the soldier,
so he could rebuild his strength and courage. He was alone almost
every day; it was the season when there was the most work to do
in the fields. The men left home before dawn. The women looked
after the animals and the washing. Jean-Marie had offered to help but
they’d sent him packing. So he would go outside, crossing the courtyard
where the turkeys were squawking, and walk down to a little
meadow surrounded by a fence where two horses grazed. There was
a golden brown mare and her two little coffee-coloured foals with
their short, rough, dark manes. They would come and rub their muzzles
against their mother’s legs as she nibbled the grass and shook her
tail impatiently to chase away the flies. Every now and again, one of
the foals would turn towards the place near the fence where JeanMane
was lying on the grass, look at him with his dark, moist eyes
and whinny happily. Jean-Marie never grew tired of watching them.
He wanted to write a story about these charming little horses, a story
that would evoke this day in July, this land, this farm, these people,
the war-and himself.<br><br>

He wrote with a chewed-up pencil stub, in a little notebook which
he hid against his heart. He felt he had to hurry: something inside him
was making him anxious, was knocking on an invisible door. By writing,
he opened that door, he gave life to something that wished to be
born. Then suddenly, he would become discouraged, feel disheartened,
weary. He was mad. What was he doing writing these stupid
stories, letting himself be pampered by the farmer’s wife, while his
friends were in prison, his despairing parents thought he was dead,
when the future was so uncertain, the past so bleak? But while he was
thinking these thoughts, he saw one of the foals run joyously towards <b>[p.194]</b> 
him, then roll around in the grass, kicking its hooves in the air and
looking at him with mischievous and tender eyes. He tried to work
out how to describe that look, all the time feeling impatiently curious
and oddly anxious. He couldn’t find the words but he knew what the
little horse must feel, how good the crisp, cool grass must taste, how
annoying the flies were, the sense of pride and freedom when he
raised his muzzle and ran and kicked. He quickly wrote down a few
awkward, unfinished lines. They were no good, he hadn’t captured
the essence, but it would come; he closed the notebook and finally sat
still, hands open in his lap, eyes closed, tired and happy.<br><br>

When he got back at dinnertime, he immediately saw that something
important had happened while he was out. One of the farmhands
had gone into the village to get some bread; now there he was
with four round golden loaves on the handlebars of his bicycle and a
group of women crowding round him. One of the girls saw JeanMane
and shouted, “Hey, Monsieur Michaud! This’ll make you
happy, there’s post again.”<br><br>

“Really?” said Jean-Marie to the old man. “Are you sure?”<br><br>

“Positive. I saw the Post Office open and people reading letters.”<br><br>

“Then I’m going upstairs to write my family a letter and take it to
the village. Will you lend me your bicycle?”<br><br>

In the village, he not only posted his letter but bought the newspapers
which had just arrived. How strange everything was! He was
like a castaway who had made it back to his homeland, civilisation,
society. In the little village square, people were reading letters from
the evening delivery. Some of the women were crying; many prisoners
had sent their news, but had also given the names of friends
who’d been killed. At the farm, they’d asked him to find out if anyone
knew where Benoit was.<br><br>

“Oh, so you’re the soldier living there, are you?” the women
asked. “Well, we have no idea, but now the letters are coming, we’ll
soon find out where our men are!”<br><br>

One of them, an older woman who’d put on a little pointed black
hat with a rose at the front to come down to the village, was crying as
she spoke. “Some of us will find out too soon. I wish I’d never got
this damned piece of paper. My boy was a sailor on the <i>Bretagne</i> and <b>[p.195]</b> 
they say he went missing when the English torpedoed the ship. It’s
just too much!”<br><br>

“Don’t you give up hope. Missing doesn’t mean dead. Maybe he’s
a prisoner in England!”<br><br>

But to all these attempts at consoling her, she just shook her head
and the artificial flower on its brass stem quivered as she trembled.
“No, no, it’s all over, my poor boy! It’s just too much ... “<br><br>

Jean-Marie headed back to the hamlet. At the side of the road he
found Cecile and Madeleine who’d come to meet him; they both
asked at the same time: “You hear anything about my brother?,”
“You hear anything about Benoit?”<br><br>

“No, but that doesn’t mean anything. Can you imagine how many
letters must be backed up waiting to be delivered?”<br><br>

As for their mother, she said nothing. She just shielded her eyes
with her yellowish, dry hand and looked at him; he shook his
head. The soup was on the table, the men were coming home, they
ate. After dinner, when the dishes were dried and the kitchen swept,
Madeleine went into the garden to pick some peas. Jean-Marie followed
her. He knew he would soon be leaving the farm and everything
seemed even more beautiful and peaceful to him.<br><br>

It had been stiflingly hot for several days; you could hardly breathe
until the sun began to set. But this was the time when the garden was
at its most beautiful. The heat had withered the daisies and the white
carnations bordering the kitchen garden, but around the well the rose
bushes were in full bloom; a scent of sugar, musk and honey wafted
up from the clusters of small red roses next to the beehives. The full
moon was the colour of amber, shining so brightly that the sky was
bathed in a soft green light, as far as the eye could see.<br><br>

“What a beautiful summer we’ve had,” said Madeleine. She’d
taken her basket and was walking towards the stakes of green peas.
“Only a week of bad weather at the beginning of the month and
since then, not a drop of rain, not even a cloud, though if it carries on
like this we won’t have any more vegetables ... and it’s hard to work
in this heat; but I don’t care, it’s still nice-as if the heavens have
taken pity on us poor people. You can help if you want to, but you
don’t have to,” she added. <br><br>

<b>[p.196]</b> <br><br>

“What’s Cecile doing?”<br><br>

“Cecile, she’s sewing. She’s making herself a pretty dress to wear
to Mass on Sunday.”<br><br>

Her skilful, strong fingers reached between the cool green leaves
of the peas, broke the stems in half, threw the peas into her basket;
she looked down as she worked. “So you’re going to leave us, then?”<br><br>

“I have to. I’ll be glad to see my parents again and I’ve got to find
some work, but ... “<br><br>

They both went quiet.<br><br>

“Of course, you couldn’t stay here your whole life,” she said,
looking down even more. “Everybody knows that’s how it is, you
meet people, you say goodbye ... “<br><br>

“You say goodbye,” he repeated quietly.<br><br>

“Well, you’re much better now. You’ve got a bit of colour ... “<br><br>

“Thanks to how well you took care of me.”<br><br>

Her hand stopped still under a leaf. “Have you been happy with
us.~ “<br><br>

“You know I have.”<br><br>

“Well, then you better make sure you keep in touch. You should
write ... “ she said, and he saw her eyes full of tears, close to him. She
quickly turned away.<br><br>

“Of course, I’ll write to you, I promise,” said Jean-Marie and gently
touched the young girl’s hand.<br><br>

“Everybody says that ... After you’ve gone, we’ll have time to
think about you here, my God ... Now it’s still the busy season,
we’re working all day long ... but when autumn comes, and winter,
we’ll have nothing to do but look after the animals, and the rest of the
time we’ll just stay indoors and watch the rain fall, then the snow.
Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn’t look for work in town ... “<br><br>

“No, Madeleine, don’t do that, promise me. You’ll be much happier
here.”<br><br>

“You think so?” she murmured, her voice low and strange.<br><br>

And suddenly picking up the basket, she moved slightly away
from him so he couldn’t see her through the leaves. He picked some
peas, lost in thought.<br><br>

“Do you really think I could ever forget you?” he said finally. “Do <b>[p.197]</b> 
you think I have so many happy memories that I could forget this?
Just imagine! The war, the horror, the war.”<br><br>

“But what about before that? You weren’t in the war for ever,
were you? So before, were there ... “<br><br>

“What?”<br><br>

She didn’t reply.<br><br>

“You mean were there women, girls?”<br><br>

“Of course that’s what I mean!”<br><br>

“Nothing very interesting, my dear Madeleine.”<br><br>

“But you’re going away,” she said and finally, without the strength
to hold back her tears, she let them fall down her full cheeks and said
in a voice choking with emotion, “I can’t stand the thought of you
leaving, I can’t. I know I shouldn’t say it, you’ll make fun of me and
Cecile will even more ... but I don’t care ... I can’t bear it ... “<br><br>

“Madeleine ... “<br><br>

She stood up straight, their eyes met. He walked towards her and,
gently putting his arm round her waist, drew her close; when he
started to kiss her, she sighed and pushed him away. “No, that’s not
what I want ... that would be too easy ... “<br><br>

“What do you want, then, Madeleine?” he said. “That I promise
· never to forget you? Whether you believe me or not, that’s the truth.
I will never forget you,” and he took her hand and kissed it; she
blushed with happiness.<br><br>

“Madeleine, is it true you want to become a nun?”<br><br>

“It’s true. Well, I wanted to before, but now ... it’s not that I don’t
love our Good Lord any more, I just think it’s not for me.”<br><br>

“Of course it’s not! You’re meant to love and be happy.”<br><br>

“Happy? I don’t know, but I think I’m meant to have a husband
and children, and if Benoit hasn’t been killed, then ... “<br><br>

“Benoit? I didn’t know ... “<br><br>

“Yes we talked about it ... I didn’t want to. I had this idea of be-
‘ coming a nun. But if he comes back ... he’s a good man ... “<br><br>

“I didn’t know ... “ he said again.<br><br>

How secretive these country people were! Discreet, wary, everything
securely locked up ... like their big wardrobes. He’d lived with
them for two months and had never even suspected there was anything <b>[p.198]</b> 
between Madeleine and the son of the house, and now that he thought
about it, he realised they hardly ever talked about this Benoit . . .
They never talked about anything. But that didn’t mean they weren’t
thinking about it.<br><br>

The farmer’s wife called Madeleine. They went back.<br><br>

Several days passed; there was no news of Benoit but Jean-Marie
soon got a letter and some money from his parents. He was never
alone with Madeleine again. He realised they were being watched. He
said goodbye to the whole family at the door. It was raining that
morning, the first rain in many long weeks; a chilly wind blew in
from the hills. When he was out of sight, the farmer’s wife went back
inside. The two young girls lingered at the door, listening to the
sound of the cart on the road.<br><br>

“Well, it’s not such a bad thing,” exclaimed Cecile, as if she
had made an effort not to say anything for a long time and now let a
rush of words tumble out. “Maybe we’ll get a little work out of you
now ... You’ve had your head in the clouds recently; I’ve had to do
everything ... “<br><br>

“You’ve got no right to criticise me,” Madeleine replied angrily.
“All you did was sew and look at yourself in the mirror ... I’m the
one who got the cows in yesterday and it wasn’t even my turn.”<br><br>

“Well, I don’t know anything about that. It was Mother who told
you to do it.”<br><br>

“Even if Mother told me to do it, I know who gave her the idea.”<br><br>

“Think what you like!”<br><br>

“Hypocrite.”<br><br>

“Hussy! And you want to be a nun ... “<br><br>

“As if <i>you</i> didn’t run around after him. But he couldn’t have cared
less!”<br><br>

“So, and what about you? He’s gone and you’ll never see him
again.”<br><br>

Their eyes burning with rage, they looked at each other for a
moment, then suddenly a surprised, soft expression came over
Madeleine’s face.<br><br>

“Oh, Cecile! We used to be like sisters ... We never fought like
this before ... It isn’t worth it, come on. We can’t have him, either of <b>[p.199]</b> 
us!” She put her arm round Cecile, who started crying. “It’ll pass,
come on, it’ll pass ... Dry your eyes. Mother will see you’ve been
crying.”<br><br>

“Oh, Mother ... she knows everything but says nothing.”<br><br>

They let go of each other; one went over to the stables and the
other went inside the house. It was Monday, washing day, and they
hardly had the chance to say two words to each other, but from their
expressions, their smiles, it was clear they had made up. The wind
blew the smoke from the laundry boiler towards the barn. It was one
of those dark, stormy days in the middle of August when you can
smell the first breath of autumn in the air.<br><br>

Madeleine didn’t have time to think as she washed, wrung out and
rinsed the clothes, and so she managed to put aside her pain. When
she looked up, she saw the grey sky, the trees battered by the storm.
“You’d think summer was over ... “ she said.<br><br>

“Not before time. Filthy summer,” her mother replied resentfully.
Madeleine looked at her, surprised, then remembered the war, the
mass exodus, Benoit gone, the universal misery, the war still going on
far away and so many people who had died. She went back to work in
silence.<br><br>

That evening, she had just shut the chickens away and was hurrying
across the yard in the rain when she saw a man on the road walk-
1 ing quickly towards her. Her heart began pounding; she thought
Jean-Marie had come back. A kind of wild joy shot through her. She
rushed towards him, then let out a cry: “Benoit?”<br><br>

“Yes, it’s me all right,” he said.<br><br>

“But how ... Oh, your mother will be so happy ... Did you escape,
Benoit? We were afraid you were taken prisoner.”<br><br>

He laughed to himself. He was a large young man with a broad,
brown face and daring eyes.<br><br>

“I was, but not for long!”<br><br>

“You escaped?”<br><br>

“Yes.”<br><br>

“But how?”<br><br>

“Well, with my friends.”<br><br>

And suddenly she became a shy country girl once more, with that <b>[p.200]</b> 
ability~lost with Jean-Marie-to love and suffer in silence. She
didn’t ask him anything, she just walked alongside him without saying
a word.<br><br>

“And how’s everything here?” he asked.<br><br>

“Fine.”<br><br>

“Nothing new?”<br><br>

“No, nothing,” she said.<br><br>

And leaping up the first three of the steps into the kitchen, she
went inside the house and called out, “Mother, come quick, it’s
Benoit! Benoit’s come home!”<br><br>


<b>[p.201]</b> <br><br>

<h2>31</h2><br><br>

The preceding winter-the first of the war-had been long and
hard. But what of the winter of 1940-1? The end of November saw
the beginning of the cold and snow. It fell on the houses destroyed by
the bombs, on the bridges they were trying to rebuild, on the Paris
streets where there were no cars or buses, where women in fur coats
and wool hoods hurried by, where other women shivered and huddled
in doorways. It fell on the railway tracks and on the telegraph
wires, which were sometimes dragged to the ground by the weight
and snapped; on the green uniforms of the German soldiers standing
at the entrance to their barracks and on the red flags with their
swastikas draped over the monuments. In freezing apartments, it cast
a mournful, deathly pallor that made everything feel even cold er and
more inhospitable. In the poorer families, the old people and children
stayed in bed for weeks: it was the only place they could be warm.<br><br>

That winter, Gabriel Corte’s terrace was covered in a thick layer
of snow; he and Florence put the champagne out there to chill. Corte
would write sitting next to the fire, which still didn’t quite manage to
replace the lost heat of the radiators. His nose was blue; he could
have cried from the cold. With one hand he held a piping hot-water
bottle against his chest; with the other he wrote.<br><br>

At Christmas the cold became even fiercer; only in the Metro
could you warm up a little. And still the relentless snow fell-softly,
cruelly-on the trees along the Boulevard Delessert where the
Pericands had come back to live (for they belonged to the French
upper middle class who would prefer to see their children with no
bread, no meat, no air rather than no education, and under no circumstances
would they interrupt Hubert’s studies, already so damaged
by the terrible events of the past summer, nor Bernard’s, who <b>[p.202]</b> 
was nearly nine and had forgotten everything he’d learned before the
exodus and was forced by his mother to recite “The earth is a sphere
which sits on absolutely nothing” as if he were seven instead of
eight-what a disaster!).<br><br>

Snowflakes gathered on Madame Pericand’s black mourning veil
as she marched proudly past the long queues of customers in front of
the shop, stopping at the entrance to wave like a flag the priority ration
card given to large families.<br><br>

In the snow, Jeanne and Maurice Michaud waited their turn, leaning
against each other like weary horses during a short pause in their
journey.<br><br>

The snow covered Charlie Langelet’s grave at the Pere-Lachaise
cemetery, the piles of wrecked cars near the Gien bridge-and all the
shelled, burned-out, abandoned vehicles left along the roads in June,
tilted over on one wheel or on their side, or ripped open, or nothing
more than a twisted mass of steel. The countryside was white, endless,
silent. Only after several days did the snow melt; the country
folk were delighted. “It’s good to see the earth again,” they said. But
the next day it snowed again and the crows screeched in the skies.
“There’s a lot of snow this year,” the young people murmured,
thinking of the battlefields, the towns that had been bombed. But the
older people replied, “No more than usual!” In the countryside nothing
changed, everyone just waited. They waited for the war to end,
for the blockade to be lifted, for the prisoners to come home, for the
end of winter.<br><br>

“There won’t be any spring this year,” the women sighed as
February passed, then the beginning of March and still it got no
warmer. The snow had disappeared, but the earth was grey and as
hard as iron. The potatoes froze. The animals had nothing to eat.
They should have been put out to pasture by now, but there wasn’t a
single blade of grass in sight. In the Sabaries’ hamlet, the old people
shut themselves away behind their great wooden doors, which they
nailed shut at night. The family huddled round the stove, knitting for
the prisoners, without saying a word. Madeleine and Cécile were
making little nightshirts and nappies out of old sheets: Madeleine had
married Benoit in September and was expecting a baby. When a harsh <b>[p.203]</b> 
gust of wind shook the door, the old women would say, “Ah, dear
God, it’s just too much!”<br><br>

At the neighbouring farm a baby was crying. He’d been born just
before Christmas and his father was a prisoner of war. His mother already
had three other children. She was a tall, thin countrywoman,
modest, reserved, who never complained. When people asked her,
“How are you going to manage, Louise, with no man at home, with
all the work, no one to help you and four children?” her eyes would
be sad and cold, but she would smile faintly and reply, “I have no
choice ... “ In the evening, when the children were asleep, she would
go round to the Sabaries and sit down with her knitting, next to the
door so she could hear if her children called her through the silent
darkness. When no one was looking she would secretly watch
Madeleine with her young husband, without envy, without malice,
but in silent sorrow; then she would quickly look back down at her
work. After a quarter of an hour she would get up, put on her shoes
and say quietly, “Well, I’d better get going. Goodnight, goodbye
everyone,” and go home. It was a March evening. She couldn’t sleep.
It was the same almost every night when she tried to fall asleep in the
cold, empty bed. She had thought about having her eldest child sleep
with her, but a kind of superstitious fear prevented her: that place had
to be saved for her absent husband.<br><br>

On this particular night, a violent wind was blowing as a storm
from the Morvan mountains swept over the village. “There’ll be
more snow tomorrow!” everyone said. In her large, silent house that
creaked like a ship adrift at sea, the woman couldn’t bear it any more
and, for the very first time, burst into tears. She hadn’t cried when her
husband had left in ‘39, nor when he’d said goodbye after his few
days home on leave, nor when she’d found out he’d been taken prisoner,
nor when she’d given birth all alone. But she just couldn’t bear
it any more: so much work to do ... the baby was so big and wore her
out with his feeding and crying ... the cow hardly gave any milk because
it was so cold ... the chickens had nothing to eat and weren’t
laying any eggs ... in the wash-house she had to break the ice ... It
was all too much. She just couldn’t do it any more-it was making
her ill. She had lost the will to live ... What was the point of living? <b>[p.204]</b> 
She would never see her husband again. They missed each other so
much; at that moment he was probably dying in Germany. It was so
cold in that big bed.<br><br>

She reached for the warming stone, which a few hours ago had
been burning hot but was now icy cold, took it out from under the
sheets and set it gently down on the floor. As her hand touched the
freezing tiles, she felt an even icier chill run straight through her
heart. She was sobbing violently. What could anyone say to ease her
pain? “You’re not the only one ... “ She knew that only too well
but other people seemed to be lucky ... Madeleine Sabarie, for example
... She didn’t wish her harm ... It was just too much! Life was
too painful. Her thin body was frozen. It did her no good to huddle
under the eiderdown, she felt the cold seeping right down to her
bones. “It will pass, he’ll come home and the war will be over!” people
would say. No. She didn’t believe it any more. No. It would go on
and on and on ... Ev~n spring didn’t seem to want to come ... Had
there ever been such terrible weather in March? March was nearly
over and the ground was still frozen, frozen to the core, like her. Such
harsh winds! Just listen to them! They would surely blow the tiles off
the roof.<br><br>

She sat up in bed and listened for a moment. A look of mild surprise
suddenly passed across her sad, tear-stained face. The wind had
stopped. Just as it had come out of nowhere, so it had now disappeared
without a trace. It had broken branches off the trees, whipped
the rooftops in its blind rage, carried away the last of the snow on the
hill, and now, out of the dark sky devastated by the storm, the first
rain of spring began to fall, still cold, but torrential and urgent, carving
its way down to the smallest roots of the trees, down to the very
heart of the deep, black earth.
