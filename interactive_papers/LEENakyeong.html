			case 5: $("div#commentary").html(' Selections about “<b>Nazism</b>” from Max Hastings, <i>Inferno: The World at War, 1939-1945</i>(2011)<br><br>“Most French people persuaded themselves in 1940 that the Petain
regime constituted a lawful government; however uncomfortably, they
indulged its rule until the eve of liberation. Once defeat in 1940 had denied
the French a heroic role in the struggle against Nazism, many remained
confused for the remainder of the war about the least ignoble part their
nation might play. After the liberation in 1944, France indulged in an
orgy of domestic recrimination, reflecting rancour about the 1940 defeat,
together with a settling of national and local accounts between former
collaborationists and resisters which prompted several thousand killings
during l’ipuration-the purification, as it was ironically known. Forrest
Pogue wrote after a visit to Paris, ‘I soon found that the old bitterness
against Jews and labor remained.’ Communist factions emerged from the
war strengthened in France, as also in Italy and Greece, and for some
years there were fears for the survival of democracy in all three countries.
Bourgeois capitalism eventually prevailed, but political stability proved
slow to achieve.” (637, from Forrest Pogue, <i>The Pogue’s War</i>[2001], 202)<br><br>“The Western Allies advanced through Germany in the same measured
fashion in which they had conducted their campaign since October 1944.
They sought to complete the destruction of Nazism at acceptable human
cost, advancing to the lines of occupation agreed with the Russians, and
only temporarily and in a few areas beyond them. The Germans continued
to resist, but few displayed the fanaticism that characterised the eastern
battle to the end. The hard part, for the vanquished, was to identify
an opportunity to quit without being shot by one side or the other.” (585)<br><br>“Apologists for the British and American armies assert that respect for
the German defence of Sicily, like many other Axis battlefield achievements,
cannot mask its ultimate failure. Kesselring’s forces were evicted
from the island. They lost. This is true, and important. It is among the
themes of this book that the Wehrmacht fought many battles brilliantly
well, but that Germany made war very badly. Nonetheless, repeated AngloAmerican
failures to destroy Hitler’s armies, despite successes in displacing
them from occupied territory, meant that the Red Army remained until
1945, as it had been since 1941, the main engine of Nazism’s destruction.” (436)'); break;

	<p><b>Aime Cesaire, <i>Discourse on Colonialism</i> (1955)</b><br>
<br><p>And since I have been asked to speak about colonization and civilization, let us go straight to the principal lie which is the source of all the others.</p></br>
<p>Colonization and civilization?</p><br>
<p>[ . . . ] [T]he essential thing here is to see clearly, to think clearly –that is, dangerously –and to answer clearly the innocent first question: what, fundamentally, is colonization? To on what it is not: neither evangelization, nor a philanthropic enterprise, nor a desire to push back the frontiers of ignorance, disease, and tyranny, nor a project undertaken for the greater glory of God, nor an attempt to extend the rule of law. To admit once and for all, without flinching at the consequences, that the decisive actors here are the adventurer and the pirate, the wholesale grocer and the ship owner, the gold digger and the merchant, appetite and force, and behind them, the baleful projected shadow of a form of civilization which, at a certain point in its history, finds itself obliged, for internal reasons, to extend to a world scale the competition of its antagonistic economies.</p><br>
<p>Pursuing my analysis, I find that hypocrisy is of recent date [ . . . ]That the chief culprit in this domain is Christian pedantry, which laid down the dishonest equations <i>Christianity = civilization, paganism= savagery</i>, from which there could not but ensue abominable colonialist and racist consequences, whose victims were to be the Indians, the yellow peoples, and the Negroes.</p><br>
<p>That being settled, I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilizations in contact with each other; that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever its own particular genius may be, a civilization that withdraws into itself atrophies, that for civilizations, exchange is oxygen; that the great good fortune of Europe is to have been a crossroads, and that because it was the locus of all ideas, the receptacle of all philosophies, the meeting place of all sentiments, it was the best center for the redistribution of energy.</p><br>
<p>But then I ask the following question: has colonization really <i>placed civilization in contact?</i> Or, if you prefer, of all the ways of <i>establishing contact</i>, was it the best?</p>
<br><p>I answer no.</p>
<br><p>And I say that between <i>colonization</i> and <i>civilization</i> there is an infinite distance; that out of all the colonial expeditions that have been undertaken, out of all the colonial statues that have been drawn up, out of all the memoranda that have been dispatched by all the ministries, there could not come a single human value.</p>
<br><p>First we must study how colonization works to <i>decivilize</i> the colonizer, to <i>brutalize</i> him in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to covetousness, violence, race hatred, moral relativism; and we must show that each time [ . . . ] a Madagascaran is tortured and in France they accept the fact, civilization acquires another dead weight, a universal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a center of infection begins to spread; and that at the end . . . a poison has been instilled into the veins of Europe and, slowly but surely, the continent proceeds toward <i>savagery</i>.</p>
<br><p>And then one fine day the bourgeoisie is awakened by a terrific reverse shock: the gestapos are busy, the prisons fill up, the torturers around the racks invent, refine, discuss.</p>
<br><p>People are surprised, they become indignant. They say: “How strange! But never mind –it’s Nazism, it will pass!” And they wait, and they hope; and they hide the truth from themselves that it is barbarism, but the supreme barbarism, the crowning barbarism that sums up all the daily barbarisms; that it is Nazism, yes, but that before they were its victims, they were its accomplices; that they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, that they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples; that they have cultivated that Nazism, that they are responsible for it, and that before engulfing the whole of Western, Christian civilization in its reddened waters, it oozes, seeps, and trickles from every crack.</p>
<br><p>Yes, it would be worthwhile to study clinically, in detail, the steps taken by Hitler and Hitlerism and to reveal to the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian bourgeois of the twentieth century that without his being aware of it, he has a Hitler inside him, that Hitler <i>inhabits</i> him, that Hitler is his <i>demon</i>, that if he rails against him, he is being inconsistent and that, at bottom, what he cannot forgive Hitler is not <i>crime</i> in itself, <i>the crime against man</i>, it is not <i>the humiliation of man as such</i>, it is the crime against the white man, the humiliation of the white man, and the fact that Hitler applied to Europe colonialist procedures which until then had been reserved exclusively for the Arabs of Algeria, the coolies of India, and the blacks of Africa.</p>
