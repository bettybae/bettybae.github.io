Early in life, Abetz was attracted by French culture. Starting in 1930, he helped organize Franco–German youth meetings, where in 1932 he met French journalist Jean Luchaire, whose secretary he married. Abetz became a member of the Nazi Party in 1937 and a specialist in French affairs.

On 5 January 1942, Abetz met with Hitler and Ribbentrop to attempt to form a Franco–German military alliance, which, however, failed. After the Allied landings in North Africa and the German occupation of the southern zone, Abetz was recalled to Berlin in December 1942 and requested to abandon all diplomatic action with France. Following an attempt by Pétain to recall the National Assembly, Abetz returned to Vichy in December 1943, the bearer of a letter from Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop reproaching Pétain for his “resistance” to the Germans and demanding the appointment of more dedicated collaborationists to the Vichy government. Following the liberation, Abetz accompanied the retreating Vichy supporters and collaborators to Sigmaringen, where he was finally dismissed as ambassador in December 1944. <br><br> Sentenced to 20 years’ hard labor by a Paris military court in 1949, Abetz was released 5 years later.

			case 102: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ACTION FRANÇAISE (1899–1944),</b> nationalist and royalist movement of the extreme Right, influential in shaping the early phase of Vichy’s National Revolution. Led by Charles Maurras and spearheaded by its daily newspaper, <i>L’Action Française</i>, the movement became the avant-garde of the French nationalist Right in the decade before 1914. Mixing violent polemics and street brawling with serious political and literary commentary, the Action Française’s influence peaked in the years just after World War I, when its brand of nationalism was widely shared. Between the mid-1920s and the eve of World War II, the movement suffered a long, but gradual, period of decline hastened, first, by the Vatican’s condemnation in 1926, resulting in loss of Catholic support, and, second, by the steady defection of younger and more activist recruits to the radical leagues of the 1930s. However, the long-term impact of Maurrasian ideas proved to be significant, not only among the many “dissidents” who populated the more radical leagues of the 1930s but also across the spectrum of the nationalist Right. <br><br> Though the Action Française had been, from its earliest days, vehemently anti-German, by the late 1930s, it had become a leading force in the neopacifist campaign, culminating with its support of the Munich agreement. This paradox can be explained in terms of the alignment of ideological forces, both inside and outside France. Though Maurras had little sympathy for Nazism—which he saw as a variety of despised “Germanism”—he had even less sympathy for those who, he claimed, would benefit from a war against Hitler: the Soviet Union, French communists and their Popular Front allies, and Jews. Although the Action Française opposed the dreaded “ideological” war to the last day, when it was finally declared, the royalists supported its prosecution. The defeat of 1940, which brought in its wake the dismantling of the parliamentary Republic and the installation of Philippe Pétain as head of an authoritarian regime, seemed, at first, to open a new and promising phase in the movement’s history. Though the impact of the Action Française on Vichy’s National Revolution has sometimes been exaggerated, it was real, specifically because of the number of well-placed Maurrasians close to Pétain and, more generally, because Maurrasian ideas had had a shaping influence on the Catholic and reactionary Right through the years of the Third Republic. The laws, institutions, and moral tone of the Vichy government reflected long-standing royalist preferences: from the anti-Semitic laws to the emphasis on the ideals of order, hierarchy, corporation, and authority. Even though the royalist daily, published in Lyons, often criticized the slow pace of the National Revolution and its lax enforcement, it stood unwaveringly behind the figure of Pétain. This benefited the royalists early on, when Pétain’s popularity was almost universal; however, as his National Revolution proved increasingly hollow, and his decision to collaborate with the Nazi occupier increasingly disastrous, the Action Française, supporting its surrogate prince to the end, shared in the increasing disfavor directed against his government. Further, the Action Française’s habitually vicious attacks on selected groups and individuals—now focused on communists, Gaullists, and Jews—became, in some cases, tantamount to death sentences as officials, both German and French, hunted down their prey. Hence, when the Vichy regime went down in the flames of the Nazi defeat, the Action Française shared its fate. <br><br> *F.

			case 103: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ALLIANCE</b> was a network of the British Intelligence Service, or IS (MI6), founded by Georges Loustanau-Lacau, 1 February 1941. Mentioned five times in army dispatches during World War I and engaged in right-wing conspiracies within the army in the 1930s, Loustanau-Lacau was well acquainted with Marshal Pétain. Having come to Vichy after his escape on 15 August 1940 from the hospital at Châlons-sur-Marne, where he had been prisoner of war, he was named general delegate of the Légion Française des Combattants. <br><br> At Vichy, using the pseudonym “Navarre” and with the help of Marie- Madeleine Méric (later, Fourcade), he reconstituted his interwar army network, the “Corvignolles,” which he lodged in the Hotel des Sports in Vichy. As general delegate of the Légion, in October 1940, Loustanau-Lacau recruited a first group of 10 trustworthy men who organized passages into the occupied zone and then, in the other direction, into the southern zone. The group became Alliance, part of the non-Gaullist Resistance, and worked in close collaboration with the “Groupes de protection” led by Colonel Georges Groussard in Vichy. Loustanau-Lacau and Léon Faye were arrested 18 July 1941; consequently, leadership of the network returned to Méric, who reconstituted it in the occupied zone beginning in the spring of 1942. The network now specialized in the search for military information in France and North Africa. In October 1942, the network liquidated a traitorous infiltrator from within the IS: a certain Blanchet, a member of the British fascist movement of Oswald Mosley, had infiltrated the IS with the help of the Germans. <br><br> The real nerve center of the Giraud affair, Alliance organized the departure of Giraud for North Africa in November. Throughout the duration of the war, the network Alliance operated independently with the services of the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d’Action, with which it made first contact in 1944. In all, Alliance functioned with some 3,000 agents, 100 transmitting stations, and an air liaison with London each month. <br><br> M.-M. Fourcade, <i>Noah’s Ark</i>, trans. K.

At the Casablanca Conference (January 1943), Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to establish an Allied interservice staff to prepare a plan for the invasion of the continent in 1944, Operation Overlord. The British 21st Army Group and First U.S. Army Group would spearhead the invasion, with General Dwight D. Eisenhower as supreme allied commander (SAC) and Generals Sir Bernard Montgomery and Omar Bradley leading the respective army groups. SHAEF was caught in the middle of Allied arguments about the political future of France: AMGOT (Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories) or recognition of local French authority, and there was still confusion on the eve of the landings, with arguments between the Allies and the French on a number of issues. <br><br> The Normandy landings, supported by the invasion of southern France (Operation Anvil), in August 1944, not only liberated France but provided an acceptance “on the ground” of French authorities, well in advance of the official position of the Allied governments. In August 1944 Paris was liberated, with Eisenhower departing from original SHAEF plans, which had been to skirt the city in the drive toward Germany. <br><br> When official recognition of the Provisional Government (GPRF) came in October 1944, SHAEF had already accepted, on the ground, the establishment of French authorities. With the campaign in Germany, SHAEF was prepared to support the French government to maintain order in the rear of army operations. <br><br> F.

			case 105: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ALLIED MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (AMGOT)</b> was a system devised for administration of territories that came under military control in the course of liberating Western Europe. The policy was applied in Sicily and parts of mainland Italy, but the threat of AMGOT in France led to sharp disagreements between the United States and the Free French. The Americans established special schools that offered French language, history, and politics courses on college campuses, notably the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. Under AMGOT these civil affairs officers (“90-day wonders”) would administer liberated territory. However, AMGOT was never applied on French territory, despite Roosevelt’s insistence that the military commander had the right to establish a military government. In North Africa Eisenhower’s civil affairs officers provided liaison between the military and French officials but did not govern. <br><br> Although AMGOT had been abandoned by the beginning of 1944, the threat of an occupation government for France remained a concern for the Gaullists on the eve of D-Day. Roosevelt authorized American officials to print French currency to be distributed upon landing in Normandy. De Gaulle objected that this action usurped French sovereignty, declared the Allied francs to be “counterfeit,” and refused to allow French liaison officers to participate in the landings. After bitter negotiations, the occupation currency was abandoned, and Eisenhower urged rapid transfer of administration to officials of the Provisional Government. Despite disputes at the highest levels, cooperation between Allied civil affairs officers and French authorities was generally successful, but AMGOT remains a Gaullist memory of American high-handedness. <br><br> H.

			case 106: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ALSACE-LORRAINE.</b> With the beginning of the war, on 1 September 1939, 230,000 Lorrainers and 275,000 Alsatians (including all of the residents of Strasbourg) were evacuated to southwestern France. Leaders of the various regional autonomist factions were rounded up and imprisoned at Nancy. The most compromised among them, Karl Roos, an agent of the German Sicherheitsdienst (security service, SD) was convicted of high treason and shot on 7 February 1940. <br><br> During the campaign of 1940, the Maginot Line forts stood firm, some holding out until the end of June, long after the armistice. Five days after the French artillery supporting the line was withdrawn, the German Seventh Army crossed the Rhine: Metz and Strasbourg fell on 17 and 19 June. The entire French bureaucracy in the three <i>départements </i>was arrested and expelled immediately. Operating on the lie that a secret clause in the armistice of 25 June had transferred control of Alsace and Lorraine from France to Germany, the Nazis promptly integrated the region into their own pre-1939 frontier districts. The Gauleiters (local leaders) were two party veterans, Joseph Bürckel for Westmark and Robert Wagner (né Backfisch) for Baden-Elsass. Despite a vigorous protest by Vichy delegates to the armistice commission at the end of August, the Germans continued their de facto incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine. The proceedings of the commission were secret, and the protest was not known in the region until mid-1941. Meanwhile, the belief that France had deliberately abandoned Alsace-Lorraine to its fate took root. <br><br> The first two years of German occupation were spent in applying the Nazi institutions to Alsace-Lorraine. The sharp loss in inhabitants through mass deportation (to unoccupied France or, in aggravated cases, “to the East”) was partially made up by the return of the evacuees from Périgord. The second period, from mid-1942 to liberation at the end of November 1944, was that of rupture between occupier and the indigenous population. The Nazis had promised in 1940 that Alsace-Lorraine would never have to fight in the ongoing war. Suddenly, the conscription of all males between the ages of 16 and 34 was decreed on 25 August 1942. A whole new class was created overnight: the <i>Malgré-Nous </i>(Against Our Will). Despite riots and widespread defiance, 105,000 Alsatians and 35,000 Lorrainers went to the eastern front, of whom some 40,000 never returned. [Editor’s note: estimates of the numbers of Alsatians and Lorrainers killed vary because of the difficult immediate postwar conditions in France and the reluctance of the Soviet Union to supply information after 1945; see Autonomists.] <br><br> The development and extension of Resistance cells and networks in Alsace- Lorraine kept pace with the increasing repression. Many escaped to Switzerland, the most notable being General Henri Giraud in April 1942. Liberation came when General Philippe Leclerc, leading his own French Second Armored Division and three American infantry units, cracked the central Vosges defenses on 22 November 1944. The following day, his forces quickly liberated Strasbourg and the territories extending north to the Palatinate and south to the outskirts of Colmar. As General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny’s First French Army entered Mulhouse at the same time, the war seemed over, although a southern feint in the desperate German counterattack in the Ardennes nearly recaptured Strasbourg. <br><br> Alsace-Lorraine was quickly purged of collaborators: the number of death sentences was the highest in liberated France, but more commutations were also handed down because of the “special circumstances” of German rule in the region. Adjustment to renewed French rule was complicated by popular resentment over the apparent abandonment by the Vichy regime and by the involvement of several adolescent <i>Malgré-Nous </i>in the 1944 massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane. The nightmare of occupation, however, had underscored the pricelessness of the political freedom for which the French Republic, whatever its faults, had always stood. <br><br> *P. C. F.

Holding Jews to blame for the “decadence” of the Third Republic and for dragging France into war, Vichy authorities acted independently of the Germans to deprive Jews of their civil liberties and cooperated with the Germans in the confiscation of Jewish property and the internment and deportation of Jews from France. The <i>Statut des Juifs </i>of 3 October 1940 prohibited Jews from holding positions of authority in the military, the civil service, education, and the press. Subsequent laws, including a second <i>Statut des Juifs </i>in June 1941, extended these prohibitions and restricted Jewish access to higher education and the liberal professions. As of June 1941, Jews could constitute no more than 3 percent of all secondary and postsecondary education students and no more than 2 percent of lawyers (July 1941), doctors, midwives, and pharmacists (August 1941), architects (September 1941), and dentists (June 1942). Administration of these initiatives was the responsibility of the Commissariat générale des questions juives (CGQJ), established in March 1941. <br><br> A German ordinance of 18 October 1940 required that all but the smallest Jewish businesses in the occupied zone be placed under trusteeship. Vichy responded by creating the Service de contrôle des administrateurs provisoires (SCAP) to guarantee that French trustees assume responsibility for managing, selling, or liquidating Jewish property. A law of 2 July 1941 extended the Aryanization of Jewish property to the unoccupied zone. Unemployment and the Aryanization of Jewish property created widespread Jewish impoverishment. Jewish philanthropic organizations attempted to meet the needs of destitute Jews independently but were thwarted by the Germans and Vichy, which in November 1941 created the Union générale des Israélites de France (UGIF). Subsumed under the authority of the CGQJ and responsible for the social welfare of Jews resident in France, the UGIF had to register all Jews resident in the occupied zone and supervise the internment of Jews in concentration camps throughout France. <br><br> As of 4 October 1940 Vichy had the authority to intern foreign-born Jews; three days later it revoked the citizenship of Algerian Jews. Within weeks there were 50,000 Jews interned in concentration camps throughout France and in North Africa. On 2 June 1941 Vichy authorized the internment of any Jew, whether foreign-born or French. After the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 determined how many Jews each region of occupied Europe would have to deport to extermination camps, the German occupation authorities in France demanded that Vichy cooperate in the arrest and deportation of 100,000 Jews. After 29 May 1942, Jews over the age of six residing in the occupied zone had to wear the yellow star; by midsummer they were denied access to most public places, allowed to ride only on the last car on the Métro, and forced to shop only during designated hours. The ordinance requiring Jews to wear the yellow star and the arrest of 12,884 Jews, rounded up in the Vélodrome d’hiver, a bicycle-race stadium, in Paris on 16–17 July 1942 provoked civil and religious protests throughout France. Nonetheless, by the end of 1942, 42,500 Jews (including 6,000 children) had been deported. On 11 December 1942 Vichy required all Jews to carry identification papers stamped “Juif.” Because Jews in the previously unoccupied zone were not required to wear the yellow star, in 1943, when the Gestapo boarded trains and raided cities in the south of France in search of Jews, the identification papers helped them to find their quarry. Although Pierre Laval refused to cooperate when Germany demanded that France revoke the citizenship of Jews naturalized since 1927, Vichy did little else to impede the Final Solution. Of the 75,721 Jews deported from France, two-thirds were foreign-born, who had sought refuge in France; one-third were French citizens. Only 2,500 (3 percent) of the deportees survived. <br><br> *†J.

			case 108: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ARMISTICE, FRANCO–GERMAN,</b> signed at Compiègne on 22 June 1940 and entering into effect on 25 June, ended for a time France’s participation in the Second World War after its decisive military defeat by the invading German armies. The armistice was signed at Hitler’s insistence in the same railway car in which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had signed a previous armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. <br><br> Marshal Philippe Pétain, who replaced Paul Reynaud as prime minister on 16 June while the French armies retreated in disarray, and the French government was fleeing southward, sued for an armistice less than six weeks after the German offensive against the Low Countries and France. A handful of military officers and political leaders contemplated continuing the war from French North Africa or from the British Isles. The vast majority of the demoralized French population, however, who recalled the fate of Warsaw and other Polish cities after the earlier German Blitzkrieg, dreaded the consequences of further Resistance and eagerly accepted the armistice. Most French people assumed at the time that Britain would capitulate within weeks and therefore concluded that a fight to the finish was both futile and suicidal. Some on the Right feared a repetition of the Franco–Prussian War of 1870–1871, when, in their view, French Resistance to a German invasion had resulted in a revolution in Paris. Taken by surprise by the unexpectedly swift collapse of the French army, Hitler, apart from ideas about a future French–German border that returned Alsace-Lorraine to Germany, had neither planned for an armistice nor for the occupation of France and had to improvise many of the terms that were incorporated in the armistice agreement. The original provisions of the 1940 Franco– German armistice were not terribly harsh. French military forces were disarmed, the northern three-fifths of the country (including the coasts of the Atlantic, the English Channel, and North Sea) was subjected to German military occupation, and the unoccupied zone was left entirely under the jurisdiction of the soon-tobe- created Vichy regime. France was required to pay occupation costs under Article 18 at the subsequently agreed-upon rate of 400 million francs a day (based on a highly unfavorable exchange rate). The French government was permitted to retain custody of the French fleet interned at the Mediterranean port of Toulon and to exercise sovereignty over France’s empire overseas. The Germans subsequently obtained much more substantial advantages than those specified in the original armistice agreement through negotiations with the Vichy government representatives on the armistice commission at Wiesbaden. They gained access to French manufactured goods, raw materials, and labor for the German war effort as well as the de facto incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into the Reich. <br><br> The degree to which the armistice and its consequences helped the German war effort has been debated, with some pointing to the avenging of the 1918 defeat, the reduction of French power, the French economic resources obtained by the Germans for their war effort, and the apparent free hand the Germans now had in ultimately arranging the interrelated continental and colonial claims of France, Italy, Belgium, and Holland in a potential final settlement. Others have suggested that in signing the armistice that left an unhappy France still a sovereign power with an empire and a navy, the Germans committed themselves to a continuing war in the west when a more generous settlement with the French might have freed German resources for the subsequent campaign against Soviet Russia. It has been argued that by signing the armistice, the Germans stopped their own forward drive at a time when Spain might have joined them in a successful campaign to take Gibraltar, move into North Africa, and close the Mediterranean while Britain was too weak to react. According to this argument, the halting of the German advance also allowed time to establish the legitimacy of the Free French in London. Invasion plans against France had been changed no fewer than 29 times between the defeat of Poland in September 1939 and the actual attack in the west in May 1940. When informed of the armistice arrangements in June, General Franz Halder, the head of the German Army General Staff, complained in his diary of “dilettante interference” in military planning. Only on 30 June was a plan (Felix) developed, to conquer French North Africa. Hitler’s own second thoughts regarding the armistice were reflected in his December 1940 signing of the order for Operation Attila, a plan to occupy the zone that the armistice had left unoccupied. <br><br> In November 1942 the distinction between the occupied and unoccupied zones as specified in the armistice agreement was erased when the German army did invade the southern zone in response to the Allied military landings in French North Africa. After the liberation, Pétain’s supporters justified the prompt quest for an armistice in June 1940 on the grounds that by ending the fighting the marshal had spared France the wholesale destruction of property and loss of life that they claimed would have resulted from continued resistance within or beyond France’s frontiers. His critics who had rallied to the cause of the Free French movement of Charles de Gaulle denounced the conditions of the armistice for laying the groundwork for Franco–German collaboration. <br><br> *J.-P.

The Battle of France in the spring 1940 split French forces, with some 110,000 French troops being ferried to Britain in the withdrawal from Dunkirk. Many of these troops eventually joined General de Gaulle’s Free French. <br><br> The 1940 armistice imposed a limit of 100,000 men on the metropolitan (Vichy) force, divided into eight divisions and complemented by an equivalent number in the colonies. This armistice army, poorly equipped, was dissolved in November 1942, when the Germans moved into the southern zone. Some of the demobilized men then joined either the internal Resistance or Fighting France (FFI). The latter, structured along the lines of British-type brigades, participated in the campaigns of Ethiopia (1941), Fezzan (1941–1942), Syria (1941), and Libya (1942). <br><br> Following the Allied landing in North Africa, the Comité français de libération nationale gained control over the French forces stationed overseas, including 217,000 men in Africa. Soon after, several infantry divisions were formed and engaged on the Tunisian front. With the assistance of the United States, a new Corps expéditionaire français was constituted (based in part on the previous Armée A). It participated successfully in the Italian campaign between January and June 1944. Meanwhile the Armée B, composed of seven tank divisions, landed in Provence in August 1944 (it was renamed First French Army on 7 October). Another group, the second tank division under General Leclerc, landed in Normandy and participated in the liberation of Paris. <br><br> After the liberation of the French capital, the Gouvernement provisoire de la République française incorporated the FFI and the colonial troops into a new French army under the Plan du 30 novembre 1944.

Despite his desire to fight, Sergeant Aron was drafted as a meteorologist. After the fall of France, having just lost his mother and having left his wife and small daughter in Toulouse, Aron, determined to continue to fight Nazism, left on a British boat from St. Jean de Luz.<br><br> In London, he joined the small force of the Free French, where he served briefly—and frustratingly—as an accountant. One of General de Gaulle’s aides, André Labarthe (who was to become bitterly anti-Gaullist later on), persuaded him to write for a new monthly, <i>La France libre</i>. Throughout the war years, Aron published strategic and political analyses, which were later collected in several volumes, especially <i>L’homme contre les tyrans </i>and <i>De l’armistice a` l’insurrection nationale</i>. The main features of these essays were their unfailing lucidity, their faith in final victory and in France, and their moderation in the analysis of the situation in France. <br><br> Aron found the Vichy regime’s policies more foolish than treasonable and did not hesitate to criticize the abrupt and intensely personal style of General de Gaulle—two factors that alienated him, if not from the general himself, at least from de Gaulle’s entourage. As a Jew, he felt inhibited from focusing on Vichy’s anti-Semitic policies, an attitude he later deplored. His wife and daughter finally reached Britain in July 1943. They stayed in London (with a second daughter, born in 1944) until June 1945. Aron himself had returned to liberated Paris in September 1944. He decided not to go back to academe, partly out of bitterness about the exclusion of Jews from higher education under Vichy and partly because of his “ambition to take part in national debates” and public service. He chose journalism. With his classmate and friend from the École Normale, Jean-Paul Sartre, Aron founded the review <i>Les temps modernes </i>in the fall of 1945. In November 1945 he joined the staff (cabinet) of André Malraux, minister of information in de Gaulle’s government.

Paintings and other artwork were easy to trade and conceal, and their attractiveness as tax-avoiding investments or versatile means of payment raised the stakes in illicit activities and in confiscations. <br><br> Anti-Semitic policies led to the dispossession of Jewish dealers such as Jacques Seligman, George Wildenstein, and Paul Rosenberg, while other Jewish galleries narrowly survived through an “Aryanization” process (the Louise Leiris, formerly Kahnweiler, Gallery). After Nazi confiscation of condemned modern art, accumulated in a back room of the Jeu de Paume museum (see Rose Valland, <i>Le Front de l’art</i>), a collaborationist market thrived with the sale of works that had not been appropriated or destroyed by the Germans. Established galleries continued to sell traditional works most in demand, such as those of Courbet, Degas, and Vlaminck, while more adventurous young dealers, such as Louis Carré and René Drouin, lent money to avant-garde artists and risked more controversial exhibits. A few art dealers contributed actively to the Resistance (René Gimpel, deported and died 1945; Jacques Seligman, executed 1941), while others (Galerie L’Esquisse) provided a front for Resistance activities.

On one hand, a spontaneous grassroots production emanated from community groups and simple citizens; on the other, an official production was ordered by Pétain in limited editions for the purpose of official gifts inscribed with his name. The first, an expression of the emotional response by the population to the savior figure of the marshal, generated an early profusion of portraits, often commercially distributed, as well as objects adorned with the effigy of the marshal or familiar related symbols (the oak leaves or seven stars adorning Pétain’s uniform, the <i>francisque</i>), to be presented to the marshal as an homage by professional associations or private individuals. The second reflects a concerted propaganda effort but also a concern among officials regarding the possibly detrimental effects of this unchecked and proliferating iconography on the image of the Vichy regime. The government sought early to control, through the granting of official stamps of approval, the use of all representations of Pétain’s likeness. Through the mobilization of volunteer schoolchildren, postcards of the marshal were distributed to raise money for the Secours National d’Hiver (winter relief), while post offices offered an assortment of portraits for sale. Busts and bronze medals were presented as prizes by the Commissariat général a` l’éducation et aux sports, and a bust commissioned from François Cogné was placed in city halls. Traditional folk art, through l’Imagerie du Maréchal à Limoges, contributed a widely distributed coloring book. The Paris Mint, Cristallerie Baccarat, and Porcelaines de Sèvres were enlisted to produce works inscribed with the words “<i>offert par le Maréchal</i>.” In April 1944, a new Service Artistique du Maréchal, under the direction of the ceramicist Robert Lallemant, sought to promote an “<i>art Maréchal</i>“ through exhibits and commissions from artists, a late attempt to establish an ambitious and unified policy to replace what had been a largely improvised and artistically pedestrian effort to engage art in the service of a political cause. <br><br> L.

Not used in France before the defeat of 1940, the term is inseparable from the Nazi doctrine of an “Aryan race” that had been “contaminated” by mingling with other, supposedly “inferior races,” particularly the Jews. In occupied France, Aryanization policies derived both from German ordinances and from Vichy’s racial laws. <br><br> Only days after its creation in early July 1940, the Vichy regime began barring Jews from government posts and public employment. Further measures eventually eliminated Jews from the press, radio, and cinema and severely restricted the number of Jewish doctors, lawyers, and university students. Another series of measures aimed to rid the French economy of Jewish influence, and in this narrower sense of economic “Aryanization” the term is most often used. By a German ordinance of 18 October 1940, businesses whose owners, directors, associates, or shareholders were Jews were to be sold or liquidated: Jews were forbidden from receiving the proceeds of these sales and from selling their property beforehand. Such expropriations were first, in December 1940, the task of “temporary administrators,” Frenchmen chosen and supervised by an overseeing agency connected to the Ministry of Industrial Production. They then became the main function of the Commissariat général des questions juives after its creation on 29 March 1941. By the end of the occupation, some 9,860 Jewish businesses in France had thus been sold or liquidated. The German “Rosenberg Services” stole thousands of paintings, sculptures, and pieces of furniture and china. In both the narrow and the larger sense, Aryanization was an integral part of the Nazi plan of destroying the European Jews: by striking at the economic vitality of the Jews, the Nazis made it impossible for them to survive social persecution. <br><br> J.

Initially, the association was made up mainly of his former colleagues from the Occupation years with an impressive array of former cabinet ministers, prefects, army officers, and academics, including General Maxime Weygand, honorary president of the ADMP from 1951 to 1965. Today, the ADMP groups together individuals sympathetic to a general right-wing agenda, including Jean-Marie Le Pen. Membership numbers are difficult to establish, as the organization has not allowed researchers access to its membership lists. However, current estimates are around 10,000. <br><br> The ADMP has three main aims: first of all, to overturn the treason verdict returned at Pétain’s postwar trial—between 1950 and 1981, Jacques Isorni, Pé- tain’s defense lawyer, made eight attempts to have the trial verdict reviewed; second, to see Pétain’s ashes transferred to Douaumont, near Verdun, to celebrate his reputation as a World War I hero; and third, to rehabilitate Pétain’s World War II record and the ideas behind Vichy’s National Revolution. Although the ADMP has remained on the margins of French politics, its influence has fluctuated with changes in contemporary French life. For example, it held an increased prominence during the Algerian war.

In light of Allied air superiority after the virtual disappearance of the Luftwaffe from the skies, the renowned German strategist regarded the forward deployment of artillery, machine guns, and armor as the only hope of preventing a successful landing of Allied armies in Europe. Accordingly, he organized the construction of a formidable network of coastal defenses, including gun emplacements and obstacles to landing craft, while planning to repel an amphibious invasion by hurling tank divisions of the Panzer Group West against the Allied forces on the landing beaches. The Allied invasion force succeeded in breaching the Atlantic Wall, which was only partially completed by the time of the invasion in June 1944. The failure of Rommel and his nominal superior, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, to obtain from Hitler direct authority over the armored divisions deployed in Normandy, together with the mistaken belief by the German high command (inspired by a shrewd Allied deception plan) that the main thrust of the invasion would come in the Pas de Calais to the east, prevented the effective use of their armor against the Allied landings on the Normandy beaches.

It appears only after the war in the <i>Grand Larousse </i>dictionary, underlining the ad hoc nature of its wartime use as a condemnation of the collective apathy and will to compromise of both the population and the politicians. Later usage of the term follows the evolution of the historiography of the Vichy period. <i>Attentisme </i>was legitimated by Robert Aron in the postwar decade as an honorable response to a difficult situation and reassessed by Robert O.

Lucie Samuel-Aubrac, a former Communist Youth militant, had passed the history examination to teach (<i>aggrégation</i>). In November 1940, together with Emmanuel d’Astier, Jean Cavaillès, and Georges Zérapha, in Clermont-Ferrand, she founded the Dernière Colonne, which published a tract. By July 1941, she was pregnant and living in Lyons with her husband, Raymond Samuel, an engineer for roads and bridges. They belonged to the small team that created the newspaper <i>Libération</i>, around which developed the paramilitary Resistance movement of the same name. <br><br>  By turns a recruiting agent in the Lyon region for <i>Libération </i>and editor of the newspaper, Raymond Samuel (pseudonym Aubrac) in 1943 became the head of the paramilitary organization that he had created. In this capacity he was with Jean Moulin in the 21 June 1943 Caluire meeting that resulted in Raymond’s second arrest, this time by the Gestapo. He owed his survival only to the composure of his wife, who, with <i>Libération </i>commandos, staged an operation that led to the freeing of several patriots on 21 October 1943. Until the spring of 1943 the couple had camouflaged their activities under a legal cover, but by the following fall they had to go underground. On 9 February 1944 they were evacuated to London and from there they continued to Algiers. <br><br> Named commissioner of the Republic for Marseilles (1944–1945), Raymond Aubrac, a Communist Party fellow traveler, was active in the peace movement. He established the Bureau d’études et de recherches pour l’industrie moderne (BÉRIM, the Bureau of Study and Research of Modern Industry), which he directed for two years. A technical consultant to Morocco, he later became a high official in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. Throughout their lives, Lucie and Raymond Aubrac have never ceased their activities in favor of human rights.

Despite the unifying force of the French Revolution regional differences had subsisted, encouraging a few autonomists and, later, separatists in Alsace-Lorraine, Brittany, and French Flanders, sometimes backed by clerics who opposed Third Republic secularism. In 1940 Nazi geopoliticians claimed that these provinces belonged to the Germanic or Celtic racial and cultural domain and should be incorporated into Germany or form associated states. With Brittany and Flanders, although separatism was initially encouraged, the Nazis decided formal separation from France should await final victory. While the war with Britain continued in these coastal areas, political stability under Vichy was vital. <br><br> Alsace was different. From 1870 to 1918 it had formed part of the German empire. One and a half million people spoke only German or were bilingual in French also; 200,000 were monoglot French. Thus, in 1940 Alsace and parts of Lorraine were de facto reannexed. Robert Ernst, a native-born Alsatian, returned to head the Elsa¨ssischer Hilfsdienst, as the nucleus for an Alsatian Nazi party. Other political parties, such as the Autonomische Landespartei, whose leader, Karl Roos, was executed by the French as a traitor in early 1940, now supported reintegration into Germany. All traces of French rule were removed, educational and cultural institutions were Germanized, and conscription into the Wehrmacht was introduced. Some 25,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers died on the eastern front. [Editor’s note: estimates of the numbers of Alsatians and Lorrainers killed vary because of the difficult immediate postwar conditions in France and the reluctance of the Soviet Union to supply information after 1945; see “Alsace- Lorraine.”] <br><br> In Brittany 1 million people spoke Breton, but most spoke French as well. Greater regional powers were desired, but few wanted independence. The Parti Autonomiste Breton first sought federalism but then turned toward separatism. In 1939 its leaders, Olier Mordrel and Francis Debauvais, fled to Germany but, returning with the occupation army, installed a Breton National Council at Pontivy. This collapsed when church leaders threatened excommunication, so the Germans withdrew their support. Another party fared better: the Parti National Breton, under Raymond Delaporte, started a regional newspaper, <i>La Bretagne</i>, with Yann Fouéré as editor; was tolerated by the Germans; and was viewed benevolently by Vichy, which approved of regionalism. The teaching of Breton in schools, a prime aim, was introduced. Moves to independence were successfully neutralized. <br><br> In Flanders a handful of separatists dreamed of a low German (<i>dietsch </i>or <i>thiois</i>) state embracing the Netherlands and Belgian and French Flanders. As they put it, “Franks, Flemings, and Frisians are first names, German is the family name.” In 1940 the <i>Abbé </i>Jean-Marie Gantois, who had set up in 1926 a Flemish League of France with initially linguistic and cultural aims, appealed to Hitler: “We are Low Germans and we wish to return to the <i>Reich</i>.” The cry fell on deaf ears, but the movement continued cultural activities until 1943. <br><br> *E.

After considering engineering as a career, he was led, following an illness, to take up writing. The success of his novel <i>La Jumente verte </i>in 1933 enabled him to devote full time to writing, and he moved to Paris. Aymé continued to publish during the Occupation. His writings, which included the novels <i>Travelingue </i>(1941), satirizing the Third Republic and the Popular Front, and <i>La Vouivre </i>(1943), were published in collaborationist periodicals such as Robert Brasillach’s <i>Je suis partout </i>and Alphonse de Châ- teaubriant’s <i>La Gerbe</i>, but Aymé also openly and at personal risk opposed anti-Semitism. Although denounced in newspapers, he was not arrested at the time of the liberation. <br><br> Aymé, however, was troubled by what he saw as the breakdown of morality during the Occupation and the severity and hypocrisy of the purges that followed. <i>Le Chemin des écoliers </i>(1946) focused on the morally corrosive effects of the black market, even on resisters who were obliged to make use of it to survive. <i>Uranus </i>(1948) is the story of a town that had descended into fear, profiteering, denunciation, and reprisal, brought on first by the Occupation, then the excesses of the purges. Aymé was one of the leaders in the unsuccessful effort to spare the life of Brasillach, executed in 1945. Seven years later he defended Brasillach’s brother, Maurice Bardèche, who incurred legal problems for his claims that the Allies, not only the Axis, had committed war crimes.

case 142: $("div#commentary").html('<b>BATTLE OF FRANCE</b> was the final phase of the German military offensive of May–June 1940 that resulted in the German defeat and occupation of France. Beginning 10 May 1940, the German offensive immediately put French troops on the defensive, starting with the seizure the next day of the Eben-Emael fortress by parachute and glider troops which enabled the German forces to circle the Belgian defenders along the Albert canal and penetrate deeply into Belgium. This disrupted French plans to defeat the Germans in Belgium. Next, skirting the Maginot Line, German troops broke through at the Meuse River by 13 May, advancing through the Ardennes forest toward the World War I Verdun and Marne battlefields. On 17 May, in a deteriorating military position, General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin, in charge of the French forces, issued an appeal to his troops and the French population to “Conquer or Die!” The following day, World War I hero Marshal Philippe Pétain was named vice-premier. On 19 May, after a week of heavy air bombardment, General Robert-Auguste Touchon of the Sixth Army began ordering civilian evacuations of the areas surrounding Reims in the Marne. Although thousands of civilians and officials had already departed, French newspapers reported victory and resolve and encouraged civilians to maintain faith in their fighting forces. <br><br>French morale suffered another blow upon reception of the news on 27 May that Belgian king Léopold III had ordered his troops to capitulate. From 28 May through 4 June, the Germans encircled French and British troops, forcing an evacuation at Dunkirk. Although the path now lay open for the final blow, the Battle of France, which was launched on 5 June, the German move west, rather than south toward Spain and Gibraltar, may have cost them a unique opportunity to close the Mediterranean to the British, thereby gravely impeding, if not destroying, the British war effort. <br><br>The actual Battle of France was a disorganized retreat by French troops led by a feeble high command. By 9 June, German troops camped 25 miles north of Paris. In a desperate effort to save the situation, Premier Paul Reynaud petitioned Winston Churchill to send British fighter planes. Unwilling to sacrifice his aircraft to what appeared a lost battle, Churchill refused the French request. At the American Embassy, Ambassador William Bullitt fruitlessly wired French demands for American aid to President Roosevelt. <br><br>On the evening of 9 June, the French cabinet discussed the evacuation of Paris and planned its retreat to Tours in the Loire Valley. Reynaud urged General Maxime Weygand, who had replaced Gamelin, to create a second line of defense in Brittany to protect France’s connection with Britain. Weygand, however, lacked sufficient troops to secure a 125-mile line of defense. On 10 June, Italy entered the war. Within days Italian fighter pilots began their assault on the fleeing troops and civilians. French military headquarters relocated to Briare along the Loire River. On 12 June, to avoid the destruction of Paris, Weygand declared it an “open city,” meaning that it would not be defended. Of Paris’ 2,829,746 population, only some 983,000 remained to greet the uncontested arrival of the German forces on 14 June. Only two civilian officials, Seine prefect Achille Villey and the police prefect, Roger Langeron, remained to receive German general Bogislav von Studnitz at the Hôtel de Ville, the city hall. <br><br>Continuing their advance, German forces, using portable pontoon bridges to cross the Loire, pursued and often overtook retreating French troops. Rather than continue to fight in Brittany, the Massif Central, or the Jura mountains, as seems to have been suggested by some, Weygand argued for a cease-fire despite the stiff resistance offered to the invaders by French forces in Tours and the Rhône valley and the continued holding out by the Maginot Line. Having relocated in Bordeaux, the Reynaud cabinet resigned on 16 June in opposition to the forces advocating capitulation led by Pétain, who headed the new government. On 17 June, in a radio broadcast speech, Pétain urged the French to “end the fight.” Although no official armistice was yet in force on the eighteenth, cities of over 20,000 population were declared “open” to avoid destruction, and many French soldiers laid down their weapons, often disbanding so as to avoid capture by German troops. On 21 June, General Charles-Léon Huntziger received orders to sign the armistice agreement at a ceremony staged by the Germans at the Rethondes site, near Compiègne, of the 1918 armistice.

She described the “Phoney War” in recently rediscovered and published war diaries and letters to Sartre.

In October 1940, all French teachers were required to sign an oath that they were neither Jews nor Freemasons as a condition of continued employment; Beauvoir signed the declaration, believing that to refuse would not have had any effect. In 1943, however, she was relieved of her teaching duties after the mother of one of her pupils lodged a complaint that Beauvoir was implicated in the corruption of a minor.

The German occupiers were aided by the Flemish National Party (VNV) and the Rexists, a small fascist party created by Léon Degrelle in French-speaking Belgium. The Germans tried to divide Flemish Belgians from the Walloons by exalting Flemish culture and emphasizing its connection to German intellectual life. By late 1940 the Germans began to systematically loot Belgian raw materials and industrial products. The Germans realigned Belgium’s financial, industrial, and agricultural systems in order to coordinate them with the German war economy. Over 500,000 Belgian workers were deported to Germany to work in war production. <br><br>After an initial period of resignation, Belgian resistance to the occupation began to surface. Farmers found ways to hide requisitioned foodstuffs, and local priests refused to say mass at the funerals of collaborators. Teachers of English used the banned speeches of Churchill and Roosevelt as class material. The Université Libre de Bruxelles closed, rather than accept a German director. Belgian refugee politicians organized a government in exile in London.

The Rhineland crisis and ratification of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936, <i>Anschluss </i>and the Munich crisis in 1938, and abortive Anglo–Franco–Soviet negotiations in 1939 all marked stages in the violent debate between appeasers and <i>bellicistes</i>. “War party,” accused the right-wing press, “Franco-Russians, sold out to the Soviets,” who will lead us to war, ruin, and Bolshevism in Europe.

The Capuchin friary became the nerve center of a vast rescue network that worked closely with local Jewish organizations.

A celebrated medievalist and historian of comparative European civilizations and professor at the University of Strasbourg and the Sorbonne, Marc Bloch was cofounder of the influential journal the <i>Annales d’histoire économique et sociale </i>(1929). From his earliest youth, Bloch was a patriot who viewed the outcome of the Dreyfus affair and the achievements of the French <i>poilu </i>(soldier) in World War I as shining emblems of the liberal Third Republic. In 1939, Bloch, the oldest reserve captain in the French army and father of six children, returned to service. He witnessed the debacle of 1940 and recorded it in the searing, posthumously published analysis <i>L’étrange défaite </i>(Strange Defeat). Foreseeing the danger to his family, Bloch tried and failed to take them to the United States. The Vichy regime, recognizing his contributions, exempted Bloch from its racial laws, allowing him to teach for two years in the unoccupied zone. But when the Germans crossed the Demarcation Line in late 1942, Bloch decided to take action. Despite his advanced age, he rose rapidly to a leadership post in Lyons in the group Franc-Tireur, took part in the Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, contributed to the underground press, and became a member of the Comité Général des Études in Paris.

The choice of Bonnet as foreign minister in 1938 signaled the government’s intention to seek an understanding with Nazi Germany. Bonnet immediately pressured the Czech government to make concessions on the Sudeten question, and when the Munich crisis reached its height in September, he worked surreptitiously to undermine efforts by Georges Mandel and Paul Reynaud to take an unyielding stand against Nazi aggression. In December 1938 Bonnet signed with Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi foreign minister, a declaration of friendship agreeing to consultation in the event of international difficulties and recognizing the Franco–German frontier. Bonnet allegedly also agreed to a German free hand in the east, which he denied, though he did raise the idea of abrogating French treaty obligations with Poland and the USSR.<br><br>In 1939 Bonnet continued to pursue a policy of appeasement even as the French government appeared to strengthen its resolve to oppose further Nazi advances. He gave the impression of wanting a tripartite alliance with the USSR, the only important counterweight to Germany in Eastern Europe, while still yielding to British policy, which wanted it less. In August 1939, as war loomed, Bonnet flirted with Fascist Italy in hopes of convening a conference along Munich lines. Last-minute foot-dragging over an ultimatum to Berlin after the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September lent little honor to France. “The man of peace at any price,” as J.-B.

Because Renault had responded efficiently to the demands of war production after September 1939, manufacturing tanks, trucks, and aircraft parts, it was inevitable that its factories would become enmeshed in collaboration.

He personally directed French police in the <i>Vélodrome d’hiver </i>roundup of Parisian Jews (July) and in the unoccupied zone (August).

The relationship, however, weakened badly after 1919, even though the French considered Britain their most important ally. France was “a bad show” to most British Tories during the 1930s, though French politicians returned the compliment. To the British, the French were insensitive and belligerent; to the French, the British casually stood off behind the English Channel, clinging to the hollow comfort of the balance of power in Europe. <br><br>As the 1930s progressed, Anglo–French relations worsened. In 1936 Nazi Germany sent troops into the demilitarized Rhineland; France wanted British support to push them out. The British shrugged off the crisis, while French diplomats cried betrayal. Many British Tories thought Hitler was not so bad. The Popular Front electoral victory disquieted the British government, which thought France was going red. The Spanish civil war seemed to offer the specter of what could happen in France. Franco–Soviet relations also made the British uneasy, and they applied heavy pressure to block Franco–Soviet staff talks in 1937. The British treated the French as though they were contemptible and weak and expected them to follow British policy. The French, who lost their nerve after 1934, felt they had little choice. <br><br>In the late 1930s the French wanted a British commitment of important ground forces, but the British could send only two divisions at war’s outset. The British wanted the French army to do the main fighting, while the British contributed air and naval forces. The French High Command objected that France could not fight alone. Some British officials understood and warned that Britain could find itself isolated if Anglo–French relations grew cold. In 1938 the French followed the British line on Anschluss and the Munich crisis. In September 1939 British officials became angry because of French delay over a declaration of war. It was an ironic twist that when the British finally resolved to fight, the French were slow to follow. <br><br>During the Phoney War, relations improved, even if there were disagreements over strategy. When the German army broke through the Ardennes, the new British prime minister, Winston Churchill, offered an Anglo–French union. The French, however, blamed the British for not committing the full power of their air force to battle and for pulling their small army back toward the French coast. Calculating that France had lost the battle, the British decided that they had to preserve their strength for their own defense. The British encouraged the French government to stay in the fight and offered radio time in London to Charles de Gaulle, though few heard him. Relations reached their nadir when the British navy attacked the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir to deny it to the enemy. <br><br>The British government lent support to the Free French and to de Gaulle, but relations were strained between de Gaulle and Churchill, two difficult men who got along with difficulty. Churchill barely forbore, thinking de Gaulle susceptible and aggressive for one possessed of so little military force. De Gaulle was wary of British domination and determined to reclaim France’s position as an equal partner in the war. In 1944 before the Normandy invasion, de Gaulle and Churchill were barely on speaking terms, but after the liberation of Paris, the two leaders walked down the Champs Élysées together to the acclaim of Parisians. Victory made relations better, as did the need to face the overpowering United States after the war. <br><br>*†M. J.

Symbols of resistance, such as Joan of Arc, Bastille Day, Danton, Napoleon at Jena, the 1914 Marne miracle, the 1918 armistice, and Bir Hakeim, rekindled hope in occupied France. “Black,” “unofficial” radio stations (“Radio Gaulle,” “Radio Patrie,” and “Radio Catholique”) worked to rally Pétainists to Resistance.

Under the command of Viscount, General John Standish Gort, the first divisions of the BEF took up defensive positions along the Franco– Belgian frontier in October 1939. With the French Seventh Army on its left flank and the French First Army on its right, the BEF held the sector immediately to the north of Lille. Reinforced throughout the winter, the BEF had 394,165 men in France, with 237,319 assigned to front-line service by 10 May 1940. Essential equipment was, however, in short supply, and there were few tanks. <br><br>In November 1939, the Allied commanders developed “Plan D” to defend Belgium and France from invasion. Nine divisions of the BEF and 30 divisions of the French First Army would move north as far as the Dyle River and join forces there with the Belgian army. Executed on 11 May 1940, Plan D exposed the BEF to attack from General Fedor von Bock’s Army Group B on 14 May 1940. As Bock’s troops pushed the Allied forces back toward the French frontier, General Gerd von Rundstedt’s Army Group A invaded France through the Ardennes. Bisecting the French line and pushing toward the channel, Rundstedt’s offensive cut communications between French and British commands and left the BEF surrounded on three sides. The British authorized Operation Dynamo, the retreat from Dunkirk, on 26 May 1940. By 4 June 1940, 224,320 British troops had been evacuated from Dunkirk. Evacuations from other sites along the channel, Atlantic, and Mediterranean continued through August 1940.

In 1941, the Deuxième Bureau became the Service des Renseignements (Intelligence Service), then reorganized and renamed the Bureau Central des Renseignements et d’Action militaire (BCRAM).

Between July and September 1942, BCRAM was reorganized and became the BCRA. <br><br>This intelligence organization contacted domestic Resistance movements and provided them with arms and officers, but the local movements ultimately regarded BCRA actions as outside interference by the London Free French. Despite the disagreement between Jean Moulin, on one side, and Brossolette and Passy, on the other, who resisted fusion between the movements and the political parties, even Moulin insisted that the movements turn over their information to the BCRA instead of handing it directly to the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) or the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). Criticized in London and Washington and accused of torture, the BCRA was hampered by disagreements with the OSS and SOE.

In view of holding the perpetrators accountable, it began establishing, as completely and authoritatively as possible, a record of crimes committed against the Jews. Forced to go underground in September 1943, when the Germans swept into the zone of southern France formerly occupied by the Italians, the CDJC paid a heavy tribute, eventually losing five of its founding members (René Hirschler, Raymond-Raoul Lambert, Léonce Bernheim, Léo Glaeser, and Nahum Herman) to Nazi repression. <br><br>Transferred to Paris after the liberation, the center set about the task of bringing a unified, systematic classification to the archives with which it was entrusted: these included the files of the Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives, the <i>Institut d’Études Juives</i>, the German Embassy, German Military Administration in France, and the anti-Jewish Gestapo. To these were later added the archives of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, the original lists of deportees on the trains from France, and the court records of war crimes trials having taken place in France and Germany.

Some members of the CII, such as Jules Verger, were convinced Vichy supporters, but another member de Tavernost was to become an active opponent of Vichy. Conflict between the CII and the Vichy government eventually led to the dissolution of the CII’s consultative committee. A new body, the Conseil Supérieur de l’Économie Industrielle et Commerciale (CSEIC), replaced the consultative committee and inherited most of its personnel.

The CDLL was the most right-wing movement represented in the CNR. Its founders were close to interwar Parti Social Franc ¸ais (PSF) circles. Although in October 1940 its first manifesto called for a struggle for liberation, it also intended to suppress representative democracy in a future France and to “get rid . . . of the stateless Jews and the pitiless international financiers and gangsters.” This stance was in obvious contradiction to a fight against a racist dictatorship; it hence became unsustainable and rapidly disappeared. <br><br>Early on, the movement recruited its members among reserve officers. It gathered military intelligence, helped allied aviators and resisters escape through Spain and Switzerland, and aided Service du Travail Obligatoire evaders. The Vengeance membership brought to the CDLL expertise in wiretapping into the German communications network. The efficiency of the movement resulted from the competence of its members and its links with the Air Force Intelligence Service in Vichy, which was in touch with the British Intelligence Service. After the invasion of the southern zone, the CDLL joined Fighting France. By the end of the war, the movement published an underground paper, <i>Ceux de la Libération</i>, which has been called <i>La France libre </i>since May 1944. The CDLL had seven successive leaders.

The single enemy, whether Jew, Englishman, Freemason, or communist, is missing from the scenarios. Anti-Semitic, Anglophobic, anti-Masonic, and anti-communist discourse, however, was present in interwar cinema. These unifying themes were to disappear from the screen as soon as they became the components of the political doctrine of Vichy and of antinationalist (collaborationist) groups. The tone of the Occupation-era film production made little reference to extremist ideology. <br><br>Films avoided the reality of the era because the public wanted to escape it. Directors turned out comedies and period films with lavish costumes and reproduced the American styles popular during the interwar years (musical comedies and grade B police thrillers). In all, only 10 films made explicit reference to the war and Occupation. Does this mean that the productions ignored reality? <br><br>Hardly—behind the laughter and the escapism the reality of contemporary life is evident. Despite the many filmmakers (some 50 producers and 65 directors), the films are homogeneous in form and content, evoking a solidly conservative France. The atmosphere of Vichy shows through, but the world represented under Vichy was present already in films before 1940. Even if some of the values of Vichy were present in interwar films, however, the advent of the regime brought a wave of some 1,300 new films. Beginning in June 1940, Vichy values were the only ones shown. However, choices were made, and the most odious of them—anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic, for example—disappeared. Analyses of film narratives reveal recurring itineraries or paths. The search by the protagonist (a couple, group, or family) expresses a certain logic, emphasizing the dominant values without which the established order cannot be perpetuated: community, struggle, and success. From these values emerges a message that nothing is won in advance and that one must earn one’s good fortune. Yet within what kind of society? A society in which the bourgeoisie is ubiquitous—in the countryside as in Paris. The film narratives feature a social critique when they represent the Third Republic’s ruling elite, symbolized in the defense of Maître Loursat (Raimu) in Henri Decoin’s <i>Les Inconnus dans la maison</i>. It is a social critique that protects the existing order and institutions when the situation calls for creating a new world. This perspective reflects the aspirations of a France that sees its future in the continuity of economic and political power after having purged itself of certain pre-1940 moral values. Essentially, the couple, generally between ages 20 and 30, and the bourgeois family are the foundations of this society in formation, where big business is seldom shown, replaced instead by technocrats and the liberal professions as town notables. This cinematic narrative form also features a Catholic bourgeoisie, subject to authority personified by the father or the leader (<i>chef</i>), who thinks for the others and who upholds a sense of tradition. When this authority figure speaks, he exalts union in Jacques Daniel-Norman’s <i>La Loi du printemps</i>, the redemptive earth in Émile Couzinet’s <i>Andorra</i>, victory over oneself in Louis Daquin’s <i>Premier de cordée</i>, the leader in Léo Joannon’s <i>Carrefour des enfants perdus</i>, family honor in Jean Dréville’s <i>Les Roquillard</i>, love for others in André Hugon’s <i>Le Chant de l’exilé</i>, nationalism in the Christian-Jaque film <i>La Symphonie fantastique</i>, and solidarity in Louis Daquin’s <i>Nous les gosses</i>. The evolution of this society is through the child, who is the bearer of the future, even if, at given moments, as depicted in certain narratives, he is also the source of frustrating problems, as in <i>Monsieur des Lourdines </i>by Pierre de Hérain, or if he defies his parents, as in <i>Mariage de chiffon </i>by Claude Autant- Lara. <br><br>The woman is confined within a well-defined role. As ever, there is a vamp; three heroines play the roles of beauties, Ginette Leclerc in Henri-Georges Clouzot’s <i>Le Corbeau </i>and Jacques Houssin’s <i>Le Mistral</i>; Mireille Balin in Jacques Becker’s <i>Dernier Atout</i>; and Viviane Romance in Abel Gance’s <i>La Vénus aveugle</i>. Women of the demimonde in fashionable society are themes in Jacques de Baroncelli’s <i>La Duchesse de Langeais </i>and Maurice Tourneur’s <i>Mam’zelle Bonaparte</i>. However, the woman is more generally synonymous with duty and sacrifice, as in Jean Stelli’s <i>Le Voile bleu</i>. Above all, she represents mother. Nevertheless, beginning in 1941, a new image of the family began to crystallize, in which sincere and fecund love dominate, and so much the worse if it resulted in a deviation from habitual norms. Films portray the recognition of the “illegitimate child” and the rehabilitation of the unmarried mother. The latter, temporarily marginalized by society, ends up by reintegrating into society and marrying, as in Marcel Pagnol’s <i>La Fille du puisatier </i>and Émile Couzinet’s <i>Andorra</i>. The family is an indispensable unit, without which the child cannot receive a complete education. The films, however, never preach in favor of large families. If, in a given narrative, the father or mother is left alone with the children, as in <i>Les Ailes Blanches </i>by Robert Péguy, the situation turns out to be temporary. <br><br>This society is not disturbed by class struggle. Before 1940, the worker was portrayed as practically mute, solitary, and certainly not a union member. Beginning in 1941, he might protest strongly against his working conditions, as in André Cayatte’s <i>Au Bonheur des dames</i>, but after a period of agitation, everything returns to order and perfect harmony based on the Labor Charter. If the boss behaves in a despotic manner with respect to his workers—showing the working world is, however, the exception; worker–boss relations are replaced by those of servant–master—the boss’ attitude is generally criticized by the internal logic of the film. Mean-spirited employers will have no place in the new society depicted at the end of the story, as in Jacques Becker’s <i>Goupi Mains Rouges</i>.<br><br>The homogeneity of the Occupation cinema can be fully explained neither by state censorship directives nor by self-censure on the part of the filmmakers. It was produced, instead, by consensus. With the liberation, directors agreed unanimously that the Occupation years had been a golden age for French cinema. They cited the benefits of legislation that did away with the anarchy of the 1930s in the profession and that, by banning Anglo-American films, suppressed competition. At the same time, they were not responsible for the persecutions and purges of 1940, due essentially to external forces. Doesn’t this view recognize, however, that the film world accommodated itself quite well to the political circumstances of the Occupation? <br><br>*†J.-P.

In studying these films, vectors of memory, the historian can create a map of representations and reconstruct the memory of one of the cruelest of the contemporary Franco- French wars. Five distinct periods emerge. <br><br>From 1944 through 1946, a myth was formed. All the films, whether made by the Service Cinématographique aux Armées (SCA) (Army Film Service) or by the Comité de Libération du Cinéma Français (CLCF) (liberation Committee for French Film) and its production cooperative or whether or not made commercially, offer the same image: a France that is entirely resistant. <i>La Bataille du rail </i>by René Clément in 1945 is symbolic of this heroic behavior. In this imagery, popular desire and the will of the political authorities seem to converge; the specificity of Vichy is not addressed, thereby combining the two Gaullist concepts of “Republican continuity” and “the Thirty Years’ War,” seeing World War II as an extension of the 1914 conflict. The focus on the <i>soldats de l’ombre </i>(soldiers of the shadows; sometimes called soldiers of the night), the Resistance fighters, shows a movement linked to London but willfully ignores the internecine struggles of Gaullists and communists. The entire country is seen at war, mobilized against the German, the hereditary enemy, except for a few collaborating traitors—and the genocide is hidden. If offers an essentially patriotic view, taking up the challenge of reconstruction and allowing an avoidance of questions of national identity. <br><br>From 1947 through 1957, the facade of myth cracks. Through their fictional portrayals, Sacha Guitry, Claude Autant-Lara, and Henri-Georges Clouzot, themselves victims of the postwar purges, express their bitterness regarding the excesses of the purges or legitimate the attitude of those who, unreflectingly, had figured out how to profit from the Occupation. This cinema shows a wait68 and-see France anxious about daily life and skeptical, as in <i>Nous sommes tous les assassins </i>by André Cayatte, 1951, and, as in Autant-Lara’s <i>La Traversée de Paris</i>, 1956, recalling the less glorious aspects of the Occupation, such as the black market. Black legend comes to replace heroic legend. The specificity of racial deportation is still obscured. The films do not establish any distinction between a concentration camp and an extermination camp. <i>Nuit et Brouillard </i>(Night and Fog) by Alain Resnais in 1956 shares the characteristics of this period. <br><br>From 1958 through 1969, a Gaullist myth grew. While a minority antiheroic cinema continued to explore the dark regions of the past to illuminate the new confrontations of the Algerian war, as in Jean Dewever’s <i>Les Honneurs de la guerre</i>, 1961, the dominant cinema projected an “ecumenical Gaullism,” evoking the new politics of memory that the general embodied after his return to power in 1958. This perspective glorified the “<i>armée de l’ombre</i>,” extolled in André Malraux’s speech on the occasion of the transfer of Jean Moulin’s ashes to the Panthéon in 1964. The cinema of these years—for example, <i>Babette s’en va-t-en guerre </i>by Christian-Jaque in 1959 and <i>Paris brûle-t-il? </i>by René Clément in 1967, focusing on the Resistance hero and on the general—deals more with celebrations than with analyses. <i>L’Armée des Ombres</i>, by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1969, concludes this period and marks a turning point. Admittedly, the author pays personal homage to several historical figures, but the film places more emphasis on the internal contradictions of the characters, Philippe Gerbier, Mathilde, and Luc Jardie, who in the end are victims of their primordial and sentimental drives. As to the evocation of the genocide, it appears together with the increasingly awakening Jewish memory that occurs throughout the 1960s. <i>L’Enclos</i>, by Armand Gatti (1961), is the first French work of fiction to address the topic. <br><br>From 1969 through 1974 the myth takes a beating. The arrival of a new political class, less closely linked to the Resistance, the film <i>Le Chagrin et la Pitié </i>(The Sorrow and the Pity) by Marcel Ophuls (1969), and Anglophone historical research that proposes a new reading of Vichy and the Occupation with <i>Vichy France </i>by Robert O. Paxton in 1973 provoke a true revolution, rejecting the then-current conformism in historical perspective and removing the taboos that had sustained the mythology of Gaullism. Ophuls’ film expresses a real reversal of perspective. He depicts a Vichy resulting from the defeat and the Occupation and equally from the political and ideological history of France. He brings to light a specifically French anti-Semitism and raises questions relating to choice and engagement, a problem central to the 1974 film of Louis Malle, <i>Lacombe Lucien</i>. The way is open for a cinema that contradicts accepted ideas. <i>Souvenirs d’en France </i>by André Téchiné in 1975 denounces a Gaullism that had permitted the artificial maintenance of a form of capitalism, entirely illusory and ill adapted to international competition. <i>L’affiche rouge </i>by Franck Cassenti in 1976 retraces the history of the Manouchian group, composed, in large part, of immigrant Resistance members. Through their story, the film poses the fundamental question of representation in history. <i>Les Guichets du Louvre </i>by Michel Mitrani in 1974 and <i>Un sac de billes </i>by Jacques Doillon in 1975 evoke the persecution of the Jews. <br><br>Since the 1980s, despite the emotion aroused by the Klaus Barbie, René Bousquet, and Paul Touvier affairs, one sees a trivialization in the evocation of history, a virtual absence of analysis—with the exception of Jean Chérasse’s <i>La Prise du pouvoir de Philippe Pétain </i>of 1979—along with humanistic personal memoirs and expiatory images of the national bad conscience, as in <i>Shoa </i>by Claude Lanzmann in 1985 and <i>Au revoir les enfants </i>by Malle in 1987; iconoclastic parody or anarchist pamphleteering that delegitimates all the actors in the conflict, as in <i>Papy fait la résistance </i>by Jean-Marie Poiré in 1982 and <i>Uranus </i>by Claude Berri in 1991; a more consensual viewpoint in <i>Le Dernier Métro </i>by François Truffaut in 1980; and, finally, a return to conformity in the evocation of the Resistance in <i>Boulevard des Hirondelles </i>by Josée Yanne in 1992. <br><br>The cinematic representations of the dark years of the Occupation have carefully avoided tackling the question of Vichy ideology and of the role of Marshal Pétain. Two films in close succession, however, defied the stereotype: <i>L’OEil de Vichy </i>by Claude Chabrol and <i>Pétain </i>by Jean Marbeuf. With <i>LOEil de Vichy</i>, Chabrol wanted to unmask the lies told by the daily newspapers of a regime that extolled the unity of all the French around the marshal and the National Revolution. <i>Pétain</i>, a piece of fiction adapted from Marc Ferro’s book, intertwines a history seen from on high, from the experience of statesmen, with another history, this one seen from below, which shows the anonymous French. Independently of the genres, of the positions taken, of the successes or failures, for the first time, with these films, cinema came to address the role of Vichy based on historical analysis rather than political pamphlet. <br><br>J.-P.

Considered the major Catholic dramatist of his time, Claudel developed a poetic, deeply spiritual theater that focuses on the struggle between God and humanity. Born in Villeneuve-sur-Fèure, he attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. Profoundly influenced by the symbolist poets, he studied for the diplomatic service while torn by spiritual conflict. A mystical experience at Notre Dame in 1886 precipitated his conversion to Catholicism in 1890, which influenced his career as diplomat (1893–1935) and writer. After considering monastic life, Claudel directed his energies into playwriting. His plays, complex and long, often panoramic in scope, were produced only many years after publication. During the Occupation, Jean-Louis Barrault approached Claudel for permission to perform <i>Le Soulier de Satin </i>(written 1929). Claudel reluctantly agreed to work with Barrault on cutting the mammoth script. Its premiere at the <i>Come ´die Française </i>in 1943 became the period’s major theatrical event. In spite of shortages of electricity and material for props, the innovative production proved extremely popular. German authorities, who had combed the script but found nothing objectionable, were suspicious of the enthusiasm that the production generated and eventually closed it. The Occupation saw revivals of Claudel’s <i>L’Annonce Fait à Marie </i>in Paris (1941–1942) and, thanks to Louis Jouvet’s touring company, throughout Latin America (1941–1945) and also of the opera <i>Jeanne au bûcher</i>, for which Claudel wrote the libretto for Arthur Honegger’s music. <br><br>Although Claudel’s conservative sympathies prompted him to write “Ode au Maréchal,” celebrating Philippe Pétain, his work, especially as staged by Barrault, inspired admiration across the political spectrum.

Despite his notoriety as both a homosexual and drug user, which set French fascists against him, Cocteau survived the Occupation thanks to his many connections. Born in Maisons-Lafitte, Cocteau moved with his family to Paris in 1899, where he attended the Lycée Condorcet. He volunteered as an ambulance driver during the First World War and fraternized in Montparnasse with painters, composers, and poets, including Guillaume Apollinaire, whose passion for surrealism he shared. After the war, Cocteau wrote the themes for two innovative ballets. His affair with novelist Raymond Radiguet and Radiguet’s early death in 1923 led him back to opium, to which he had previously been addicted. Along with writing poetry, the memoir <i>Opium </i>(1929), and fiction, notably <i>Thomas l’imposteur </i>(1922) and <i>Les enfants terribles </i>(1929), Cocteau worked prolifically as a playwright, completing <i>Orphée </i>(1926), <i>La Machine Infernale </i>(1934), and <i>Les Parents Terribles </i>(1938), and directed the film <i>Le Sang d’un Poète </i>(1931). His relationship with actor Jean Marais, which lasted until Cocteau’s death, began in 1937. <br><br>As France neared defeat in 1940, Cocteau fled to Perpignan, returning with a new script, <i>La Machine à écrire</i>. Its debut (1941) caused a riot, due more to Cocteau’s reputation than the play, and it and <i>Les Parents Terribles </i>were banned. His <i>Renaud et Armide </i>(1943), written for the <i>Comédie Française</i>, was safer and thus praised, as was his screenplay for the film <i>L’Éternel Retour </i>(1943), which starred Marais. Cocteau walked a precarious tightrope, maintaining relations with the occupiers as well as with his avant-garde friends. He was photographed attending Arno Breker’s opening at l’Orangerie but petitioned Otto Abetz to save Jewish poet Max Jacob from Drancy. One of Cocteau’s major discoveries during the Occupation was the writer Jean Genet. After the liberation, Cocteau was attacked in print but cleared of collaboration.

case 221: $("div#commentary").html('<b>COLLABORATION</b> and, by extension, its explicitly articulated ideology— collaborationism—in virtually all Western languages are terms with both positive connotations of cooperation and negative ones of treason, the latter from World War II usage, especially in France. Evaluations of collaboration can change over time. In France, for example, the writer Paul Morand, an ambassador under Vichy, was silenced after 1945, yet his work regained popularity several years later. Discussions of collaboration often focus on the more public cases: writers such as Robert Brasillach, shot in 1945, or the women “horizontal collaborators,” who had sexual relations with German soldiers and at the liberation were paraded with their heads shorn and otherwise humiliated. High-level administrators, such as those involved in the surrender to the Germans of the French-owned Bor copper mines in Yugoslavia, often went unpunished. <br><br>The positions taken by collaborators after the 1940 defeat had historic roots in France. In September 1936, Roger Martin du Gard wrote that he preferred even fascism in France and Hitler to a war that might mean the triumph of communism, words nearly reechoed by Pierre Laval in 1943, when he publicly supported a German victory. The German victory of 1940, which appeared definitive to so many, drew collaborators from throughout the French political spectrum, including ex-socialist Marcel Déat, ex-syndicalists Hubert Lagardelleand René Belin, libertarian, literary, nonconformist author Louis-Ferdinand Céline, and witty gastronomes Robert Courtine and Pierre Andrieu. Even the communists thought they could work with the Germans. Some outside the pre- 1940 French power structure now had an opportunity to settle private scores. The June 1941 attack on the Soviet Union brought fervent anticommunists, many of whom were in ex-communist Jacques Doriot’s Parti Populaire Franc ¸ais (PPF), into collaboration or intensified their dispositions toward it. Philippe Henriot, who became a powerful voice on Vichy radio in 1944, was strongly anticommunist. A turning point was the Allied landing in North Africa in November 1942, which signaled to many that the war was lost for the Germans, but collaboration extended through the end of the Occupation and beyond in the phantom Sigmaringen government and in apologetic postwar positions. There are, broadly, six ways the collaboration has been seen, involving not always parallel arguments about consequences and intentions. The worst-case scenarios hold that France had many collaborators with base motives taking advantage of the situation as in <i>Chantons sous l’occupation </i>(Singing under the Occupation), as the title of Alphonse Halimi’s 1976 film satirically put it. Collaboration’s consequences neither saved the Jews nor helped France; they aided Hitler. Marshal Pétain’s “sinister rendezvous” with Hitler at Montoire, in the words of historian Marc Ferro, led to the deportation of Jews—negotiated by Vichy police chief René Bousquet—the fervent wishes for German victory, and the <i>milice</i>, created in 1943 to fight against the Resistance. Collaborators could be Jews trying to save themselves. Usually advanced by historians and sometimes by the French press, though never by collaborators themselves, this is generally the argument of the Left, holding that without French collaboration, the Germans could not have done the damage that they did. <br><br>A second, middle group of arguments sees collaboration as hard to prove. Motivations were often unclear, and the consequences mixed; for example, the French could not decide how to respond to Operation Torch in North Africa, so their actions had little consequence in the unfolding of events. Most historians argue that, in the long run, collaboration mattered little: the Allies won the war, and France reemerged to create a Fourth Republic barely different from the Third. <br><br>A third range of scenarios suggests that collaboration was rare because what may have appeared as such was really resistance. Collaboration was really a disaster for Germany. Expressed in the title of a 1966 memoir, <i>Pétain contre Hitler </i>(Pétain against Hitler) by Gabriel Jeantet, a former member of Vichy’s Groupes de protection, this postwar interpretation of collaboration has been termed “Pétaino-Gaullist” by historian Fred Kupferman. In an odd way, it was Hermann Göring’s argument—that the French were deceiving the Germans at every opportunity, trying to strengthen themselves to actively reenter the war against them. Some former collaborators have suggested, in a fourth view, although without evidence, that General de Gaulle’s 1940 resistance, independent of his motivations, worked to get more out of the Germans for Pétain. <br><br>In a fifth view of collaboration, whatever its intentions, it fended off a “polonization” of France, or reduction of France to the status of Germanadministered Poland, where losses were much higher. In this view, Vichy may have inadvertently helped save its own enemies: Jews, Freemasons, and communists. That the existence of Vichy saved the French from a worse fate and halted the German advance in the west is argued by Pétainists, who claim that this was the goal of collaboration, and by historians who suggest that this was a consequence but that it had nothing to do with the intentions of the collaborators. Seen this way, this sixth view holds the very nature of Germany’s French enterprise to have been a mistake. By permitting Vichy to exist in 1940, the Germans failed to realize the potentialities of their own victory. In the euphoria of their 1940 victory, the Germans halted their advance toward Spain, Gibraltar, and North Africa when they might have disrupted the British empire. Continued French Resistance from North Africa might have forced the Germans into a more thorough and successful Mediterranean strategy. <br><br>Conversely, by failing to make peace with the French, the Germans committed themselves to a two-front war after 1941, when they desperately needed their military resources for use in Russia. A contented and neutral France, like Sweden, might have provided the Germans goods they needed and broken the French-British alliance, possibly in return for only Wallonia, a suggestion made during the Occupation by one of the collaborationists, Pierre Clémenti. Laval told the Germans that they could not win in the east without a settlement in the west. In this view, the Germans, despite their spoliation of occupied France to the extent of hundreds of millions of francs, got the worst of all combinations by neither pressing their 1940 victory nor making peace with France. <br><br>The mere existence of Vichy and the very enthusiasm of French collaboration sufficiently beguiled the Germans—perhaps against their own better judgment— into accepting a halfway solution that might well have lost them the war. In June 1940, no one in France could have imagined that the Germans would not follow up their victory with a forward southern strategy, nor could they foresee the invasion of Russia. Had there been a real collaborationist conspiracy or double game, the Germans would have learned of it. Essentially without reserves after the 1943 Battle of Kursk, the Germans had to commit large numbers of troops to the defense of France. Liberated France in 1944 had suffered fewer casualties and less destruction than any of the other major belligerents. Many collaboration apologists and subsequent historians combine the various arguments about intentions and consequences in their work, making it hard to separate them. At present, with memories still at fever pitch because of the recent trials in France and many documents still to assess in French archives, it is unclear how history will choose among the options or in what combination. <br><br>B.

It organized a general staff of the Forces Françaises d’Intérieure (FFI) and hoped that the interior Resistance would form a new army to liberate France. <br><br>COMAC’s claims led to difficulty with the exterior Resistance because the concept of a centralized military command endangered the interior Resistance and because the Bureau Central des Renseignements et d’Action (BCRA) perceived a large communist presence in the CNR and COMAC. A compromise centralized COMAC’s organization and decentralized its command. COMAC’s control over the FFI would last until the liberation began. At that point, the FFI would be under General Pierre Koenig.<br><br>When the liberation began, COMAC refused to renounce its original role as the command unit of the FFI.

Its journal was the <i>Cahiers franco-allemands</i>, whose contributors included Alphonse de Châteaubriant and Pierre Drieu la Rochelle. Among the members of its sister organization in Germany, the Deutsch- Französische Gesellschaft, were the prominent academics Achim von Arnim and Friedrich Grimm. <br><br>The Comité was envisioned during the 1930 Sohlberg youth congress, which brought together the German Francophile teacher Otto Abetz, future ambassador to occupied France, and the journalist Jean Luchaire, editor of <i>Notre Temps</i>, and resulted in the forming of the Comité d’entente de la Jeunesse pour la rapprochement allemand.

Cooperation was fostered through visits to Nazi Germany by young people, war veterans, and writers. Exploited by Ribbentrop, the Comité came to be seen in France as a fifth column.

A true State Council, the clandestine CGÉ studied questions of justice, in particular a future purge; the press, notably the future banning of the collaborationist press; and administration, with attention to the nomination of new prefects and commissioners of the Republic. The economic and constitutional future of France also came under study. The CGÉpublished a clandestine review, the <i>Cahiers politiques</i>, where a project similar to the future Fifth Republic was sketched out by Debré.

The law proposed the establishment of a committee to deal with each sector of the economy. These committees were to draw up plans for production and to coordinate measures taken by various companies. <br><br>Suggestions that the COs anticipated the more etatist and organized economy of post-1945 France—and, indeed, they survived, under a slightly different name, until 1946—place too much emphasis on the coherence and purpose of Vichy industrial organization. There was great variation in the importance of the various COs, specifically differences between those run by men with strong ideas about the ways to change their industries (as François Lehideux had about the automobile industry) and those run by men who wished to represent their industries as had the prewar employers’ syndicates. Many plans for long-term industrial change were undermined by the scarcity of raw materials, which sometimes made the Organisation Centrale de Répartition des Produits Industriels, established on 27 September 1940, more important than the COs. Finally, industrial organization at Vichy was always a chaotic matter. Roger Martin, who became an official with a CO, suggested that “individuals, employers, and the nation itself were tied up in a bitter battle for survival and the total absence of information made all preparation for the future impossible.

Established at the prodding of the occupation authorities, but with its jurisdiction extending to both the occupied and unoccupied zones, the CGQJ was first headed by Xavier Vallat, a strong anti-Semite but also an anti-German nationalist. <br><br>Under Vallat the CGQJ attempted to unify anti-Jewish policy throughout both zones and to do so energetically and efficiently. Implicit in Vallat’s approach was the hope that the Germans would gradually withdraw from this field, leaving the task to the French alone. After issuing a comprehensive anti-Jewish law on 2 June 1941 redefining the Jews, the CGQJ sponsored a flurry of decrees in one field after another, drastically limiting the number of Jews in commerce and the professions and announcing a detailed census of Jews in the unoccupied zone, a grave step that profoundly shocked Jewish opinion and that was to have fatal consequences later when Jews were rounded up and deported. Also, by a law of 22 July 1941 the CGQJ launched a vast process of “Aryanization,” the confiscation of Jewish property in the unoccupied zone. Eager to ensure that Jewish property did not find its way to the Reich, the French government designated the CGQJ as the agency taking charge of confiscating Jewish property throughout France. The goal was to liquidate or sell all Jewish holdings for the benefit of France. This vast project, which eventually involved more than 42,000 Jewish enterprises, drained the legislative and administrative energies of the CGQJ. Corruption and inefficiency followed, despite Vallat’s efforts to combat both. <br><br>Under Vallat’s successor, Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, venality became widespread. The agency spawned a parapolice organization, the Sections d’enquête et de contrôle (Investigation and Control Sections). Darquier and his lieutenants were not adverse to working with the Nazis and did so notably when roundups and deportations spread throughout France in the summer of 1942. When possible, Vichy kept the CGQJ at arm’s length, but the anti-Jewish machinery continued to function and even to accelerate the rate of persecution. <br><br>In late 1943, the Germans pressured Vichy to drop Darquier, recognizing that he was unable to bring the Vichy government fully into line with Nazi policy. His successor was Charles Mercier du Paty de Clam, an undistinguished civil servant descended from the famous officer who arrested Alfred Dreyfus in 1894. With the end in sight, du Paty de Clam left his office in May. Pierre Laval, to the end concerned to maintain control and government continuity in this sphere as in others, named Joseph Antignac, one of its top officials, to head the commissariat. Remarkably, “business as usual” remained the policy of the CGQJ even after the Allies went ashore in Normandy.

Almost immediately, the parliament banned the party press. However, on 2 September PCF deputies, with Moscow’s approval, voted war credits. In late September parliament dissolved the PCF and affiliated organizations. By 7 September Stalin had decided to term the war “imperialist.” Ordered to desert, PCF leader Maurice Thorez complied on 4 October and arrived in Moscow in November. In October, the French government suspended numerous communist municipal councils.

In May 1941 <i>Humanité </i>urged the working class to profit from the crisis to move toward an international revolutionary movement. The Nazi attack on the USSR rallied the PCF to a war now characterized as an antifascist liberation struggle. <br><br>In October 1941 the PCF Organisation Spéciale ordered sabotage and actions against German personnel. The following February, the party called for armed struggle, organizing underground partisans and franc-tireurs (FTP). Guerrilla war was not possible in most of France, and sabotage actions were conducted by small groups until mid-1943, when the first <i>maquis </i>was formed. In March 1943 de Gaulle’s envoy Jean Moulin won PCF agreement to participate in a Conseil National de la Résistance. Meanwhile, the USSR supported the new Comité Française de libération nationale (CFLN), established in Algiers under de Gaulle and, briefly, General Henri Giraud. The Soviets granted the CFLN a higher degree of recognition as a Provisional Government than did the British or the Americans, and in rallying to it and de Gaulle, the PCF gained full reintegration into the national community from which it had been excluded in 1939. <br><br>The PCF succeeded in controlling the armed forces of the Resistance, the Forces Françaises de l’Intérieur (FFI), while its own FTP kept its autonomous organization. However, immediately after the liberation of Paris, in which the communists played a major role, de Gaulle moved quickly to deprive the PCF of any autonomous military power. The general staff of the FFI was dissolved, and the organization itself amalgamated to the army of Africa and Italy. De Gaulle also dissolved the paramilitary communist <i>gardes civiques</i>. De Gaulle amnestied Thorez and permitted him to return to France in November 1944. In December, Thorez issued a call for surrender of the arms stockpiled by PCF organizations. Under instructions from the Soviets, the party had chosen peaceful means to gain power—or to await a time when Soviet power would be greater. Thorez became deputy prime minister, and in the 1945 elections the PCF became the strongest party. <br><br>*† J.-P. Azéma, A. Prost, and J. P.

It has been argued that the armistice itself was Goebbels’ idea. It was signed in the same railway car, at the Rethondes clearing near Compiègne in northern France, in which Marshal Ferdinand Foch had dictated armistice terms to German representatives in November 1918. Foch’s railway car had been moved back to Rethondes for the 1927 anniversary of the 11 November armistice. Replete with Hitler’s gloating and vengeful expressions, the story of the armistice signing and the terms dictated to the French was broken by the American correspondent William L. Shirer, who managed to listen in on the negotiations. Carefully staged by the Germans, the ceremony was later described as “Goebbels’ big show.” A monument at Rethondes to the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France in 1918 was destroyed at Hitler’s order, but he allowed a statue of Foch to remain there. The Germans let the clearing become overgrown. Following the signing of the 1940 armistice, Goebbels had the car moved to Berlin, where it was shown to German crowds for several weeks near the Brandenburg Gate. It was then garaged and in 1944 moved to Ohrdruf in Thuringia.

Although the 1940 armistice is rarely mentioned, Compiègne is a reminder of the flaws of German decision making during a brief moment of opportunity, when the Germans might have engaged Spain as an ally and moved south to Gibraltar and North Africa or, conversely, granted the French a more generous settlement that might have allowed Germany to disengage in the west and focus its resources on Central and Eastern Europe. <br><br>S.

In February 1939, the first French concentration camp was opened at Rieucros. Some 330,000 Spanish civil war refugees were temporarily detained there and at other camps in southwestern France. Following France’s declaration of war with Germany, in a second wave of detention, some 18,000 to 20,000 refugees from Germany and Austria, now viewed as “enemy nationals,” were, along with certain members of the banned Communist Party, sent to the camps in the fall of 1939. While most of these detainees were released a few weeks later, the German invasion in May 1940 provoked a third series of internments, as Premier Paul Reynaud ordered that enemy nationals once again be detained in camps. Inheriting the camps from the Third Republic, Vichy targeted Jews by authorizing departmental prefects to intern them at will. By the end of 1940, some 40,000 detainees, including 28,000 Jews, were being held in French concentration camps in the southern, unoccupied zone.<br><br>Although not intended for the purpose, the French concentration camps facilitated the Nazi Final Solution in France, since it was primarily from these camps that Jews were taken to be deported. The largest camp in the occupied zone, Drancy, served as the point of departure for the great majority of trains to Auschwitz, including the first, which left on 27 March 1942. French camps were never killing centers, but conditions varied from poor to severely harsh: some 3,000 internees died in French custody. A number of Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic relief organizations, coordinated by the umbrella group called “Le comité de Nîmes,” tried to alleviate suffering, providing supplemental food, shelter, and medical care and alerting world opinion to the problem. <br><br>A.

The Communist Party (PCF) was influential within the CGT but fell into disarray following the Nazi–Soviet pact of 23 August 1939. The PCF and CGT were further disoriented when Soviet troops crossed the Polish border on 17 September. Right-wing factions, led by René Belin, became ascendant within the CGT. When the Édouard Daladier government expelled communist deputies from parliament, the right-wing leadership of the CGT followed suit and expelled communists from its ranks in September 1939. The transformation was complete when Belin accepted the post of minister of production and labor in the Pétain government. The CGT offered to collaborate with the Vichy regime, but its concessions were not enough. On 9 November Belin signed a decree dissolving the CGT and all other unions. <br><br>In 1940 the Pétain government issued its Labor Charter (<i>Charte du travail</i>), which replaced the CGT with a system of corporatist groupings that united workers and employers in similar industries. The CGT did not disappear completely. It retained an underground presence, and its members cooperated with the Resistance. On 27 July 1944 the Provisional Government in Algeria issued a decree abolishing the <i>Charte du travail </i>and restoring the CGT and other unions to their prewar positions. Hundreds of right-wing militants who had cooperated with Belin were banned from further union activity.

Representatives of eight Resistance movements, six political parties, and two trade unions first met as the CNR in Paris on 27 May 1943 under the presidency of Jean Moulin. The CNR declared Vichy’s actions void and voted Charles de Gaulle full confidence as representative of the nation’s interests, an endorsement that considerably helped the general in his negotiations with the Allies. For his part, de Gaulle promised to restore France’s democratic rights as soon as possible. The resisters, who distrusted the politicians from the Third Republic’s parties, refused to give the CNR executive authority over their movements. But the CNR did appoint a steering committee of five, which met regularly and oversaw the work of several commissions designed to prepare for the liberation and the transfer of power, the most important of which was the Comité d’action militaire (COMAC), which coordinated the Resistance army and the maquis. Georges Bidault became president of the steering committee after the arrest of Moulin in June 1943. <br><br>At the liberation, de Gaulle refused the CNR any role in the state as the representative of the Resistance. Some of its members, however, did join his government. Although kept away from power or the appearance of it at the liberation, the CNR exercised a lasting influence through its Charter of 15 March 1944. <br><br>The CNR Charter represented the social and economic reforms that many rank-and-file resisters thought they had been fighting for, and enactment of its provisions were continually demanded by the local press and local organizations. Its great popularity influenced those who drafted the constitutions of the Fourth and Fifth Republics. The charter proclaimed that resisters would remain unified after the liberation in order to accomplish the five following goals: (1) establish the Republic under de Gaulle; (2) punish traitors and purge collaborators from the administration and professions; (3) confiscate the profits of war profiteers and black marketeers; (4) reestablish universal suffrage and civil liberties, including the absolute equality of all citizens before the law and respect for individual human rights; and (5) promote reforms to create true economic and social democracy, including nationalization of the greatest industrial and financial companies, creation of the means of worker participation in management, subordination of the economy to a plan, establishment of the right to work and to rest, guarantee of an adequate wage level, reestablishment of independent trade unions, implementation of a comprehensive social security plan, extension of political, social, and economic rights to colonial citizens, and establishment of educational equality in order to create an elite of merit rather than of birth. <br><br>The Constituent Assembly made attempts to fulfill some of these provisions in 1945–1946. They nationalized the coal fields, the gas and electric companies, the Banque de France and four other banks, the Renault factories, and the aircraft industry.

Although discussed thereafter, such a “corporation” did not really exist, and Pierre Caziot, the minister of agriculture, has been seen erroneously as its “father.” A specialist on land-related questions, Caziot was no corporatist and was barely interested in syndicalism. He intervened only from fear of being short-circuited by Marshal Pétain’s entourage and from anxiety about the ambitions of the corporatists. Obligatory membership, an immediate end to the Chambres d’Agriculture (bodies elected by the peasants to represent their interests before the government), and all-powerful government commissioners at all levels were rejected, and the proportion of members designated by the state trustees was reduced—all moves counter to the demands of the corporatists. <br><br>All the members of the peasant corporate national organizing committee, a provisional body, and its president, Hervé Budes de Guébriant, were named by the minister (Caziot), as were all the regional delegates, also provisional.

In France, its founder was René de La Tour du Pin and his <i>Vers un ordre social chrétien, Jalons de route 1882–1907 </i>(Toward a Christian Social Order, Blazing the Trail), which appeared in 1907. The best historical analysis of French corporatism is that of Matthew H. Elbow. <br><br>Corporatism was characterized by four traits. First of all, it did not seek to return to the corporations of the Old Regime (prior to the French Revolution), which were said to need replacement by the new. Accordingly, the term “neocorporatism” is often used for the twentieth-century varieties. Second, corporatists did not deny the reality of the Marxist class struggle but claimed to want to go beyond, or transcend, it. From this desire came the need for mixed <i>syndicats </i>(trade associations) grouping together bosses and workers, employers and employees. Third, corporatism was not opposed to syndicalism; instead, it sought to transform or perfect it. “The corporation is the profession having reached a higher form of organization,” Eugène Duthoit argued in 1942. The fourth characteristic of corporatism was to give, not total political power, but a regulatory and representational authority to the professions. Corporatists were not always in agreement nor very clear as to whether this power was to be given to a remodeled senate comprising representatives of the professions or whether a special body, separate from political institutions, was needed. <br><br>The coming of the Vichy government brought corporatism to the forefront of political consideration. Corporatists were numerous in the entourage of Pétain, who was persuaded that corporatism was a good third way between liberalism and Marxism. In the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, 15 September 1940, for example, Pétain wrote of the “need to organize professions on a corporative basis where all the elements of a business could meet, face each other, and settle things; the need to have in the heart of an organized profession, a representative of the state fully empowered to arbitrate otherwise irreconcilable differences; the need to have above and beyond the corporations or business communities a state organism empowered to guide national production, according to the possibilities of the domestic and foreign markets, thereby avoiding waste in labor and wealth.” <br><br>Corporatist tracts proliferated under Vichy as writers such as Maurice Bouvier- Ajam, Firmin Baconnier, M. H. Lenormand, and Louis Baudin attempted to bring the older doctrine into harmony with the France of the early 1940s. Duthoit, one such writer, argued that “precorporative” institutions had existed before the war but that true corporatist institutions had been created only after June 1940. Governmental attempts to put corporatist ideas into practice included provisional organizing committees for industrial production (law of 16 August 1940), a central office for distribution of industrial products (law of 10 September 1940), a corporative organization for agriculture (law of 2 December 1940), the Labor Charter (law of 4 October 1941 on the social organization of professions), and laws organizing specific professions, such as physicians (law of 7 October 1940) and architects (law of 31 December 1940). <br><br>The problem was that nearly all the French corporatists favored associational non-<i>étatiste </i>versions as opposed to one in which the state was all-powerful. Accordingly, they rejected German, Italian, Spanish, and even Portuguese models of corporatism, though the last more closely approximated their ideas. Associational corporatism, however, has never been put into practice. The circumstances of the Occupation in France made things even more difficult. All of the institutions created, even the Peasant Corporation (Corporation paysanne), the best among them, were controlled by the state. <br><br>L. Baudin, <i>Le Corporatisme </i>(Paris, 1942); M.

Promoted to admiral in 1929, he served as France’s naval expert at various international conferences. He also helped draw up a plan, approved in 1932, for the refurbishment of the navy. In 1937 he became naval commander. The principal naval theater for France, he concluded, would be in the Mediterranean against the Italians (and possibly the Spanish). <br><br>By 1939, Darlan was ready for war and saw his job as ensuring French access to the men and materials of its empire. The defeat of the army in 1940 enhanced this logic, for the “undefeated” navy and the French empire became doubly important, as the only bargaining chips a defeated France held. They also made the man responsible for them very important. On 16 June 1940 he became Marshal Pétain’s naval minister. From the start of the armistice period, Darlan gave standing orders to his crews to scuttle their ships, rather than surrender to anyone. <br><br>After Laval was fired on 13 December, Pétain needed someone to whom the Germans would talk. Darlan saw Hitler for a Christmas visit and, on 3 February 1941, visited Otto Abetz, the German ambassador in Paris. On 9 February, Pétain named him his heir apparent (replacing Laval), and he became the vice president of the Council of Ministers, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of information and, of course, continued as navy minister. Darlan argued for a policy of military neutrality, but economic cooperation with Germany. In search of a formal peace, he visited Hitler in May 1941, then, on 28–29 May, drew up the Protocols of Paris as a basis for normalized relations. They, however, never bore fruit. <br><br>After June 1941, all opposition was seen as communist-inspired and thus subject to the harshest repression. At the same time, Germany placed increasingly heavy demands on the French and their economy. To meet them, a new wave of regulations and laws was issued, all designed to ensure good order and governmental authority. Darlan had, however, failed to win major German concessions and was replaced by Laval on 17 April 1942. <br><br>Darlan, who commanded all Vichy forces after August 1941, had also been talking with the Allies. On 5 November he came to North Africa to visit his son, who had contracted polio. On 8 November the Allies, under cover of Operation Torch, also paid a visit. Darlan ordered resistance against the Allies. On 10 November he was taken prisoner but refused to order a cease-fire until the next day, when the Germans invaded the unoccupied rump of France. On 14 November Darlan joined the Allies, “inviting” the French fleet to sail to North Africa, but, instead, it was scuttled on 27 November. Without his fleet, Darlan’s value quickly dropped. On 24 December 1942 he was assassinated. Not many people mourned his passing. <br><br>While Darlan’s organizational skill was beyond doubt, his precise political leanings were anything but clear. It is perhaps easiest to understand him as a technocrat and a pragmatist: he looked for what “worked” and went with the prevailing political current, laying the foundation for a postwar France that would place great faith in the ability of a technical elite to solve its national problems. <br><br>*H.

By May 1944, as a result of the weakness of German forces in the region, the division was ordered to participate in the fight against the Resistance. Influenced by the intense National Socialist ideology of their Waffen-SS training and their experiences fighting in the east, the soldiers proceeded most brutally against the civilian population. <br><br>When, after learning of the invasion of 6 June 1944, the Resistance movements attacked the small occupation garrisons in the towns of Guéret and Tulle, the <i>Das Reich </i>division was ordered to take a detour from its march northward toward the Normandy front and fight the <i>maquis</i>. The story that the Resistance delayed a prompt arrival of the <i>Panzerdivision </i>at the Normandy front is not borne out by the facts.

The chief political columnist for the newspaper <i>L’OEuvre</i>, he also headed the Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP). Born in Guérigny in the Nièvre, Déat studied at the École Normale Supérieure, then in World War I received five citations for valor and rose from private to captain. Elected a deputy on the socialist ticket, he supported “order, authority, nation,” at the 1933 party congress, creating a split with Léon Blum. Déat, with Barthelémy Montagnon, Adrien Marquet, and 24 like-minded deputies, was expelled from the Socialist Party and in 1934 established the Parti Socialiste de France, better known as the “Neo-Socialists.” Déat called for state economic planning to fight the depression and a rapprochement with Germany. On 4 May 1939, as war threatened, <i>L’OEuvre </i>published his article “Faut-il mourir pour Dantzig?” (Must One Die for Danzig?), which asked why the French should be asked to save Danzig for Poland. <br><br>With the defeat of 1940, Déat tried to create a single mass party to support the new government of Marshal Pétain and Pierre Laval at Vichy. Failing, he returned in September to Paris, where he continued to write for <i>L’OEuvre </i>and, in February 1941, became, with Eugène Deloncle, a founding leader of the RNP. After surviving an assassination attempt in August of that year, for which he blamed Deloncle, Déat organized a purge of the RNP and became its uncontested leader for the duration of the war. Constantly chiding Vichy for being insufficiently “revolutionary” and too <i>“attentiste,” </i>he also quarreled with other collaborationist rivals, notably Jacques Doriot. Under German pressure, Déat was finally named minister of labor and national solidarity in March 1944, although his effectiveness was circumscribed by Laval and cut by the evolving war situation.

Catroux wished to continue the war under General de Gaulle’s leadership but believed he had to yield to Japanese demands to gain time.

Those whose naturalizations were canceled were listed in the <i>Journal Officiel </i>of the French State. Over 15,000 people were stripped of their French nationality and often were left stateless. Among them were children born in France who, under the 1927 law, were French citizens by right of being born on French soil. Original nationality seems to have been the most important factor in determining who was denaturalized. Italians and Poles accounted for half the total.

Contemporary evidence reveals the pervasiveness of informing. A Radio-Paris show, <i>Répétez-le </i>was devoted to denunciation letters. According to Jean Guéhenno, even the smallest hamlets had a “village snitch,” often the local head of the Légion Française des Combattants.<i>Délation </i>affected all levels of society. Vichy encouraged it as a social cleansing act, making it an acceptable civic duty. This explains the standard form of many letters, beginning: “I have the honor” and signed “a veteran” or “a patriot.” Motives for whistle-blowing included ideology but also personal rewards, revenge, and jealousy. The most famous wartime denunciation was the turning in of Jean Moulin, coordinator of the Resistance in 1943. Rather than being a German import, the practice of denunciation was indigenous to France. The French language counts no fewer than 36 colloquial terms for snitching. Informing had been widespread during the Revolution of 1789 and after the Commune of 1871. Wartime denunciations created an atmosphere of fear, which muted dissent under Vichy. As a personal manifestation of collaboration, they also facilitated the work of the occupier. They illustrate how latent hatreds and private rivalries under the Republic could become deadly and arbitrary tools of public repression under an authoritarian regime.

From 1943, however, the term “deportation” came to be used in a quite different sense as well, referring to the forcible transfer of French workers to work in Germany, beginning with the conscription of individuals in September 1942 and proceeding through drafts of entire age groups with the Service du Travail Obligatoire, set up in February of the following year. These “deportees,” eventually numbering over 600,000, were often termed “<i>déportés</i>“ or “<i>déportés de travail</i>.” Important because of their strategic and political significance, this category of persons sent to Germany attracted much more attention— notably by the BBC, which referred to them as “deportees” in broadcasts by the French Resistance—than those sent eastward as part of a repressive occupation policy.

Rich in gold, lumber, and rubber, AEF constituted an economic and military arsenal for the Allied effort. Named <i>Compagnon de la Libération</i>, Éboué mobilized the entire war effort of the territory, which he modernized at the same time. <br><br>In favor of the assimilation of the natives of the colonies, Éboué attempted to put his ideas into practice: his administrative directive “<i>Une Nouvelle politique indigène</i>“ in 1941 formed the basis of the 1944 Brazzaville Conference, which became the colonial policy of the Comité Français de la Libération Nationale. Exhausted by his five years of life overseas and work as governor-general of an AEF at war, Éboué died while on a visit to Cairo to rest. He is the only black to have the honor of burial at the Panthéon in Paris. <br><br>A. Maurice, “Félix-Adolphe-Sylvestre Éboué,” <i>Hommes et destins </i>1 (1972): 212–15; U.

Tizon-Germe</i><br><br>ECONOMY UNDER VICHY was an important dimension to the history of World War II France because (1) hardship and forced labor alienated ordinary people and drove some to active resistance, (2) state intervention increased, and (3) postwar inflation originated during the Occupation. <br><br>France’s economy from 1940 to 1944 was shaped by a combination of two factors. First, defeat and occupation truncated, disorganized, and impoverished the country. France was a vanquished nation, and its resources lay within reach of the victors. Second, Vichy tried to remodel the economy and respond to wartime circumstances of zonal division, restrictions on international trade, and transport difficulties. <br><br>As of 1940, Germany held directly the richest areas of France. Two-thirds of the population was under its rule. The occupied zones grew 72 percent of the country’s wheat, 78 percent of the barley, 80 percent of the oats; they produced 87 percent of the butter and 100 percent of the sugar; they raised 65 percent of the cattle. In the north were mined 76 percent of the coal and all the iron. Industry was concentrated there—95 percent of steel production, most of the mechanical engineering, and the manufacture of all textile goods. The unoccupied zone produced nearly all the wine, oil, soap, and bauxite. About 1.5 million French prisoners of war were in Germany; the labor force shrank, and with it overall production. The British blockade cut irreplaceable supplies. Petroleum, cotton, and wool were previously imported. So was one-third of the coal. Colonial commodities such as rice, coffee, and rubber stopped arriving. <br><br>German demands strained the French economy. Alongside outright plunder, several mechanisms siphoned the country’s wealth. The 1940 armistice stipulated that the costs of the army of occupation would be borne by France. On 18 August 1940, Germany unilaterally fixed the daily amount at 400 million francs, a huge levy, sufficient for the upkeep of 18 million men. The rate was lowered to 300 million (May 1941), then raised to 500 million (January 1943) and 700 million (June 1944). From June 1940 to August 1944, France paid 632 billion francs, plus 48 billion for lodging German troops and officials, in all, 10 times real occupation expenses and 46 percent of state expenditures. Over the five years, 11 percent, 19 percent, 21 percent, 37 percent, and 28 percent of national revenue went to Germany. The basic German device for pumping France’s resources was to buy them with money collected as tribute. <br><br>Purchasers were aided by the overvaluation of the mark at 20 francs, 8 more than was warranted. The “compensation accord” of 14 November 1940 regulated bilateral trade. In fact, Germany imported but did not export. The French clearinghouse paid French exporters with francs it did not possess, there being no payments to it by importers of German goods. The French treasury covered a deficit of 165 billion francs. <br><br>To gain a foothold in French companies, Germany used “Aryanization” as a lever. It also purchased shares. For instance, Mundus took a 47.6 percent interest in the Havas news and advertising agency in March 1941. I. G. Farben controlled the dye industry through Francolor, a company in which 49 percent of the equity was in French hands. Germany acquired French-owned mines in Yugoslavia and Poland and French holdings in Romanian oil and banks. Vichy authorities had to ensure economic survival in the face of daunting challenges. Gross production dropped regularly. Manufacturing and agricultural indexes fell to 44 and 69, respectively, in 1944 (1938 _ 100). Germany also drained an increasing volume of commodities. Shortages compressed national consumption and led to rationing, a price and wage freeze, and the growth of a black market. In reality, official prices of manufactured goods doubled; those of agricultural products tripled. Prices on the parallel market were from 2 to 30 times higher. Inflationary tensions mounted as the disparity between supply and demand widened. The authorities absorbed unusable purchasing power by issuing public loans. In any case, these loans were needed to bridge the gap between state revenues and expenditures. <br><br>The ills of the economy and the hemorrhaging provoked by transfers to Germany elicited responses aimed at staving off collapse and initiating long-range changes. The law of 16 August 1940 created the Comités d’organisation to assist business in taking stock of assets, programming production, and regulating activity sector by sector. In 1944, 234 committees were operational. On 10 September 1940, a law established an Office central de répartition des produits industriels (Central Office of Industrial Product Allocation) to allocate scarce resources. A ministère de la production industrielle came into being on 27 September 1940, followed by a Délégation générale de l’équipement national on 23 February 1941. The latter elaborated the Plan d’équipement national (February 1942) and the Tranche de démarrage (Bloc of Initiatives) (May 1944). For the first time, a state agency worked with large companies to draw up investment programs. But no firm targets were set, and no order of priorities determined. In the end, the plans were not implemented. <br><br>Notwithstanding officially sanctioned traditionalism and honors heaped on farmers and craftsmen, necessity led Vichy to give scope to modernizing technocrats such as Yves Bouthillier, René Belin, Jean Bichelonne, and François Lehideux. Economic policy was an odd mix of quasi <i>dirigisme </i>(quasi directivism) and near corporatism. Neither a type of state management of the economy nor one of corporatist self-management by all strata of a profession, the <i>Comités </i>fell under the control of big business. Small firms were marginalized, and employees excluded. A form of corporatism materialized in the Corporation paysanne created on 2 December 1940, but not in the Charte du travail enacted on 26 October 1941. Employee participation was confined to social services; economic matters remained in the hands of the employer-dominated <i>Comités</i>. In June 1940, the cabinet group headed by Pétain had sued for an armistice, indeed for peace, on the assumption that the war was over. Peace and the advent of a European New Order seemed imminent. When these forecasts proved wrong, provisional armistice terms became open-ended, extortionate arrangements. Hoping to restrain the occupiers, maintain the appearance of authority, and continue revamping French society, Vichy proposed collaboration in October 1940. It was a fateful step that set the course until 1944. Vichy settled into the role of willing partner, putting itself in the forefront, making German policy its own, even anticipating it. Far from hindering economic exploitation, Vichy facilitated it. <br><br>Blitzkrieg and expectations of rapid peace were scuttled by German defeats. The ensuing war economy required the mobilization of all of Europe’s resources. Relentlessly, Germany requisitioned the French labor force. Despite low wages at home, only 150,000 French workers volunteered to go to Germany from 1940 to 1942, and half of them returned. In May 1942, the Relève attracted one-fifth of the 250,000 men requested. On 4 September 1942, the Service du Travail Obligatoire instituted forced departures to Germany. Vichy assisted Germany throughout; prefects selected workers, and police rounded up runaways. State bodies intended to protect and reform the French economy became instruments for harnessing it to the German war machine. The <i>Comités </i>carried out German instructions transmitted by Vichy. French companies worked largely to fill orders for the Wehrmacht or as subcontractors for German companies. In 1944— until the liberation—Germany took all aircraft built, 80 percent of public works, 78 percent of ships, 77 percent of automobiles, and 65 percent of rubber items and paint produced. <br><br>From 1940 to 1944, France provided Germany with one-third of the supplies and 42 percent of the financial revenues it drew from occupied Europe, a proportion unequaled by any other country. <br><br>*†A.

It also printed a translation of John Steinbeck’s <i>The Moon Is Down</i>. Minuit’s goal was to print and distribute uncensored essays, fiction, and poetry by French authors writing in occupied France.

By 1944, the novel had been reprinted by the Free French forces exiled in London, where Cyril Connolly’s English translation brought it worldwide attention.

case 332: $("div#commentary").html('<b>EDUCATION UNDER VICHY</b> was characterized by a Vichy position that laid much of the blame for France’s defeat in 1940 on its “secular” and “bookish” educational system. Marshal Pétain and his followers placed particular blame on the Third Republic’s free and universal primary schools, its teachers (<i>instituteurs</i>), and their labor union (Syndicat National des Instituteurs). Pétain’s aide René Benjamin had asserted that unionized <i>instituteurs</i>, along with café owners, were, essentially, secular and left-wing demagogues. Long concerned with educational reform, Pétain himself discoursed on the problem in a 1941 essay collection. Schools, he argued, must educate students to fit within the family, society, and nation, with both the Catholic Church and the army playing vital roles in this task. In short, he believed that France must develop a “national education” rather than “public instruction” and must strive also “to develop physical strength, temper the heart, and forge the will.” These sentiments became distilled in a program of “general education” that was to include not only a renewed emphasis on Catholicism but also a new stress on artistic activities and physical training. <br><br>A succession of ministers of education (an unprecedented six in four years) tried simultaneously to dismantle the Republican system and implement a “national” one. All the ministers were conservative, but their ideology was no antidote to the crosscurrents bedeviling the regime. The first, Sorbonne professor Albert Rivaud, appointed on 17 June 1940, was dismissed after less than a month for his outspoken opposition to the Nazis. Émile Mireaux, a senator and codirector of the newspaper <i>Le Temps</i>, held the post only slightly longer—seven weeks—because Pétain distrusted parliamentarians. Next came Georges Ripert, dean of the Paris law faculty, who established the foundations for national education. He abolished the primary teaching colleges (<i>écoles normales</i>), their consulting bodies, and the teachers’ union, replacing these bodies with Instituts de Formation Professionnelle and state-controlled professional associations. Despite Ripert’s professed allegiance, Pétain suspected him of being loyal to Laval, and when the latter fell from power on 13 December 1940, Ripert also was dismissed. Ripert’s successor, Jacques Chevalier, represented Catholic influence at its crest. This general’s son, trained as a philosopher, had founded during the 1930s a right-wing schoolteachers’ association and now reintroduced religious education in state primary schools and granted subsidies to Catholic schools. These moves caused such a storm of protest among the teachers, with consequent unease among the Nazis, that Pétain had to remove Chevalier after less than two months in office. <br><br>In February 1941 Pétain appointed the minister who proved to have the most dramatic impact on education: Jérôme Carcopino, a professor of ancient Roman history at the Sorbonne. Skillfully navigating between the Catholics and the collaborators on the question of Catholicism in education, Carcopino moderated, against Pétain’s wishes, the zeal of his predecessors. He rescinded the right to teach Catholic dogma or display its symbols in public schools and ended state subsidies to Catholic schools. These positions, satisfying neither Catholics nor secularists, did not end the turmoil produced by Chevalier’s reforms. Carcopino stood steadfast against the efforts of collaborators to destroy the autonomy of French education. For example, he did not purge the College de France of communists and Freemasons, as many collaborators wished, nor did he promote the persecution of these groups or their removal from the rest of the educational system. <br><br>Carcopino’s most important reforms, known as the “<i>réforme Carcopino,</i>” involved the transformation of the secondary system. Again he strove for the middle ground among the warring factions. On one hand, his law of 15 August 1941 restored the elitism and classicism of the <i>lycées </i>by reimposing tuition and restoring the mandatory teaching of Greek and Latin. On the other hand, some of his reforms moved in the direction supported by the Popular Front education minister Jean Zay and the post-1945 reforms, mitigating the elitism of the <i>lycées </i>by creating the <i>diplôme des études primaires préparatoires </i>(DÉPP), which permitted bright students from the mass primary schools to obtain scholarships to the <i>lycée</i>. The law of 15 August 1941 upgraded the secondary education of the upper primary schools (<i>écoles primaires superieurs</i>) by turning them into <i>collè ges </i>that concentrated on modern languages and technical education. With the return of Laval to power and the growing interference of the Nazis in Vichy affairs, Carcopino was ousted and replaced by Abel Bonnard, salonist and writer, in April 1942. Bonnard, who had been involved in the Maurresian educational group Cercle Fustel de Coulanges, would hold this post until August 1944, making him both the last and longest-serving Vichy education minister. <br><br>Long on rhetoric, Bonnard articulated Vichy axioms, such as bringing education closer to life through increased emphasis on technical education, but he was short on action. True to his collaborationist inclinations, he was the first minister of education to speak openly of politicizing the profession and devoted much of his effort to helping the German war effort. (Laval is rumored to have quipped that Bonnard was more German than the Germans.) To this end he authorized, first, the spying on, and subsequent rounding up of, communists; second, the wearing of the “<i>francisque,</i>“ a Vichy honor symbol, in schools; and, third, the renewed purging of “unacceptable teachers.” In general, this crackdown affected primary teachers more than secondary teachers. <br><br>In general, Vichy’s grandiose aims for education were stillborn. Teachers, to say nothing of students, turned a cold shoulder to Vichy’s moral and religious call to arms. In addition, the church never regained its pre-1789 influence. At the liberation, Carcopino’s reforms were swept out, but his <i>collèges </i>proved to be a prototype of the “<i>école moyenne</i>“—serving as the transition between primary and secondary education—realized by the Christian Fouchet and René Haby reforms after 1945. <br><br>*†B.

Its objectives were to raise money and to secure the safety of well-known European artists, intellectuals, and politicians. With the assistance of the Museum of Modern Art’s Alfred Barr, Jr., his wife, Margaret Barr, Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, Frank Kingdon, and several other prestigious advisers, a list was compiled of those persons with the most immediate need to escape from France due to the “surrender on demand” clause in Article 19 of the Franco–German armistice.<br><br>Varian Fry (1907–1967), a former Harvard classics scholar and editor, volunteered to direct the Marseilles-based ERC operations. He arrived there on 15 August 1940 with a list of 200 names and $3,000. Needing a legal cover for this illegal rescue operation, the Centre Américain de Secours (CAS) was established to aid needy refugees with food, money, and lodging. Despite dwindling funds, tightening of border regulations, increasing harassment from Gestapo and Vichy officials, and a lack of cooperation from American officials, Fry, with a small staff, was able to procure forged exit visas, identification cards, financial assistance, and underground escape routes to help many of the threatened cultural luminaries flee the Vichy and Nazi governments. <br><br>Between the fall of 1940 and August 1941, the ERC organized the escape of approximately 1,500 people, including Heinrich Mann, Franz Werfel, Marc Chagall, Jacques Lipchitz, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, André Breton, Hannah Arendt, and Lion Feuchtwanger. On 29 August 1941, Fry was arrested by agents of the Sûreté Nationale for protecting Jews and anti-Nazis as well as for assisting the political enemies of France. A few days later, he was escorted to the border and expelled from France with the approval of both the American and French governments. The committee’s activities, however, did not end with Fry’s departure. Daniel Bénédite, Fry’s chief aid, managed to keep the ERC and CAS going. He successfully procured overseas passage for some 300 additional people, including Jean Malaquais, Wanda Landowska, Mané Katz, Moise Kisling, and Marcel Duchamp, who sailed out of Marseilles in May 1942, the last client of the ERC. <br><br>Altogether the ERC provided various forms of assistance to more than 4,000 people, as well as smuggling some 300 British servicemen out of France, all without the help of Vichy or the American State Department. Both, according to Fry, greatly hindered the ERC’s operations. On 12 April 1967, Fry was awarded the Croix du Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor for his efforts in rescuing the cultural figures of Europe during World War II. <br><br>D.

case 334: $("div#commentary").html('<b>EMPIRE, OVERSEAS,</b> became a major object of contention between Vichy France and Free France during the war. At the outset of the conflict the empire was expected to play a major role in supplying troops and resources to sustain a long-term French war effort. With the collapse of the northeastern front in May–June 1940, Premier Paul Reynaud entertained the possibility of continued resistance from overseas, and 26 deputies and a senator left Bordeaux for Morocco aboard the SS <i>Massilia</i>. Several colonial governors and military leaders, such as General Auguste Noguès in Morocco, Governor-General Georges Le Beau in Algeria, and High Commissioner Gabriel Puaux and General Eugène Mittelhauser in Syria, initially considered continuing the war but rejected the idea when Marshal Pétain, who had replaced Reynaud, signed an armistice and insisted on obedience. Only General Georges Catroux in Indochina decided to continue but resigned without rallying the colony to the cause of General de Gaulle.<br><br>Subsequently, parts of the empire rallied to the Free French, beginning with Governor Henri Sautot in the New Hebrides and continuing with rallies in Equatorial Africa led by Governor Félix Éboué in Chad. With the addition of Gabon in November all of French Equatorial Africa had joined the Free French. Pondicherry and the other French enclaves in India rallied quickly to the Free French, and Tahiti joined them in September 1940. The Americans subsequently set up a base on Bora Bora in French Polynesia. In the French West Indies the black population favored the Free French, but Admiral Georges Robert, the high commissioner, repressed any signs of dissidence. There would be no further rallies until a British–Free French force ousted the Vichy regime from Syria and Lebanon in July 1941, and a Free French expedition liberated St. Pierre and Miquelon in December that year. <br><br>The empire was one of the main bargaining counters that Vichy held in negotiating with Germany, and Vichy officials played this chip at every opportunity but obtained few advantages. Although the empire was to be neutral according to the armistice, Admiral Darlan granted Germany landing rights in Syria and allowed supplies to reach General Erwin Rommel by way of Tunisia. Vichy drew up plans to reconquer the African colonies that had rallied to de Gaulle, requesting that the German armistice commission allow reinforcement of French troops for the purpose. Admiral Jean Decoux proposed that Japanese forces assist in the recovery of the Free French colonies in the Pacific. Vichy policy toward the empire was one of preservation in the face of defeat. Loyalty and obedience were expected, and measures were introduced to assert Vichy’s New Order in the empire. Anti-Semitic legislation reached North Africa, where revocation of the Crémieux decrees abrogated Jewish citizenship, and institutions of the National Revolution, such as the Légion Française des Combattants, also appeared in the empire. In West Africa forced labor was reintroduced. In Indochina Decoux offered Vietnamese elites a wider role in the administration and created a Vietnamese advisory board, but these were limited gains designed to counter Japanese propaganda and to undermine Vietnamese nationalism. <br><br>Some Vichy reformers considered investment in the empire a source for the renewal of France, but lack of resources foreclosed plans for an imperial “industrialization.” Trade with the empire declined to two-thirds of its prewar level as a result of the British blockade. Imperial goods that reached metropolitan France increasingly served German requirements. Vichy’s version of an imperial mission for France remained largely propaganda rhetoric for metropolitan consumption, expressed through “colonial weeks,” films, and radio broadcasts that were laced with denunciations of perfidious Albion and Yankee imperialists. With the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942, Vichy lost its imperial card and any claim to imperial glory, although Vichy officials continued to propose imperial reforms throughout 1943. From Vichy’s perspective both defeat at the hands of the Axis and the successful Anglo- American invasion of North Africa undermined French imperial prestige. The “dissident” empire provided de Gaulle with a territorial basis for his claim that France remained in the war despite the armistice. Yet the empire proved a cause of contention between the Allies. The Free French, no less than Vichy, considered British and American actions threats to French imperial sovereignty. The Anglo–Free French operation in Syria ended in recrimination when the British commander negotiated a settlement with Vichy authorities that excluded the Gaullists, and a British force liberated Madagascar without consulting de Gaulle in advance. Although the British turned over control of Syria and Madagascar to the Free French, suspicion of British intentions remained. The United States’ entry into the war raised further alarms over the status of the French empire. De Gaulle hoped that Free French control of strategic territories would gain American recognition of them as trustees of French sovereignty. After Pearl Harbor, de Gaulle agreed to allow American bases to be established on Free French territory in Africa and in the Pacific. In turn the Americans extended Lend-Lease to the Free French, recognized Free French authority in the administration of territories that joined de Gaulle, and promised a postwar restoration of French sovereignty over all areas held in 1939. Despite such promises, Roosevelt became convinced that the era of empire was ending and that France, particularly Gaullist France, should not be allowed to regain full control of its prewar empire. He proposed that strategic parts of the empire, including Dakar, Bizerte, New Caledonia, and Indochina, be placed under a trustee arrangement. At the Casablanca Conference, Roosevelt expressed support for an independent Morocco to the sultan. At Teheran Roosevelt and Stalin agreed that France should not be allowed to retain Indochina, and Roosevelt indicated that parts of France’s colonial empire should become part of an internationalized system after the war. By the end of the war, Roosevelt’s anticolonialism yielded to American recognition that loss of empire would weaken France as an ally, but the Gaullists’ wartime fears of American policies persisted. De Gaulle recognized that the empire’s contribution to France’s recovery and liberation required a revision of the prewar imperial structure. Troops from the empire made up the bulk of General Leclerc’s forces, of French combatants in the Tunisian campaign, of General Alphonse Juin’s Expeditionary Force in Italy, and of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny’s army in Provence. The parts of the empire that had joined de Gaulle had been taxed to defray the costs of rearmament and to support the Free French administration. The empire had been instrumental in the restoration of French prestige, and de Gaulle recognized the imperial contribution in several wartime speeches in which he promised a large measure of autonomy for the colonies. In the Brazzaville Conference of January– February 1944 he proposed the formation of a less centralized French Union. <br><br>Brazzaville implied a more liberal imperial rule, but the promise fell short of expectations, reflected in a series of challenges that de Gaulle’s Provisional Government faced at the war’s end. On the day that the German surrender was signed in Europe, nationalist demonstrations in Algeria brought swift repression, and the sudden end of the war in the Pacific produced a power vacuum in Indochina that Ho Chi Minh filled by proclaiming an autonomous Vietnam, another expectation denied when the Provisional Government reasserted French authority. The empire provided Free France with the means of redemption, but liberation of metropolitan France was not liberation for the empire. Retention of the empire became necessary for a postwar French assertion of power and grandeur amid the gathering storm of the cold war. <br><br>*C.-R.

Arletty, who acted in many of them, was the star of the movies they made under Vichy. But the cinema of the Occupation, with very few exceptions, left current realities aside and focused on the filming of nineteenth-century novels and on escape into fantasy. The best example of the latter was the Carné-Prévert <i>Visiteurs du soir </i>(1942).<br><br><i>Les enfants du paradis </i>is a complex and deeply romantic story of love and frustration—four men gravitating around Garance (Arletty)—that takes place in the world of theater and pantomime, Boulevard du Temple, in the 1820s and 1830s; three of the men—the mime Baptiste Deburau (Jean-Louis Barrault), the actor Frédéric Lemaître (Pierre Brasseur), and the dandy assassin P. F. Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand)—had been “real characters.” The movie’s filming began in August 1943 and took place mainly in Nice. It was interrupted when the Germans occupied Nice in September 1943 and did not resume until February 1944. It ended just before D-Day, but Carné did not want to release the film before the complete liberation of France, and it had its premiere on 9 March 1945. Despite its length (3 1⁄2 hours), it became a huge success and a symbol of the vitality of French art. But this spectacular and costly historical romance had been affected by the vicissitudes of the “Franco-French war.” On one hand, as in the case of <i>Les Visiteurs du soir</i>, two of the Jewish collaborators of Prévert and Carné, the composer Joseph Kosma and the set designer Alexandre Trauner, had to work for the film clandestinely. On the other hand, the collaborationist actor Robert Le Vigan fled to Germany before completing his part and had to be replaced (by Pierre Renoir); as for Arletty, she was charged with having had a long affair with a Luftwaffe officer, was purged after the liberation, and was in jail when the movie came out. It was the next-to-last of the Carné-Prévert films and the last of their triumphs. Their return to poetic realism in <i>Les portes de la nuit </i>(1946)—which deals with the Occupation and its effects—was a flop. <br><br>M.

In 1941 <i>Esprit </i>prospered, having almost doubled its circulation, but Action Française jealousy helped silence it in late summer 1941.

Along with <i>Le Monde </i>and the publishing firm Les Éditions du Seuil it drew progressive Catholics and other antimaterialist communitarians, as it promoted anti-individualism, anti-Americanism, <i>tiers-mondisme </i>(Third Worldism), and openness to the communist movement. <br><br>J.

While Esteva might have been an officer of the “old school,” displaying a clear devotion to following orders, politically he was untried and ill suited to his role. At the time of the Anglo-American landings (Operation Torch) in November 1942, although there was some confusion about whose authority he should obey, Esteva followed orders from the Vichy government and was forced to allow German and Italian reinforcements, aircraft, and equipment to land at Tunis and Bizerta.

In theory, the regime’s authority extended also to the northern, occupied zone, but its actions there were always subject to the German authorities in Paris. The État Français continued to claim the status of a legal government throughout the Occupation, even though the Germans occupied Vichy’s “free” zone in November 1942. <br><br>Though born of military defeat, the Vichy regime was not a puppet government; it was constituted by a vote in the National Assembly (10 July 1940) suspending the Republican constitution and vesting full powers in the new head of state, Marshal Pétain, to draw up a constitution. In adopting the term “French State,” the Vichy government sought to distinguish itself from the French Republic, a distinction that it reinforced by replacing the Republican triad <i>Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité </i>(liberty, equality, fraternity) with the new motto of <i>Travail, Famille, Patrie </i>(work, family, fatherland). <br><br>The État Français began with a level of legitimacy and popular acceptance that it was never to attain again. It retained control over the fleet and most parts of the empire and received broad diplomatic recognition. Inside France Pétain was revered as a national savior, and his political program, termed the “National Revolution,” capitalized on widespread revulsion at the previous regime. With only Britain standing between Hitler and total victory, the war appeared definitively lost, and the Vichy government’s policy of accepting the inevitable seemed the only realistic one. <br><br>These favorable indications for Vichy did not last long. Though Pétain’s personal prestige remained high well beyond 1940, popular enthusiasm for his regime eroded considerably within a year. The unanticipated continuation of the war undermined the fundamental assumptions of the regime. The National Revolution, which began with pretensions to a moral and patriotic renewal, revealed itself to be mostly concerned with settling political scores with the Republic, the Popular Front, and the traditional <i>bêtes noires </i>of the Right (labor unions, communists, Freemasons, immigrants, and Jews). Though a range of ideological viewpoints, including left-wing and technocratic as well as traditionalist, vied for control in Vichy, the regime’s inclinations were fundamentally reactionary and divisive. Nothing illustrated this better than the anti-Jewish legislation enacted in the fall of 1940 without pressure from Germany. <br><br>Still more damaging to the État Français was its protracted effort to exploit the naval and strategic assets that it—alone among German-occupied nations— retained in order to negotiate a favorable accommodation with Hitler. The mirage of a mutually beneficial “collaboration” drew Vichy governments (notably those led by Pierre Laval and Admiral Darlan) into compromising, unpopular, and essentially fruitless negotiations with the Nazis. <br><br>After Laval returned to power in April 1942, the État Français moved toward closer cooperation with Germany, initiating the deportation of foreign Jews from France, adopting increasingly draconian measures against the Resistance, and sending French civilians to work in Germany. In the last year of its existence, the regime waded ever deeper into repression, and extremist collaborators such as Joseph Darnand, Philippe Henriot, and Marcel Déat entered the government. <br><br>At the liberation, the members of the government, including Pétain, were transported to the German castle of Sigmaringen. It was a pathetic end to a regime that had been launched amid unfounded hopes of making the best of a disaster but ended up exacerbating French divisions and discrediting the French State even further. <br><br>J.-P.

After the outlawing of Freemasonry on 13 August 1940, the first anti-Masonic exposition was opened at the Petit Palais in Paris in October 1940. Highly graphic and supposed to represent scientific observation, its front door poster announced, “You will find inside neither lies nor insults, only facts and evidence.” The exposition showed the interiors of lodges, initiation rites, triangles, skulls, liturgical ornaments and vestments, and related accessories. An accompanying brochure contained lists of Freemasons, who were said to be strangling France. <br><br>A similar anti-Semitic exposition was organized by the Institut d’Études des Questions Juives at the Paris Palais Berlitz in September 1941 in order to sensitize youth to the mythical Jewish power. With free admission for school groups and the unemployed, the exposition was arranged in a pedagogical way that featured visual aids stressing the so-called disastrous impact of Jews in all French public domains, including literature, entertainment, the economy, and politics. It included life-size pictures of French Jewish personalities, a gigantic fresco stereotyping Hebrew history, and excerpts from the Talmud supposedly illustrating Jewish supremacy, as well as enlarged photographs of extracts of the 14 June 1941 discriminatory legislation against the Jews. <br><br>The exposition was accompanied by a booklet signed by Jean Marquès Riviè re and prefaced by the secretary of the institute, Captain Paul Sézille, that implied a complete and objective presentation of the Jews. This booklet traced the history of the Jews, focusing on supposedly racial and religious characteristics. It denounced the mythical Jewish “type,” suggesting that “Jewishness” would always prevail over national citizenship, thereby rendering the assimilation of Jews impossible.

On 20 June 1940, Marshal Pétain declared that the war had been lost because there had been “too few children, too few arms, too few Allies.” The belief that the women of France had “neglected” their duty to the state by not producing enough children was central to Vichy family policy. Proponents of the National Revolution often equated childbirth with military service. Government publications referred to the mother as the “privileged worker” who would rebuild the nation. Childbearing offered women an opportunity to redeem themselves and ensure the future of France. The problems posed by the fact that almost 2 million Frenchmen were captive in Germany were largely ignored. <br><br>The Vichy press embarked upon a campaign to help carry out government efforts to strengthen and increase the family. Sensitive to possible comparisons with Germany, Vichy claimed its natalist policy was moral and conservative, in contrast to the former’s racial and secular approach. To compensate for the heavy casualties of World War I, a law had been passed in 1920 banning contraception; another, in 1923, condemned abortion. Vichy strengthened this already severe legislation. Abortion was classified as a crime against the state, hence subject to the death penalty. At least one woman abortionist (a mother) was guillotined. To protect the dignity of the home, Vichy passed a law in 1942 dealing specifically with adultery involving the wife of a prisoner of war, considered a more serious offense than “ordinary” adultery. Divorce became more difficult to obtain. <br><br>Vichy extended financial benefits of the 1939 Family Code that favored families with three or more children. Mothers of large families received supplementary rations and preferential treatment—in food queues, for example—along with medals and their pictures in local papers. Fathers of large families were to receive job preference, while bachelors were penalized. The Catholic Church hierarchy applauded the imposition of measures intended to bolster the family. A General Commission on the Family (Commissariat Général à la Famille) to coordinate family policies was set up, but it was severely handicapped by German demands. Early in October 1940, Vichy instituted laws prohibiting a married woman from government work if her husband’s salary was deemed adequate (a term never fully defined). However, the increasing manpower shortage soon forced Vichy to reverse its policies and urge women to work outside the home, even ordering a census of all unmarried women aged 18 to 45 deemed capable of undertaking work judged “useful to the higher interest of the nation.” Adverse circumstances, including the absence of hundreds of thousands of male heads of families as prisoners of war in Germany, obliged Pétain to change some provisions of the paternalistic Napoleonic Code in women’s favor. Women’s legal incapacity was ended, although the husband remained lawful head of the household. <br><br>Early on Pétain had proclaimed that the family, as the central social structure, was the essential foundation of the nation. If it gave way, he maintained, all was lost. Yet as the Occupation progressed, French families were increasingly separated, not strengthened; his government’s policies proved largely inadequate to meet its own proclaimed goals. <br><br>A.

The term has since come to refer to political movements extolling nation or race, with a centralized authoritarian government headed by a dictator regimenting society and suppressing opposition. <br><br>Historians are divided over the degree to which the term is generic, referring to a variety of movements in different countries from the end of World War I through the end of World War II, and whether it can also apply to political movements in the post-1945 world, or whether it should be limited in use only to those movements that applied the term to themselves, notably the Italian Fascists. Because of the popular association of “fascism” with responsibility for World War II and the Holocaust, the term has become a political epithet, used often to slander one’s opponents. <br><br>Historians also disagree as to what extent France produced fascist movements and whether or not the Vichy État Français was fascist. René Rémond has argued that French political traditions of royalism, Bonapartism, and counterrevolution were not fascist and that whatever fascism France did produce, for example, Georges Valois’ mid-1920s Faisceau and the Parti Populaire Franc ¸ais (PPF) of 1936–1945, was the result of imported influences. Zeev Sternhell, on the contrary, argued that a late-nineteenth-century synthesis of socialism and nationalism in the ideas of Georges Sorel and others produced in France the ideas that helped give rise to interwar fascism. <br><br>Historians have also quarreled over the fascist credentials of the Vichy government, with Roger Bourderon suggesting that there was a logic of fascism inherent in Vichy, which was fully manifest in the police state of 1944. Most, however, have argued that, because it lacked a single mass party similar to the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis, Vichy was more conservative or counterrevolutionary than fascist. The more extreme collaborationist movements, such as the Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP), the PPF, and the Milice Française, generally eschewed the term “fascism.” RNP leader Marcel Déat, for example, referred to his movement more as “national socialism” than as “fascist.”<br><br>R.

Prestigious houses, such as those of Gabrielle Chanel and Madeleine Vionnet, closed. The influence of military dress was felt in the 1939– 1940 winter collections, while a fashion of practicality made its appearance: severe cuts, “Alert” pajamas (to be worn in comfort and style in air raid shelters), and neutral colors. <br><br>The realities of the Occupation followed soon after the defeat. In the summer of 1940, the Reich proclaimed its intention to integrate French haute couture into a German structure with headquarters in Berlin or Vienna. The head of the haute couture syndical organization, Lucien Lelong, aware of a patrimony to safeguard and a savoir faire to protect, managed to prevent this transfer. However, the number of “authorized” houses of couture diminished consistently, from 85 in June 1941 to some 50 in 1943, as did the dresses presented in the collections (75 in 1942, 60 in 1944). Through the Comité d’organisation, Vichy imposed a measurement on each haute couture design, while the length of the hems and the making of the garments themselves were debated. Some 20,000 women benefited from a special couture designer card that gave them the right to procure clothing at the grand couturiers. <br><br>Fashion adapted to the context of penury: the bicycle, returned to honor due to the lack of other transport, necessitated suitable outfits (divided skirts). To replace stockings in the summer, women colored their legs with a lotion. With the scarcity of leather, boot makers used wooden soles while staple fiber and rayon replaced linen and cotton. Milliners rivaled the elegance of the theater and cinema in imagination with turbans, cavaliers’ hats, felt brims with flowers or fruits, birds, tiny <i>bibis </i>(from styles of the 1830s); all was possible.

A week later, Czechoslovakia’s acceptance of the Munich agreement, yielding the Sudetenland, forestalled a German invasion but terminated the Franco–Czechoslovak alliance and made the remnant of Czecho-Slovakia a Nazi satellite. <br><br>Faucher subsequently opposed appeasement in France, accusing <i>Je suis partout </i>and other right-wing papers of knowingly or unknowingly assisting Nazi/ fascist propaganda efforts. After the outbreak of war the French government recalled him from retirement to help form a Czechoslovak army in France, which saw action in the May–June 1940 campaign. In the chaos of defeat, Faucher disobeyed the new Pétain government’s order to disband his mission and instead facilitated the Czechoslovaks’ escape via the southern port of Sète, saving them from a Nazi firing squad. <br><br>During the Occupation, Faucher took a leading role in the Resistance in his native Deux-Sèvres, commanding the Secret Army in southwest France (Region B) and working closely with Libération nord, the Alliance network, and the Organisation Civile et Militaire. The Gestapo arrested him on 29 January 1944 and deported him first to Bad Godesberg and then to Plansee in the Tyrol. American troops freed the 70-year-old Faucher on 7 May 1945. After repatriation he spent the rest of his life working toward Franco–Czechoslovak friendship and the advocacy of human rights in communist-controlled Czechoslovakia. A Protestant general of peasant origins and Republican convictions, Louis Eugène Faucher personifies the resistance to appeasement in 1938 that anticipated resistance to capitulation and collaboration after 1940. <br><br>M.

He never recanted his views and continued to pass off his self-righteous narrow-mindedness (he refused to testify for Blum at his 1942 trial in Riom) as noble principle.

Some units were able to pay for requisitioned goods with cash; others used notes or coupons guaranteeing payment to the bearer after the liberation. Not all units felt obligated to offer payment to collaborators for goods taken from them.

After the liberation, police continued to investigate complaints against “<i>faux-maquisards</i>“ and to bring them to trial.

Fay¨ also established the Centre de Documentation Contemporaine, which was given the task of collecting documents from Masonic lodges dissolved by law of 13 August 1940.

Furthermore, Fay¨’s extremism distanced him even from other members of the Catholic Right, for example, General Augustin Laure protested when Fay¨ claimed that the bishop of Orléans was under Masonic influence. <br><br>For all his ideological fervor, Fay¨ engaged largely in standard bureaucratic work during the Vichy period. He arranged to send 3 million books to French prisoners of war in Germany and endured the sniping of the <i>Revue Historique</i>, which believed that Masonic documents ought to have been deposited in the Archives Nationales. His attempts to centralize the administration of French libraries fit in with longer-term strategies of senior administrators: his 1943 report on the subject quoted extensively from the report written by Julien Caı¨n in 1940 and was itself eventually published by Caı¨n after the latter’s return to the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1945.

It sponsored a variety of social, cultural, and educational activities, inspired by Jewish traditions brought from Eastern Europe. In the late 1930s, when some 20,000 families were direct or indirect members, it was chaired by the socialist Zionist leader, Marc Jarblum. Its very existence reflected the complex and problematic relationship between immigrant and native- born French Jews (<i>israélites</i>).<br><br>With the Occupation in 1940, large numbers of Jews and all the major Jewish organizations left Paris. Only a few unofficial organizations of the immigrant Jews continued their social assistance work. Preeminent among these was the newly created Committee of the “rue Amelot,” which included the Fédération and most of Paris Jewish immigrant political parties, except for the communists. In November 1941, under German pressure, the French government instituted the Union général des israélites en France (UGIF), a single umbrella organization to which all Jews were required to belong. Jarblum and other Fédération leaders refused to take part, although some cooperation between the underground Fédération and the official and state-controlled UGIF did exist. <br><br>The Fédération in the southern zone and “rue Amelot” in Paris both worked most importantly to help the impoverished Jews, many living clandestinely and lacking their pre-1940 sources of income. This financial help permitted many trapped immigrant families to survive. The Fédération also helped finance youth movement rescue activities, and some local branches helped falsify identity papers. Sources of income came mainly either legally from the UGIF or illegally from the American Joint Distribution Committee, the Zionist Organization, and the World Jewish Congress in Switzerland.

case 358: $("div#commentary").html('<b>FICTION IN LITERATURE RELATED TO OCCUPIED FRANCE.</b> World War II and the Nazi Occupation have been the subjects of considerable French literary fiction in the second half of the twentieth century. This literature reflects the perspectives of successive ideologies as they look back to the wartime period. Few texts dealing with the Occupation were published before the liberation, the most important of which remains the <i>Silence de la Mer </i>by Vercors (1942), which recounts the power of silence as a means of opposition to the German presence in the occupied zone. Postwar literary currents were mainly autobiographical and testimonial, with texts bearing witness to the Nazi presence in France, such as <i>Les Années noires </i>(1947), Jean Guéhenno’s diary during the German presence in Paris; Jean-Louis Bory’s <i>Mon Village à l’heure allemande </i>(1945), an account of French passivity in the face of the German invasion; and <i>Le Premier accroc coûte deux cents francs </i>by Elsa Triolet (1947), inspired by Resistance activities. <br><br>Most immediate postwar fiction was inspired by a search for truth and a desire to set records straight. Some distanced themselves from factual information and personal memory to consider broader issues raised during the Occupation. Among these were Albert Camus’ <i>La Peste </i>(1947), one of the only allegories of the period, and Simone de Beauvoir’s <i>Le Sang des autres </i>(1944), a didactic novel focusing on the ethics of militancy. Jean-Paul Sartre’s writings, <i>L’Huisclos </i>(1944), <i>La Putain respectueuse </i>(1946), and <i>Les Mains sales </i>(1948), also inspired by the trauma of the Occupation, reflected political commitment to freedom, although the wartime experience was not directly treated. Often with irony or cynicism, other fiction examined passive collaboration and the black market during the Occupation. <i>Au bon beurre </i>(1952) by Jean Dutourd and Marcel Aymé’s <i>Le Chemin des écoliers </i>(1946) and <i>Uranus </i>(1948) denounced self-interest in times of restrictions. <i>La Bâtarde </i>by Violette Leduc (1964) addressed issues of indifference and survival by any means. <br><br>New Wave novelists, who were either children during the Occupation or born after 1945, have more recently turned to the ambiguities of the Occupation years and the stories of their parents involved in the politics of the period. Among them are Jean-Michel Bloch with <i>Daniel et Noémie </i>(1971), Pascal Jardin, whose narratives <i>La Guerre à neuf ans </i>(1971) and <i>Le Nain jaune </i>(1978) rely on personal childhood memories, and Joseph Joffo with <i>Un Sac de billes </i>(1978). Most important, Patrick Modiano’s novels, such as <i>La Place de l’Étoile </i>(1968) and <i>Voyage de noces </i>(1991) and, less so, <i>Villa triste </i>(1972), evoke both collaboration and the problems of coherence in memory. <br><br>These more recent novels, sometimes called “retro,” acknowledge the weight of narrative technique in the account of “lived” experience, ignored by earlier accounts and by historical texts. They also attack the good conscience typical of the Gaullist era, evoking the interconnection of persons and events during the Occupation, as did also Serge Doubrovsky’s <i>La Dispersion </i>(1969), which denounced French hypocrisy and complicity in the Aryanization process. During the last 50 years in France, the Occupation and, more generally the Nazi experience have been used as a background to discuss human relationships to problems of war, power, and social, racial, and religious ethics, as well as connections between individual and collective histories. <br><br>M.

The term originated during the Spanish civil war (1936–1939), when, as General Franco’s forces laid siege to Madrid, commanding officer General Emilio Mola referred to a “fifth column” that would sabotage the city’s defenses and help his forces, marching in four columns, take the city. <br><br>Many of those who lived through the Occupation recall a general fear of spies or traitors who were supposed to be working for the Third Reich and sabotaging the war effort in the early days of the war. Historians such as Jean-Pierre Azéma believe there is little proof of a widespread presence of Nazi spies in France during the Phoney War, but he does point to the negative effect French Nazis had on general morale, for example, Paul Ferdonnet on Radio-Stuttgart, who repeated Goebbels’ words that “the English would fight to the last Frenchman.” Few future collaborators sided with such attacks on the war effort. Most spoke more openly for Germany only after the defeat. <br><br>Left-wing groups, particularly the communists, used the term “fifth column” for political purposes in late 1939; for example, in the clandestine October 1939 copy of <i>l’Humanité</i>, the writers made up a list of so-called French fascists, including Édouard Daladier and Léon Blum. It named the Comité France- Allemagne as “the Fifth Column of capitalism and fascism.” After the 1940 defeat and armistice, some came to blame the fifth column for the fall of France, while others believed that it was invented to cover up more complex causes of defeat.

However, once Vichy embarked on a policy of collaboration with the Nazis and began implementing its National Revolution, large numbers of French avant-garde artists emigrated. <br><br>French artists were not persecuted specifically because of their modernist aesthetics, as in Nazi Germany, although much modern art, such as cubism and surrealism, was officially disallowed. French artists who were Jewish were in jeopardy due to Vichy’s anti-Semitic policies. Others were in danger because of Vichy’s agreement to “surrender on demand” any person wanted by the Third Reich, as stipulated in Article 19 of the 1940 Franco–German armistice. Also in danger were recently naturalized French citizens. <br><br>Marshal Pétain’s announcement that architecture, sculpture, and painting should now serve the needs of the new French State and that artists should save the nation from social decomposition by employing a moralizing aesthetic echoed Nazi cultural policies. Numerous French avant-gardists, horrified by such statements, feared that France, historically a land of political asylum and the cradle of modern art, would now initiate repressive measures against them because of their art. <br><br>Among the thousands of refugees trapped in France’s unoccupied area after the French defeat were the prominent French artists André Masson, whose wife was Jewish, André Breton, Marcel Duchamp, and recently naturalized French citizens Marc Chagall and Jacques Lipchitz. Rather than choosing to stay in France, all of these artists managed to emigrate. By 1944, over 2,000 scholars, artists, musicians, and actors had come to the United States, including virtually all of the French surrealists, an enormous influx of cultural expatriates that profoundly influenced the evolution of the arts in America, helping to transform New York into the postwar international art capital. <br><br>S.

Initially viewing France as a safe haven from antimodernist, anti-foreigner, and anti-Semitic Nazi policies, expatriate artists formed several organizations in Paris. Both the Kollektiv deutscher Künstler (1936) and the Freier Künstlerbund (1938) held exhibits, published accounts of the dangers of Nazi ideology and policy, and agitated for individual freedom in the arts. Members included the artists Otto Freundlich, Gert Wollheim, and Max Ernst, as well as art historians Paul Westheim, Carl Einstein, and Walter Benjamin, all Germans, along with many French sympathizers. <br><br>With the French defeat and Vichy’s decision to collaborate with Germany, hundreds of expatriate artists were subjected to internment and persecution, their French citizenship often revoked. Others hid, joined Resistance efforts, fled overseas, were deported to extermination camps, or died in France as a result of Vichy’s legislation. Artists such as Hans Reichel, Gert Wollheim, Wols (Wolfgang Schulze), Hans Belmer, and Victor Brauner, a Romanian Jew, hid in the countryside throughout the Occupation, suffering extreme deprivation. Recently widowed Sonia Delauney remained in Grâsse with a few artists until the liberation. Many, however, such as Chaim Soutine and Sylvain Itkine, did not survive the Occupation years. Otto Freundlich, Charlotte Salomon, Rudolf Lévy, Jacques Gotko, and approximately 80 other Jewish artists died in the Holocaust, most having first been sent to internment and deportation camps in France. The Alsatian Hans Arp escaped to Switzerland, and Joan Miró returned to Spain, while Max Ernst, Richard Lindner, Wilfredo Lam, and hundreds of other cultural luminaries eventually made their way to North America, Central America, or Cuba. <br><br>Labeled Judeo-Marxist decadents, Wassily Kandinsky (a French citizen since 1939) and the Spaniard Pablo Picasso were not allowed to exhibit but were never interned and continued to paint throughout the war years. Marc Chagall, a French citizen since 1937 of Russian-Jewish background, was released within hours from an internment camp once prison officials realized who he was. Neither Kandinsky nor Chagall had his French citizenship revoked. Undoubtedly, these artists’ international stature provided them with some degree of protection from the hardships faced by other expatriate artists in France. <br><br>Although France was initially one of the most important havens for cultural figures fleeing the Third Reich, it proved to be most inhospitable to expatriates after 1939.

case 361: $("div#commentary").html('<b>FINE ARTS IN OCCUPIED FRANCE</b> were summarized shortly after the liberation of Paris by American correspondents who told surprising stories. John Groth, in <i>The Art Digest </i>of 1 December 1944, noted: “In Paris, I found the studios and galleries full of new and exciting works . . . I was astounded at the great number of art publications of the last four years. Books of color reproductions of the paintings of the old masters . . . and of the modern masters— Van Gogh, Degas, Picasso.” John Pudney, writing in the <i>New Statesman and Nation</i>, 16 September 1944, found Picasso’s studio “packed with [the] four years’ work” and Picasso himself safe and voluble. France, an uncontested center of fine arts creation and display before World War II, had changed. It took more than a visit to the art galleries or an interview with Picasso, however, to recap the impact on the fine arts of four years of occupation. <br><br>“Freedom” in the fine arts had been only skin-deep during the Occupation years. The art world had been under close surveillance by Nazi censors, or “<i>referats</i>.” Germans attended openings, controlled the printing and distribution of posters that announced exhibitions, and could, at their discretion, close a show and have works removed or even destroyed by slashing. A number of galleries that belonged to Jews were “Aryanized”; no art by the expressionist Jewish painter Chaim Soutine could be shown in a gallery or museum, and any gallery showing art by Jewish artists risked being closed, and the owner arrested. At least 80 Jewish artists disappeared in the Holocaust, including Otto Freundlich, Moishe Kogan, and Max Jacob, the last better known for his free verse and discovery of Picasso than for his paintings. Soutine is said to have died of fright. Picasso had been forbidden to exhibit his work and had not been spared occasional visits from the Gestapo. <br><br>France’s artistic patrimony—the contents of its national museums and leading private collections, particularly those owned by Jews—had been jeopardized by Hitler’s and Göring’s desires for masterpieces for the mammoth museums they were planning to create in the large German-centered Europe of the future. Prior to the 1940 debacle, major works from Paris museums and other sources had been transferred southward, but the armistice lines had forced a second move and left a number of key works at the mercy of the occupying forces. French museum collections escaped major depradations thanks to the guile of curators, such as Rose Valland, but important private collections belonging to Jews disappeared as did their owners. Furthermore, a succession of officially ordered purges emptied many public squares of statues in bronze, allegedly melted down for military use. Not until the Allied troops defeated Germany did the extent of the looting become known. <br><br>Of course, the Occupation years had not been damaging to all; academic and classical sculptors avid for commissions had a hard time resisting offers from the Nazi and Vichy authorities. The veteran <i>fauve </i>painters, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck in particular, found themselves and their works in the limelight once again. Indeed, their participation with 11 of their peers in a propaganda trip to Germany in 1941 would bring accusations against them after the war. Henri Matisse, who lived in southern France, which was occupied by the Germans only in November 1942, went on working and exhibiting, as did Pierre Bonnard and Francis Picabia, who lived nearby. Matisse’s wife and daughter were arrested for Resistance activity. Picabia’s first wife, Gabrielle, also belonged to a Resistance network. All three survived. <br><br>The wartime departure for the Americas of a handful of international modernist painters left a vacuum in the Paris art world that was soon filled by French painters who, in the 1930s, had worked in their shadow. Gathered in Paris by Jean Bazaine, a leader of the pro-Vichy Jeune France organization, some 21 painters, whose styles ranged from hyperclassical to nearly abstract, held a first exhibition at the Braun Gallery in 1941 under the name Jeunes Peintres de Tradition Française (Young Painters in the French Tradition). Then the group split. Several, calling themselves the “<i>bleu-blanc-rouge subjectives</i>“ (blue, white, red subjectives), coalesced around a shared definition of French tradition harking back to medieval church muralists. They incorporated the formal and color innovations of early twentieth-century French art, but excluded the more international sources, expressionism and surrealism. The leading artists in this group were Bazaine, Maurice Estève, Alfred Manessier, Gustave Singier, Édouard Pignon, and André Fougeron. It was their paintings that the liberators of Paris first saw in the summer of 1944. <br><br>Art history has not been kind to the Bazaine group; they have not gained the international recognition that Jean Dubuffet and Jean Fautrier, partisans of a radical break with tradition and contemporaries of the former, have achieved. Fautrier, whom the anti-Semitic critic Lucien Rebatet had placed at the top of his list of degenerate artists, was one of the rare, younger painters to express sympathy for the oppressed with a series of works called <i>Hostages</i>, thick, pasty surfaces in pink and purple tones suggesting the crushed heads and bodies of victims of torture. <br><br>Overall and with very few exceptions, the suffering endured by France during four years of Occupation was not reflected by its painters and sculptors. The painters and sculptors who were allowed to show their art tended to avoid controversy by censoring themselves, and the unusual economic situation of occupied France served some of them well. <br><br>*†M.

He also sent similar telegrams to Mussolini, Chamberlain, and Daladier. After the declaration of war in September 1939, Flandin and Pierre Laval quickly became the parliamentary focus of those opposed to the conflict, though Flandin played no part in the overthrow of the Paul Reynaud cabinet on 16 June 1940. Indeed, he tried to outmaneuver Laval at Vichy, giving the most eloquent tributes of the entire conclave to the vanquished Republic, when Marshal Pétain’s dictatorship was established. <br><br>Flandin was appointed foreign minister at Vichy when Laval fell from power on 13 December 1940. As Pétain’s most important official, Flandin pursued a cautiously collaborationist policy toward the Reich until Vichy intrigues and German pressure forced the marshal to dismiss him after eight weeks in office. Flandin spent the next 20 months preparing for his move to North Africa, which took place shortly before the Allied landings in November 1942. A year later, he was arrested by General de Gaulle’s government at Algiers, accused of violating, as Pétain’s minister, Article 75 of the Penal Code, which deals with national security. <br><br>Flandin was at length acquitted by the Haute Cour de Justice in 1946, condemned to only 12 hours of national indignity. However, a vote by the chamber later that year prohibited former ministers of Pétain from running for national political office. Flandin’s fate was similar to that suffered by much of the pre-1944 Right, compromised by a pacifism and a collaboration that were anathema to a liberated France. <br><br>*J.-B.

Fontenoy joined the Communist Party, then followed Jacques Doriot into the Parti Populaire Français. He acquired some notoriety as the author of four books, never republished: <i>L’École du renégat </i>in 1936; <i>Cloud ou le Communiste à la page </i>in 1937; <i>Shanghaı¨ secret</i>, a Prix Marianne winner in 1938; and <i>Le Songe du voyageur </i>in 1939. He married Madeleine Charnaux, a well-known sculptor and aviatrix, the holder of six international flight records, in 1938. <br><br>In 1939 Fontenoy fought against Soviet forces in Finland, where he was gravely wounded. Returning to France, he became an intermediary between his friend Otto Abetz and Pierre Laval in the days immediately after the defeat of France. With Eugène Deloncle, Fontenoy helped create the collaborationist Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire in late 1940, and in early 1941 the two men participated in the founding of the Rassemblement National Populaire. Fontenoy wrote for several Paris collaborationist newspapers, including <i>Ré- volution nationale</i>, where there appeared periodic rumors of his suicide or assassination, it being known that he had been a drug user since his China days. <br><br>He joined the Légion des Volontaires Français briefly as a war correspondent in late 1941 before returning to France. At the end of 1943 Laval appointed him adjunct director of the Office Français d’Information, created in 1940 by Vichy to replace Havas. In 1943, Madeleine Charnaux died of cancer, and, in August 1944, Fontenoy fled France with the departing Germans.

An outgrowth of France-Liberté, it included members of Jeune République (Antoine Avinin), political figures from Lyons (Auguste Pinton and Noe¨l Clavier), and former communists (Elie Péju and Jean-Jacques Soudeille). These men had in common Republicanism, maturity, and a solid political education. They mobilized against Vichy and the Germans. The arrival of Jean-Pierre Lévy enabled them to publish a clandestine newspaper, <i>Le Franc-Tireur</i>, with a run of 5,000 in December 1941. Thanks to Lévy’s friendship, family, and professional networks, the movement created around the newspaper spread throughout the southern zone. In addition to Lyons and its neighboring departments, it had important antennae in the Mediterranean area, the Auvergne, and the Limousin. The journalist Georges Altman took over partial charge of publishing the newspaper when Eugène Claudius-Petit joined the group in 1942. Subsequently, noted persons, including political writer Albert Bayet and historian Marc Bloch, also joined Franc-Tireur. <br><br>The year 1942 witnessed the first contacts with Combat and Libération. Following a decisive meeting with an emissary of General de Gaulle in March 1942, Franc-Tireur solidly supported Jean Moulin in his struggles with Combat and <i>Libération</i>. Despite discussion within the group, it recognized General de Gaulle as head of the Resistance and accepted the formation of a single secret army as well as the amalgamation of the three south zone movements. On the eve of the liberation, its newspaper was printed in both zones, in runs of 150,000. Sociologically, Franc-Tireur recruited in the middle classes, among shopkeepers, schoolteachers, and professors. Politically, it was on the Left, calling for the return of the Republic, the nationalization of business, and the disappearance of capitalism. It was characterized by an opposition spirit taken from Jacobinism’s defense of the Republic and democracy. <br><br>L. Douzou and D.

Not to be confused with the socialist Franc-Tireur, its name recalls the French irregulars of the Franco–Prussian War and Soviet partisan forces. Following the German invasion of Soviet Russia in 1941, the Communist Party encouraged the beginning of armed struggle against the occupying army, sponsoring groups that included the Organisation secrète, Bataillons de la jeunesse (Youth Battalions), and Main d’oeuvre immigré (Immigrant Labor). In February 1942, these three groups were substantially merged into a new structure under the title Francs-Tireurs et partisans français. Initially composed of communists, it rapidly opened its ranks to resisters of all persuasions. During 1942, the FTP became the military wing of the political movement Front National. It also published a newspaper, <i>France d’abord </i>(France First). <br><br>Stronger in the northern zone, the FTP also operated in the south, based mainly in the larger towns and cooperating closely with clandestine trade union movements. It was organized in a pyramid, based on “triangles” of three members reporting upward to a member of the next triangle in seniority. This proved a flexible and relatively secure structure, particularly in the early stages, when most members combined clandestine activities with a “normal” life. From 1943, members increasingly became full-time underground fighters, with more attacks on German forces and against industrial and infrastructure targets, including railways, electricity cables, and telephone lines. <br><br>The FTP was vigorously led by Charles Tillon. Its leadership included Marcel Prenant, Eugène Henaff, André Ouzoulias, and Georges Vallet. The FTP’s most dashing figure, Pierre Georges, known as <i>le colonel </i>Fabien, was both the first to kill a German officer, in August 1941, and a leader of the insurrection that led to the liberation of Paris three years later. <br><br>Regarded with suspicion by Gaullists and the Allied leadership because of their communist complexion, the FTP also rejected the tactics urged on the Resistance from London, especially the <i>“attentiste” </i>approach of deferring military activity in France until the Allies had launched their offensive. FTP leaders argued that their armed actions could pave the way for the offensive and open the “second front” urged by the beleaguered Soviet Union. They also rejected attempts to shape the Resistance into a classical army, arguing that the guerrilla warfare of small, highly mobile units was more effective in tying down the German army and less prone to heavy losses. <br><br>Consequently, the FTP were rarely the recipients of materiel dropped into France from Britain and depended on weapons and ammunition seized in increasingly audacious raids on the German army, the <i>milice</i>, the police, and remnants of the Vichy armed forces. As D-Day approached, too slowly for the FTP’s taste, the organization joined with the Armée secrète of the noncommunist Mouvements Unis de la Résistance to form the Forces françaises de l’Intérieur. Coordinating their activities with the Allied campaign in the spring of 1944, the FTP won the grudging respect of the Allies and was responsible for liberating large areas outside the main Allied advance, especially in Brittany and the southwest. <br><br>Though some FTP members harbored plans to lead a revolutionary uprising on the Bolshevik model, the Communist Party, following Stalin’s directives, rejected these aspirations. FTP fighters had to choose between enrolling in the regular French army, as many did, or returning to civilian life in liberated France. <br><br>J.-P.

The dissolution of the French Communist Party (PCF) in September 1939 thrust the existing communist immigrant organization (Section de la Main d’OEuvre immigrée [MOI]) into clandestinity, where it was persecuted by the Vichy regime. Louis Gronowski, Jacques Kaminiski, and Arthur London reorganized the movement in liaison with the clandestine PCF. Its members, led by Francis Boczor, were in the original armed resistance of the PCF, the Organization spéciale, beginning in August 1940. In April 1942, when this became the FTP(F), individual groups were encouraged to become independent, and the large MOI groups became FTP-MOI. By the autumn of 1942 there were five fighting units of the FTP-MOI in Paris with units being established in Lyons, Toulouse, Marseilles, Grenoble, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Nice. In late 1942, the Paris FTPMOI suffered a round of arrests by the French police; however, by August 1943, it had 65 members, centered in two units and a special assassination squad, including the Manouchian Group. Arrested in November 1943, they were made famous by a German “red poster” denouncing the French Resistance as the “<i>armée du crime</i>“ (army of crime). The composition of the FTP-MOI was almost entirely immigrant, mainly political refugees, Jews, and veterans of the Spanish civil war.

At first de Gaulle expected prominent political and military leaders to rally to the cause. When none did, he assumed responsibility for leading the Free French. <br><br>Despite differences, Winston Churchill supported de Gaulle throughout the war. He provided access to the BBC and on 7 August 1940 agreed to support the Free French financially. At the time only 7,000 Free French were in the U.K., and de Gaulle controlled no French territory, although a series of rallies in the latter half of 1940 produced Free French control over portions of the empire from the Pacific to Equatorial Africa. An attempt to rally French West Africa failed when fighting broke out between Vichy naval forces and an Anglo- French expedition sent to Dakar in late September. Stung by Vichy accusations that the Free French were tools of British imperialism, de Gaulle decided to give the movement a political legitimacy. Following the Dakar setback de Gaulle reached Brazzaville, where he formed a Council for the Defense of the Empire to administer the rallied territories, and in November he declared that Vichy was not free to defend French interests as a result of the armistice and that it was an illegal regime. <br><br>Free French claims to legitimacy clashed with both Vichy and the attitudes and actions of Britain and the United States. De Gaulle shared Vichy’s fear that “Anglo-Saxon” powers intended to exploit French weakness to deny restoration of French control over imperial territory. After a bitter clash over Syria and Lebanon, Churchill tried to limit de Gaulle’s power within the Free French movement by encouraging the formation of a committee to oversee his actions, whereupon de Gaulle converted the French National Committee, formed in September 1941, into a nucleus for a Free French Provisional Government, supplanting the Council for Defense of the Empire as the political arm of the Free French. <br><br>American diplomatic ties with Vichy complicated Free French relations with the United States, although the United States acknowledged Free French authority in those colonies that had rallied. De Gaulle objected that this policy encouraged disunity. The issue became acute when the Allies landed in North Africa on 8 November 1942, and General Eisenhower accepted Admiral Darlan as high commissioner for North Africa in exchange for Darlan’s ordering a cease-fire. After Darlan’s assassination, Roosevelt promoted the royalist General Henri Giraud to head French forces and share power with de Gaulle. After protracted negotiations with his rival, de Gaulle reached Algiers on 30 May 1943 and agreed to cochair the French Committee of National Liberation with Giraud. In the next few weeks, de Gaulle outmaneuvered Giraud to gain sole political and military leadership of the Free French, called “Fighting French” after Bir Hakeim.<br><br>By this time all elements of the Resistance acknowledged de Gaulle as leader of Free France. De Gaulle purged Vichy elements from the colonial administration, and he established a Consultative Assembly in Algiers with representation from all political parties resisting fascism. Fearing American intentions to establish a military government (AMGOT) upon landing in Normandy, de Gaulle announced, on the eve of D-Day, the creation of political commissioners to exercise authority in the name of the Provisional Government. Although excluded from the planning for Normandy, de Gaulle’s representatives became the administrators of the liberated territory. The liberation of Paris assured Free French control as the Provisional Government of France, which was formally recognized by the Allies in October 1944. <br><br>J.-P.

The Grand Orient lodge was deemed especially culpable because of its involvement in education and, according to the 1943 propaganda film <i>Forces Occultes</i>, for helping to start the war in 1939. To eradicate Freemasonry, Vichy promulgated a law on 13 August 1940 dissolving secret societies. All French lodges were banned: the Grande Orient, Grande Loge, and the Droit humain. Freemasons had to declare publicly their membership and civil servants had to swear that they were not Masons. Few sanctions were taken against those who renounced their membership. In May 1941 fresh declarations were required, and those who had held Masonic office were forced to resign. The <i>Journal Officiel </i>in August 1941 published the names of 14,600 French officials allegedly remaining Masons. A secret society service, under the control of Bernard Fay¨, head of the Bibliothèque nationale and a scholar of Masonry’s alleged influence on the French Revolution, was set up to centralize propaganda and repression. Fay¨’s department also created a museum and library devoted to Masonic “perfidy.” The results of his investigation were published in <i>Les Documents Maçonniques </i>from October 1941 to 1942. By 1943 Marshal Pétain realized that the purge of Freemasons had been futile. While one of his first ministers of education, Émile Mireaux, in office just a few weeks in the summer of 1940, initiated sanctions against teachers who were Masons, his successor, Jérôme Carcopino, who lasted from February 1941 to April 1942, effectively ended this hunt.

A career officer, Frenay broke with his bourgeois family background when he became involved in the Resistance. After escaping from a prisoner of war camp in 1940, he spent some time as a garrison officer in Marseilles. Yet he was increasingly attracted to the notion of creating a secret army and intelligence networks. By early 1941, he had created a Resistance group, the Mouvement de Libération Nationale, producing the <i>Bulletin d’information et de propagande</i>. This clandestine publication was superseded by <i>Les petites ailes </i>(Little Wings) and <i>Vérités </i>(Truths), which, in November 1941, combined with François de Menthon’s Liberté to create the journal and Resistance movement <i>Combat</i>. Starting from an anti-German but pro-Vichy position, Frenay moved toward a more open critique of Vichy in early 1942, partly influenced by his companion and fellow resister, Bertie Albrecht. His prewar army career had given him links with Vichy, which he severed after a series of controversial meetings with Vichy interior minister Pierre Pucheu in February 1942. <br><br>An anticommunist, Frenay was generally mistrustful of all prewar political parties.

Its activities north and south were brought under one national executive committee, led by Pierre Villon, director of the northern zone after the arrest of Georges Politzer, and included the psychologist Henri Wallon, the physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, and the Carmelite Father Philippe. In the spring of 1943 Jean Moulin persuaded the movement to join his National Resistance Council (CNR), whose charter Villon played a key role in drafting. Strongly supported by the PCF, Front National (FN) members were prominent in local and departmental Resistance committees throughout France.

An aide to General Joseph Joffre in 1914, he is said to have devised the plan for the “Miracle at the Marne.” Experience of that critical battle, however, left him with a lifelong fear of not being able to hold the Germans again. He rose quickly in the interwar army, aided by political contacts, especially ties with two politicians of the Right, André Tardieu and Pierre Laval. Unabrasive, he reassured his political mentors by telling them what he sensed they wanted to hear. <br><br>Gamelin inherited from the Pétain-dominated General Staff of the 1920s the doctrine of a continuous front composed of fortifications and France’s Belgian ally, which he adapted in an attempt to modernize the lessons of the last war. His own strategy relied on allies to transport the conflict away from French soil. From January 1933, he saw as given an imminent German reoccupation of the Rhineland, to presage Hitler’s movement to the east. By 1935 he made plain to his government his preference for a war in the east in which Italy would serve as a bridge for a French expeditionary force to a Central European front. With the Rhineland reoccupation in March 1936, he insisted on the need to solder the French and Belgian frontiers, so that the French army could move into Belgium in the event of German aggression in Central Europe. By late 1936, he redefined his strategic reserve: from an uncommitted force to be called to any front as needed, it became a specialized, mobile force to be committed to the neutral Low Countries from the first hours of a conflict. The continuous front doctrine was thus extended into Holland in a maneuver later called the Breda Variant. <br><br>Mussolini’s defection to Hitler’s camp after 1936 and the onslaught of international crises in 1938–1939, which brought German ascendancy over Austria and Czechoslovakia and finally over Poland, reduced Gamelin’s strategic options from the unencumbered eastern terrain to the narrow confines of Belgium. After Poland’s fall in September 1939, he convinced the British to accept his plan for a mechanized advance far into the Low Countries, to Breda in southern Holland. On 10–15 May 1940, as German tanks broke through the Ardennes in the south into France, he squandered his strategic reserve in a futile dash to Breda (10–12 May). <br><br>On 16 May, Gamelin, who had disdained radio contact with the front, conceded defeat to the French and British prime ministers. He insisted that the battle was lost because he had no further reserves. Paul Reynaud grasped that once the French front was broken, there could be no repetition of the Marne miracle. The collapse in 1940 stemmed not, as Gamelin later alleged, from inferior French troops but from the doctrine of continuous fronts, which precluded regrouping for in-depth defense on French soil with an adequate strategic reserve. By Gamelin’s dismissal on 19 May, the bulk of France’s military accepted that defeat had been sealed: “Henceforth, all decisions were taken in an atmosphere of pre-armistice” (F. Delpla). Demanded not by Gamelin, but by his successor— although there was no change in strategic response with Maxime Weygand’s 11th-hour reappearance—the timing of the armistice served the purposes for which Gamelin’s strategy had been devised. The armistice ensured that there would be no prolonged conflict on French soil and no repetition of the national bloodletting of 1914–1918. By continually attempting to fight the war elsewhere, Gamelin in effect made it impossible to fight at all. <br><br>*M. Bloch, <i>Strange Defeat: A Statement of Evidence Written in 1940</i>, trans.

May– June 1940: Hitler’s armies defeated the French and British, invaded France, and took Paris. The elderly Marshal Philippe Pétain asked for an armistice. On 18 June, speaking on London radio, de Gaulle appealed to the French to join him and continue the fight. Nothing, he said, was lost. France still had an empire, it was still allied to Britain, and it could count on the vast industrial potential of the United States.<br><br>Born 22 November 1890, a graduate of the Saint-Cyr military academy and subsequently becoming an officer, de Gaulle was wounded, gassed, and taken prisoner during the First World War. Four times he tried to escape. Repatriated in 1918, he became a military instructor, wrote <i>La discorde chez l’ennemi</i>, and criticized the military command’s influence on the civilian authorities. After two years’ service in the Middle East, he entered the Defense Ministry. His books, <i>Le fil de l’épée </i>(1932) and <i>Vers l’armée de métier </i>(1934), recommended a professional army of armored divisions with full offensive capabilities. France’s military command and, with the exception of Paul Reynaud, its political leaders rejected his suggestions. <br><br>On 10 May 1940 armored German forces invaded France. Commanding a tank division, de Gaulle was named to the Reynaud government. Discouraged by the deteriorating military situation, however, Reynaud gave way to Pétain, who was surrounded by politicians, such as Laval, who favored accommodation with Hitler. Despite harsh terms, an armistice was signed on 22 June. Having participated in Franco–British talks aimed at continuing the war, de Gaulle arrived in London, where, with Churchill’s agreement, he broadcast over the BBC, telling the French to continue the struggle against Germany. In Vichy, Pétain ordered him to return, but de Gaulle refused. De Gaulle faced many obstacles: Vichy sentenced him to death, he tried unsuccessfully to rally the French outpost at Dakar, Franco–British rivalry hampered him in the Middle East, and Roosevelt mistrusted this self-assured officer and created many problems for him. However, several colonies, at first in Equatorial Africa and the Pacific, rallied to him. From Chad, General Philippe Leclerc was able to attack Italian Libya. After 1942 Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia supplied forces that eventually fought in Italy. In 1944 the Leclerc Division liberated Paris and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny’s army, having landed in Provence, reached Alsace.<br><br>De Gaulle struggled tenaciously for the liberation, unity, and independence of France. Free France announced that it would reestablish Republican laws and overturn the racial edicts of Vichy, which it later did. Thanks to Jean Moulin, the home Resistance’s networks and <i>maquis </i>recognized General de Gaulle’s authority. With the liberation, the French gave an enthusiastic welcome to de Gaulle, first in the provinces, then, despite several unsuccessful sabotage attempts, in the 26 August 1944 parade down the Champs Élysées in Paris. <br><br>The war, however, was not yet over. German counteroffensives in late 1944 were repulsed by the Allies, led by General Dwight Eisenhower. De Lattre de Tassigny advanced toward the Rhine at Strasbourg, and Leclerc toward the Danube. With the German surrender in May 1945, what had been announced on 18 June 1940 had been achieved. Unable to get the political parties to adopt his view of an efficient Republican government, however, de Gaulle withdrew from the government in January 1946. Twelve years later, the Algerian war recalled him to power. He then established the Fifth Republic, which he led until 1969. General de Gaulle died in retirement in his home at Columbey-les-deux-Eglises on 9 November 1970. <br><br>*†C. de Gaulle, <i>Discours et Messages</i>, 5 vols.

From 7,200 in 1939, their number had risen to 50,000 by mid-1941. The <i>gazogène </i>engine had a large, tanklike generator where the fuel was burned to produce gas. The gas was then cooled, filtered, and mixed with air before going to the motor. <i>Gazogène </i>engines were mounted on the roofs of buses, behind the cabs of trucks, and in the trunks or on the running boards of cars. <br><br><i>Gazogène </i>engines had many drawbacks. They were bulky, cumbersome, and hard to start. They required extensive maintenance, much of it on a daily basis. Ashes had to be removed from the generator, filters had to be cleaned, and the frequent leaks at joints in the machinery had to be watched for and immediately repaired. Because of these maintenance difficulties <i>gazogène </i>engines were more practical for trucks, buses, boats, and industrial tractors handled by professional drivers and mechanics than for private automobiles. When the war ended, and gasoline again became available, <i>gazogènes </i>disappeared from circulation. <br><br>D.

Combatready troops, stationed mainly along the coasts under the western command (Oberbefehlshaber West), were normally not available for duties related to the occupation.

The elimination of Franco–British power was seen as a prerequisite to the racial reordering of the East, and Hitler preferred to fight the Western democracies while Germany still held an advantage in arms and conscripts. The joint German–French declaration of 6 December 1938, which recognized mutual frontiers, was a German ploy to lull France into slower rearmament efforts. Yet Poland’s refusal to submit to German tutelage by joining the Anti-Comintern Pact meant that Germany would attack Poland in 1939 and France and Britain thereafter. Hitler hoped the Western democracies would abandon Poland or at least delay any response. The Nazi–Soviet nonaggression pact (23 August 1939) and Germany’s proclamation of its peaceful intentions toward Britain and France were designed to create such a pause, but if the Western democracies were to honor their treaty commitments to Poland, then Germany would fight them too. After attacking Poland on 1 September 1939, Hitler ignored the Anglo–French ultimatum that called for withdrawal; thus, he triggered British and French declarations of war on 3 September. <br><br>Following Poland’s swift destruction, Germany sent peace feelers to London and Paris, hoping to delay a war in the West until conditions were more opportune. Germany argued that the object of the ultimatum—Poland—now ceased to exist. Since the governments of Neville Chamberlain and Édouard Daladier refused to consider peace until the Germans had evacuated Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the Germans simultaneously prepared a western offensive. Hitler’s hope to attack in November 1939 was delayed by logistics, but following the occupation of Denmark and Norway in April 1940, German ground forces attacked the Low Countries and France in May. The offensive through the Ardennes and drive toward the Atlantic divided, disoriented, and demoralized the French forces, while the British evacuated the continent at the end of the month. Convinced that France had lost the war and that national renewal under strong leadership was necessary, Marshal Pétain’s government asked for armistice terms on 17 June. <br><br>Due to Hitler’s hope for a French government able to maintain stability and end resistance in the metropole and in the empire, the Germans infused a certain restraint into the German–French Armistice Treaty, signed 22 June 1940. Three-fifths of France would be occupied for the continuation of the war against Britain; the French would bear all occupation costs; French armed forces would demobilize to prescribed limits; prisoners would remain in captivity for the war’s duration; and air, sea, and radio traffic would need prior German approval. Yet France’s still-intact fleet would remain under French command, and no territorial changes or occupation of imperial possessions was mentioned. Germany pressed the Italian government—which had declared war on 10 June in expectation of territorial rewards—into similar restraint in its own armistice with France (24 June 1940). In the final peace settlement, French military power would vanish, and Germany and Italy would take parts of France and its empire. After British raids at Mers-el-Kébir (3 July 1940) and Dakar (23–25 September 1940) and General de Gaulle’s coup in French Equatorial Africa (26– 30 August 1940), the French government attempted to collaborate actively in Germany’s war effort in return for a relaxation of armistice terms and assurances regarding France’s future. Meetings between Hitler, Pétain, and Vice Premier Pierre Laval at Montoire (22 and 24 October 1940) brought a French pledge to fight the British and Gaullists in French Africa, and Germany allowed the French to delay colonial disarmament while approving the deployment of modest colonial forces for this purpose (July–December 1940). Yet to Hitler, collaboration meant accelerated German exploitation of France. Germany demanded air bases in Casablanca (15 July 1940), hinting at a forward Mediterranean strategy that they never consistently pursued (See Spain). They also carried out mass expulsions from Alsace-Lorraine (November–December 1940), insisted that French industries produce for the German war effort (2 September 1940), remained silent when the Japanese occupied Indochina (22 September 1940), and assumed control of French mineral interests in Yugoslavia (November 1940). The Germans also avoided promises concerning the French government’s return to Paris, the relaxation of the Demarcation Line, which separated France’s occupied and unoccupied zones, the reduction of exorbitant occupation costs, the future status of the departments Nord and Pas-de-Calais, and France’s imperial future. To Hitler, Germany had been generous enough when it allowed the reinterment of the duke of Reichstadt (Napoleon’s son) in the Invalides (15 December 1940). <br><br>Pétain’s 13 December 1940 dismissal of Laval, whom Hitler had viewed as the motor behind French collaboration, brought angry reaction. France, Hitler felt, had reverted to its traditional hatred of Germany. Any possibility of meaningful German concessions thus vanished amid steeper demands, even after Laval’s return as premier in April 1942. French food delivery quotas for Germany were sharply increased in June 1942, and the conscription of French labor for work in Germany began in September. Germany, meanwhile, rejected French requests to augment their North African forces and to have a defense sector on the French Atlantic coast to repulse Allied attacks. The Allied invasion of North Africa (8 November 1942) brought swift reaction by German forces instead, which landed in Tunisia (9 November) and swept into France’s unoccupied zone (11 November). Vichy’s policy of firing on Allied troops but not German ones brought no reward from Berlin, which viewed the armistice between Admiral Darlan and the Americans (11 November) and the scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon (28 November) as confirmation of French treachery. Hitler ordered the 100,000-man French army allowed under the armistice dissolved on 27 November. <br><br>Germany also expected French cooperation in the elimination of Europe’s Jews. Despite Vichy’s desire to end Jewish influence in French national life, the Germans were irritated at what they perceived as official obstruction to their policy of mass murder. In the occupied zone, German authorities began using the French bureaucracy in September 1940 for the registration of Jews, “Aryanization” of Jewish property, and deportation to Auschwitz, which began in March 1942. German deportation quotas, which included the unoccupied zone, began in June 1942. Laval’s attempt to surrender only foreign Jews in return for political concessions brought only complaints of French circumvention, and Germany’s takeover of the unoccupied zone in November 1942 and of Italy’s small occupation zone in July 1943 brought all Jews in France directly under German control anyway. Of the 330,000 Jews in France in 1940, 76,000 were deported to Poland, and 30 percent of these were French citizens. The remainder of France’s Jews were saved not by Vichy but by the Allied liberation. Despite the steady erosion of whatever sovereignty the Vichy regime had once possessed, Germany depended on Pétain’s prestige until the end of the Occupation. Concerns in August 1943 regarding an Allied invasion attempt brought German demands that the Pétain government maintain order in France should a landing materialize. The Allied attack of June 1944, the liberation of France, and the stream of Frenchmen joining a vengeful Resistance showed that the Germans, through their policies, had eroded Pétain’s prestige beyond repair. As a final gesture of futility, the Germans in August 1944 attempted to create a “government-in-exile” under Pétain, whom they removed to the Hohenzollern castle of Sigmaringen in southwestern Germany. <br><br>*†H.

Its four regional Propaganda Staffeln covered the occupied zone, and five national groups controlled the press, literature, radio, culture, and “active propaganda.” Its officials were in liaison, but not without occasional friction, with German ambassador Otto Abetz, who from 1942 secured responsibility for cultural exchanges. <br><br>Control often extended to ownership, and the Pressegruppe, which allocated all newsprint, also took over several publications, including <i>Paris-soir</i>.

Films, radio, even television programs, and an active press were produced for German occupying forces. Some of this was translated for French consumption, including the glossy magazine <i>Signal</i>. Wall posters, regularly issued, called for cooperation or condemned national or racial enemies but were vulnerable to defacement. Successful cultural initiatives included the Arno Breker sculpture exhibition of 1942 and the lectures and published <i>Cahiers </i>of the Institut allemand, which also organized well attended German-language classes. <br><br>While high-profile cultural events attracted the Parisian elite, probably the most powerful propaganda was indirect, through detailed censorship, control of news and information, and the willing services of collaborationist French writers and broadcasters, all carefully managed and monitored by the Abteilung. <br><br>J.-P.

Its leader, Henri Chamberlin, a prewar petty criminal with numerous arrests and convictions, was recruited by the German counterintelligence Abwehr during the early days of the Occupation. He changed his name to Lafont and was allowed by the Germans to pick his staff among criminals in the Fresnes prison. Chamberlin-Lafont and his men became “purchasing agents” for the Bureau Otto and quickly demonstrated their abilities to the Germans, who suggested they expand their activities to include tracking and arresting individuals and infiltrating Resistance groups. In 1941, now under direct Gestapo control and thus immune from his enemies in the French police, Chamberlin-Lafont moved to 93 rue Lauriston, an address that became synonymous with arbitrary detention and torture and struck terror into the hearts of people throughout France. Chamberlin- Lafont enjoyed watching the torture of suspects and often participated in beatings himself, especially if the suspect was Jewish. A large number of Resistance groups was infiltrated by these Gestapists. <br><br>Chamberlin-Lafont was well known in Parisian high society and, after being introduced to Pierre Laval by Jean Luchaire, boasted of a close personal friendship with the head of government. In the final days of the German occupation, the French Gestapo went on a killing rampage and organized the deportation of more than 400 Jews and Resistance members. Arrested after the liberation, Chamberlin-Lafont was tried and executed on 26 December 1944.

After merging his organization with de Gaulle’s to form the Comité français de libération nationale (CFLN) in mid-1943, Giraud was quickly marginalized by de Gaulle, his more politically adept co-president. Before World War II, Giraud had built a successful military career on the basis of a dashing appearance and daring style. He commanded the Seventh Army in 1940 and was taken prisoner. After escaping from Königstein prison in 1942, Giraud found that his brand of politically conservative, anti-Axis patriotism appealed to those in France who had initially supported the Vichy regime and remained sympathetic to Marshal Pétain but were becoming uneasy about the extent of collaboration with Germany and aware that the military tide had turned in favor of the Allies. The Americans, meanwhile, hoped to capitalize on Giraud’s influence in French North Africa to ease their invasion there (November 1942). In fact, Giraud arrived from France too late to be of much help during the invasion, and the American commanders turned instead to the ex- Vichy prime minister Admiral Darlan. However, when Darlan was assassinated in December 1942, Giraud became civil and military commander in chief. This was the high point of his power. Over the next six months, in spite of American backing, he was forced to give ground repeatedly in his negotiations with the Gaullists. Soon after the formation of the CFLN he was elbowed aside by General de Gaulle. In November 1943 Giraud lost his seat on the CFLN, and the following April he retired from the army.

However, the criticisms of small-business men in the GIMMCP were always more restrained than those of their colleagues in other organizations.

The major grouping, set up by Groussard at Vichy, was the CIÉ; one branch fulfilled a civilian intelligence role, while the GP were uniformed paramilitaries. This amounted essentially to a continuation of cagoulard activities, since Groussard appointed Commander Robert Labat (head of the military Cagoule in Marseilles) as his adjutant, Martin as chief organizer and recruitment officer, and Méténier as head of operations.

At the behest of Marshal Louis Franchet d’Esperey he also developed contacts with the Cagoule, though he denied ever joining that group. In 1938 and 1939 Colonel Groussard commanded Saint-Cyr.

He also established the Centre d’Information et d’Études (CIÉ), a supplemental police service. For the newly created Groupes de Protection (GP), Pétain’s praetorian guard, Groussard chose ex-<i>Cagoulard </i>François Mé- ténier, who recruited his men from the prewar “national parties.” On 13 December 1940, Groussard participated in the palace coup against Pierre Laval; subsequently, he lost his post, and the CIÉand GP were dissolved. Supported by General Charles-Léon Huntziger, Vichy’s minister of war, Groussard met in London in June 1941 with British leaders, including Churchill, the American ambassador, and representatives of General de Gaulle. Groussard sought links between Vichy and Britain and, he later asserted, with the Free French. Admiral Darlan, however, arrested him on 15 July. Imprisoned, then placed under house arrest, Groussard escaped to Switzerland when the Germans occupied southern France in November 1942.

Roma were among the groups the Nazis deemed genetically inferior and targeted for deportation to the labor and death camps of Eastern Europe. In December 1940, the Germans expelled all Roma from Alsace-Lorraine and sent them elsewhere in France, where Vichy authorities interned them. <br><br>With German endorsement, most of the French camps created for Roma were in the occupied zone. The most famous of these were Montreuil-Bellay (Maine et Loire) and Coudrecieux (Sarthe). In 1942 Vichy opened a camp for Roma at Saliers (Bouches-du-Rhône), adjacent to the Roma traditional gathering place at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in the Camargue. Romany families confined to these centers occupied their own wagons or makeshift buildings, where chronic shortages of food, clothing, heat, and clean water led to health problems and occasional epidemics. Specific death tolls for Roma in the camps are difficult to discern, as many vagrants, often in poor health before their incarceration, were probably among the fatalities. It is also hard to ascertain global figures for Roma interned in France during the war. Estimates vary from 3,000 to 30,000, though the actual number is probably closer to the smaller figure. <br><br>Although Nazi racial policies targeted Roma for extermination, only one convoy went east from Belgium, in January 1944, including 351 Roma, most of whom had been arrested in France.

France, as traditional rival for primacy in Europe and a potential ally of Russia, was the greatest obstacle to the development of Hitler’s vision. Once in power, Hitler demonstratively renounced claims to Alsace and Lorraine but also demanded international equality for the Reich. He lost all respect for the French when they failed to respond to his occupation of the Rhineland in March 1936; his contempt was confirmed by the Munich conference, the “Phoney War,” and the French military collapse of 1940. Pierre Laval, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and Otto Abetz sought vainly to persuade him of the utility of collaboration, but Hitler saw the 1940 armistice and his 24 October 1940 Montoire meeting with Marshal Pétain solely in strategic terms. Although his granting of the 1940 armistice may have doomed him in a two-front war, for Hitler, Vichy’s willingness to collaborate appeared to free up troops for the coming war in the east. French colonies and the fleet were removed from British clutches after 1940; French manpower and material resources were available for German arms production. When, after the Allied landings in North Africa, the rear and flank for the war against the USSR were no longer protected, Hitler on 11 November 1942 ordered the occupation of the southern zone and forced the construction of the “Atlantic Wall.” France would become the decisive theater where a repulsed Allied landing would shatter the alliance of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. <br><br>Hitler never wavered from his mistrust for France.

When, after France’s 1940 defeat, Japanese forces displaced the French in Indochina, Ho saw an opportunity. He declared his nation’s independence shortly after the Japanese surrendered, but his dream was delayed by years of negotiations and war, first with France, then with the United States. Son of a patriotic Confucian teacher, Ho was born as Nguyen Sinh Cung in north-central Vietnam. The young Ho worked his way by ship to London and Paris, where, as Ai Quoc (the Patriot), he wrote anticolonial articles for socialist papers and helped found the French Communist Party. A true internationalist activist, after a period of training in Moscow, he traveled to Canton and struggled for both the Chinese and Vietnamese revolutions. His writings, knowledge, and perseverance gained him many devoted followers among his compatriots, and under the name Ho Chi Minh he founded the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1925, which became the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) in 1930. After arrests, imprisonments, and a 30-year exile, Ho returned to Vietnam in 1941, where he founded the Vietminh (League for the Independence of Vietnam) to resist both Vichy and Japan. In this he gained some support from the Western allies. <br><br>When Japan surrendered, Ho established a Provisional Government and declared independence for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, hoping in vain that the Allies would honor the change. Instead, British and Chinese troops arrived and restored the country to France. Believing that France’s new leaders, including some of his old friends, would be conciliatory, Ho tried negotiation, to little avail.

Persecution began almost immediately, both in the German-occupied zone and in what was left under French control. Regular deportations of Jews, however, began only in the summer of 1942. In all, over 75,000 were dispatched to killing centers in Poland, most of whom were murdered in gas chambers. In addition, over 3,000 died in French camps or were shot in France during the course of the war. Of all these, close to one-third were French citizens. <br><br>The unusual context of the Holocaust in France is the considerable degree of autonomy accorded the French during the Nazi occupation. In this respect France differed substantially from fully occupied countries like Belgium, Holland, and Denmark or puppet states like Norway. After the war defenders of Vichy claimed that the work of this government limited the damage, preventing even higher numbers of Jewish deportations from France. However, close examination of the German documentation and research on the role of Vichy and its agencies underscore the importance of the help accorded by the collaborationist regime. <br><br>The deportations of 1942–1944 were, in fact, the culmination of two years of aggressive legislation and persecution, including laws that defined the Jews, isolated them in French society, took away their livelihood, interned many, and registered them with the police. Beginning in 1940, the Vichy government moved against the Jews on its own and in March 1941 established a central agency to coordinate anti-Jewish legislation and activity, the General Office for Jewish Affairs (Comissariat Général aux Questions Juives, or GGQJ). The government considered it extremely important that its anti-Semitic laws apply throughout the entire country, in the occupied as well as the unoccupied zones. Vichy’s leadership assumed that the Germans would be grateful to the French for pursuing their own anti-Jewish policy and would respond by yielding greater control over this and other spheres of national policy. In addition, the French were most anxious to see that the property confiscated from the Jews would not fall into the hands of the Germans. Vichy inaugurated an extensive program of “Aryanization” in July 1941, with the important objective of maintaining formerly Jewish property in France. Thereby, the occupation authorities relieved themselves of much of the trouble of persecution while drawing the French into areas where even some Vichyites showed signs of discomfort. In January 1942 the Nazis began to prepare for deportations of Jews from France and other Western European countries. Through negotiations the Nazis did their best to ensure the cooperation of the French government and administration. The spring and summer of 1942 were the turning point. In May, Pierre Laval replaced the legalistic and anti-German Xavier Vallat at the head of the CGQJ with the racist collaborator Louis Darquier de Pellepoix. Simultaneously, the Wehrmacht yielded authority over repressive activity in France to the SS. The French police under René Bousquet worked out an arrangement with the SS by which the former were given an important degree of autonomy, in exchange for agreeing to work against the enemies of the Reich. In their own zone the Germans cleared the way for deportations by imposing the wearing of a yellow star on all Jews (7 June), rounding up large numbers, and controlling the movements of the rest. <br><br>Pierre Laval and the French cabinet agreed to help with the first round of deportations. Throughout the summer and autumn, roundups of Jews occurred in both the occupied and unoccupied zones, with most of the work done by the French police. In all, 42,500 Jews were sent eastward in 1942, about one-third of them from the unoccupied zone. The deportations of the summer and autumn of 1942 stirred the first opposition to Vichy in certain segments of French opinion. A split developed in the Catholic Church, hitherto solidly behind Pétain and the “National Revolution.” Difficulties arose as the deportations gradually included French Jews as well as outsiders. As early as February 1943, when massive deportations from both zones resumed, the Germans reported that the French police were no longer as reliable as they once had been in assembling and dispatching the Jews. Even Laval dragged his feet, refusing in August 1943 to agree to strip French Jews of their citizenship so as to facilitate their deportation. Despite occasional protests and difficulties, however, the deportations continued, the last convoys leaving France in the summer of 1944. To the end, Vichy enforced the extensive apparatus of anti-Jewish laws that legitimated the deportations in the eyes of some and certainly facilitated the process of deportation. It is true that the final toll—about one-fourth of the Jews killed—seems less, proportionately, than in many other countries. But there is no evidence that Vichy authorities attempted in a concerted way to limit deportations. Popular opposition grew during the course of deportations, but by then the powerful anti-Jewish machinery had been in place and had been functioning for some time. Recent research rejects the theory of a consciously plotted strategy to save as many Jews as possible. <br><br>Centre de Documentation juive contemporaine, <i>La France et la question juive 1940/ 1944: la politique de Vichy, l’attitude des Églises et des mouvements de Résistance </i>(Paris, 1981); A.

Prostitutes were pardoned most readily, as they were said to have only followed their “profession.” For women who had relations with only one German, encountered by chance, love was invoked as an excuse. More serious in the scale of condemnation were the cases of those who in groups had socialized with the Germans or had publicly consorted with them or whose relations with them had been of a professional or commercial nature. Worst were the women collaborators whose relations with the Germans had been only the extension of pro-Nazi sentiments. <br><br>In reality, horizontal collaboration had little effect on the course of the war. With the liberation, however, the purge of horizontal collaborators assumed considerable importance. Those who had “slept with the <i>Boches</i>“ (a term of insult for Germans) were suspected of having given away secrets during their lovemaking. They were reproached for having lived in high style while the majority of the population had suffered from restrictions of all kinds. Special condemnation was reserved for those seen as oversexed, such as prisoners of war wives who had committed adultery with Germans, an act regarded as treason against the nation as well as against their husbands. Horizontal collaborators were thereby targeted for special punishment, the shaving of their heads. This ostentatious violence against them was intended to exclude these women from the community by marking their bodies but at the same time to reappropriate these bodies “defiled by the enemy” in an attempt to erase the memory of the humiliation of the Occupation. Practiced virtually throughout France, head shaving, turned horizontal collaboration into a pronounced symbol of the period. Like the GIs (American soldiers) and the FFIs (French Forces of the Interior, the military Resistance), the “<i>tondue</i>“ (shaven woman) has become one of the enduring images of the liberation. <br><br>A.

Half Alsatian, half Breton, Huntziger was graduated from the St. Cyr military academy in the class of 1901. He saw colonial service before and after World War I and received the Croix de Guerre in 1916. France’s youngest general in 1939, Huntziger was considered the most brilliant man in the Senior Command, likely to succeed Maurice-Gustave Gamelin as supreme commander. Huntziger’s Second Army suffered a decisive blow at Sedan in mid-May 1940. He parceled his armored divisions into small “packets,” which rendered his tanks incapable of withstanding Germany’s attack or mounting a counteroffensive. Still, de Gaulle pressed Premier Paul Reynaud in early June to replace General Maxime Weygand with Huntziger as supreme commander. Huntziger considered the Armistice Army, reduced to 100,000, an educational and propaganda tool. His foreign policy inconsistencies reflected violent anti-German feeling, mistrust of Britain, and pro-Pétain sentiments. After Mers-el-Kébir, Huntziger implied that France was ready to join the war against Britain, saying to German General Gerd von Rundstedt, that “the English must be expelled.” He tried to negotiate broad Franco-German collaboration but by late 1940 retreated from joint operations with Germany against British Africa. After Laval’s dismissal, 13 December 1940, Huntziger, Pierre-Étienne Flandin, and Admiral Jean-François Darlan ruled France as a triumvirate. In June–July 1941, Huntziger secretly supported General Georges Groussard’s last attempt at rapprochement with Britain, even as fighting over Syria erupted.

Against what they saw as the overbearing heaviness of existential aesthetics and the hypocrisy of a <i>résistantialisme </i>that failed to credit “sincere” collaborators with high-minded intentions, the Hussards argued for a more lighthearted, ironic, libertine, sometimes insolent, aesthetics and a relativity of moral judgment that equated wartime collaboration and resistance. <br><br>Because the Hussards did not form a closed movement, various names are occasionally mentioned as members, but the major figures were Roger Nimier, Antoine Blondin, Michel Déon, and Jacques Laurent, all young writers, alienated in late 1944 by the political atmosphere of liberated France, who clustered together with the <i>Cahiers de la Table ronde</i>. As a name, “Hussard” appears to have come from the title of Nimier’s 1950 novel, <i>Le Hussard bleu</i>, but it also reflected the elegance and bravado of hussars, the light cavalry. The young Hussards were influenced by a cluster of older writers sympathetic to the Right, including André Fraigneau, Jacques Chardonne, Paul Morand, Marcel Aymé, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, and Robert Brasillach, the last two paying with their lives for collaboration with Nazi Germany. <br><br>The significance of the Hussards lies in their having been a link in the history of the French Right, from the “nonconformists” of the 1930s, through the defenders of French Algeria in the late 1950s and early 1960s, down to the National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 1980s and 1990s.

Their attitude of “business as usual” in the face of German occupation was based on the premise that safeguarding France’s economic structure justified collaborating with the Germans, an outlook followed unswervingly by Jean Bichelonne (1904–1945), the brilliant <i>ex-Polytechnicien </i>who was appointed secretary-general for commerce and industry (July 1940–April 1942) and minister for industrial production from November 1942 onward. By the end of 1941, 7,000 French businesses were fulfilling orders for the Germans, and by 1944 this figure had doubled, meaning that the great majority of large-scale French businesses worked directly or indirectly for the German war effort. <br><br>Large-scale industrialists found their interests most effectively promoted by the Comités d’organisation (CO), founded by a number of technocratic administrators who, with Bichelonne, remained active in government circles: Jacques Barnaud, François Lehideux, Pierre Pucheu, and Gabriel Leroy- Ladurie. Designed to coordinate production under war conditions, allocate scarce resources, and protect their own sectoral interests, the CO were largely <i>dirigiste</i>, limiting some companies’ room for maneuver because committee chairmen were chosen from the biggest concern in a given branch. Lehideux, director of Renault, headed the Automobile Committee, while Auguste Detoeuf, a director of Alsthom, led the Electrical Energy Committee. Initially, the CO appeared to fulfill the corporatist ambitions of the National Revolution, yet even in Pétain’s entourage their development toward domination by the “trusts” drew sharp criticism, and some saw a “synarchist” conspiracy aimed at controlling the French economy.<br><br>For all this, French industrialists became ever more enmeshed in Germanimposed demands, particularly after the beginning of the Relève in 1942. Whereas most industrialists reluctantly accepted German orders to compensate for the contraction of business due to limited export markets, all the while keeping an eye on the possibility of a future German victory, a minority of others entered more enthusiastically into negotiations with their German counterparts. Louis Renault decided to maximize production, producing tanks directly for the German war effort during 1943 despite his factories’ being the target of Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers. Others entered into partnerships with German companies. The great Paris stores (Printemps, Samaritaine, and les Nouvelles Galeries) struck deals with their German opposite numbers (Karstadt, Erwege, and Hertie). With varying degrees of success French chemical firms negotiated with the German giant IG Farben. Whereas René Duchemin, director of Kuhlmann, came under pressure from Pucheu to accede to German demands, Rhône- Poulenc, located in the unoccupied zone, was in a better position to resist. Raoul de Vitry, too, head of Pechiney, the French aluminum manufacturer, objected to delivering to the occupiers an increasing proportion of its production when the French market could absorb it. Eventually, however, under Vichy pressure, Pechiney was forced to comply. <br><br>As the war went on, the French economy was increasingly exploited by the Germans, and those industrialists who shared Pierre Laval’s desire to find a place in the Nazi New Order followed the collaborationist logic. Bichelonne, the architect of so much Vichy policy, embodied in the Speer-Bichelonne, Accords of September 1943, remained a convinced proponent of Franco–German collaboration until his death in Germany in 1945. <br><br>*A.

In the face of falling production and the severe terms imposed by the Germans, the ministry undertook to allocate resources and regulate production and prices, as well as to safeguard French producers against inroads by German business. Its main instruments for these purposes were the Office Central de Repartition des Produits Industriels (OCRPI) and the Comités d’organisation (CO), organized on a sectoral basis following legislation of 16 August 1940. <br><br>Amid the general backlash against collaborationism and <i>étatisme </i>at the time of the liberation, the Provisional Government was at first able to maintain this component of Vichy’s administration as a weapon against the continuing problems of shortages and inflation.

Both zones in both periods witnessed a merciless Nazi exploitation of France. France, far more than occupied Russia, served Germany as a resource for economic exploitation. Within weeks of the armistice, Caudron-Renault requested permission from the Ministry of Aviation to manufacture airplanes to serve as Luftwaffe trainers. After talks in Wiesbaden and Paris (November 1940–November 1941), French dye manufacturers relinquished 51 percent control over their industry to I. G. Farben. By the end of 1941, some 59,000 French had volunteered to work in German factories. Parisian shopkeepers welcomed German soldiers. An exchange rate fixed in Berlin at 20 francs to the mark enabled soldiers to buy out stocks, providing the Reich with floods of consumer goods. Vichy protested that an occupation levy decreed in the armistice terms could maintain 18 million troops, but the Germans refused to compromise. Capital thus acquired funded German industrialists who bought French plants in France and French assets in the Balkans. German losses at Stalingrad in late 1942 and early 1943 and in Tunisia by May 1943 mandated a total war effort. The Reich now demanded economic <i>Gleichschaltung </i>(coordination) in France. By autumn 1943, virtually 50 percent of French production was earmarked for Germany. The critical issue in Franco– German relations was now French workers in Germany’s service. In France, the Reich’s plenipotentiary for the deployment of labor, Fritz Sauckel, offered to release any French prisoner of war (POW) who agreed to work in a German factory. He also offered to release one POW for every three French civilians laboring in the Reich. Sauckel argued that while Germany fought to save Europe from Bolshevism, the least Vichy could supply was laborers. Pierre Laval reluctantly agreed to impose death sentences on French officials who blocked recruitment. <br><br>Recruitment, however, did not reach desired levels, and Laval instituted a forced labor program, the Service du Travail Obligatoire, which drove many of the young French into the <i>maquis</i>. Trying another approach, Reich minister of war production Albert Speer struck a deal with Vichy’s minister of Industrial Production Jean Bichelonne, whereby French workers could remain in France if employed in designated plants, known as S-Betriebe, that were working for the German war effort. Speer would later claim victory over Sauckel, but neither side prevailed entirely. During the course of the occupation, some 798,000 French worked for Germany in France, and 875,952 French worked for Germany in Germany. <br><br>One estimate of the occupation cost for France was in excess of 154 billion francs (1938), including payments for services.

Its current director is Henry Rousso. The library of the IHTP contains more than 20,000 volumes, as well as extensive archives, periodicals, maps, microfilms, and audiotapes. Its collections concerning the Resistance and deportation are especially noteworthy. Since its inception, the IHTP has aimed to acquire every work concerning World War II published in France as well as principal foreign works on the subject. The research mission of the IHTP is carried out by a team of 20 specialists, who work collaboratively on pertinent projects. In addition, they publish the <i>Bulletin de l’IHTP</i>, organize conferences, conduct interviews, and work in cooperation with major French universities in fostering a deeper, scholarly understanding of World War II and contemporary Europe. <br><br>M.-T.

It survived the collapse of that regime to become a cornerstone of Vichy authoritarianism and collaboration. The network of prefects and subprefects on which the ministry was based was left intact even in the occupied zone, which was crucial to the Vichy regime’s aspirations to exercise power there. As theÉtat Français broke with Republican practices in the case of other institutions, moreover, prefects enjoyed a relative rise in power during the Occupation, having been freed from the scrutiny of parliamentarians and local bodies. The climate of suspicion and intolerance at Vichy rendered the Interior Ministry and its prefectoral structure all the more valuable to the new regime—surveillance was greatly heightened, paid informants were used more frequently, and internment on the basis of mere suspicion was not uncommon. <br><br>Through 1942, interior ministers and their subordinates sought to exercise greater police authority in the occupied zone and looked to secure the assent of the occupiers by visibly and vigorously pursuing suspected assassins and “terrorists.” These and other such repressive measures meant to win favor with the German authorities, such as the creation of special police units to deal with Jewish affairs, succeeded mainly in drawing the French law enforcement apparatus into closer collaboration with Nazi violence and repression. By 1943, with all of France occupied, the Germans were encouraging the creation of separate organizations, such as the <i>milice</i>, as more suited to their purposes than the existing French police administration. All the same, purges of prefectoral and police institutions after the liberation were the most extensive of any public administration. <br><br>C.-L.

Under Foreign Minister Pierre Laval, the French pressed for rapprochement with Italy, resulting in the Stresa Accord of April 1935. This agreement among Britain, France, and Italy purported to present a common front against Hitler’s expansionist ambitions. However, France objected to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in the autumn of 1935 and supported the League of Nations’ imposition of sanctions against Italy, resulting in Mussolini’s rapprochement with Hitler and giving rise to a period of tension that lasted until the French collapse in June 1940. <br><br>Italy did not oppose German annexation of Austria in March 1938 and supported Hitler’s position during the Munich Conference; clearly, Mussolini had now chosen to ally with Germany. Italy made known its territorial claims on Tunisia, Djibouti, Corsica, and Nice and the Savoy, all of which directly affected France. The conclusion of the Pact of Steel (22 May 1939) sealed the alliance between Italy and Germany. With the outbreak of war, Mussolini declared that Italy would be a “nonbelligerent” state, but on 10 June 1940, as the French were being crushed by the Blitzkrieg (lightning war), the Italian dictator declared war on Britain and France. Italy’s military operations against France were confined to air attacks on Corsica and Marseilles, an unsuccessful attempt at a landing near Menton, and a failed sortie into France through the Alps. During the war Franco–Italian relations were entirely subordinated to Mussolini’s relationship, as junior partner, with Hitler, and to the latter’s designs on France. On 18–19 June 1940, Mussolini and his foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano met Hitler in Munich to decide on armistice terms for France. Mussolini proposed the severest conditions, including occupation of the whole country and confiscation of the French fleet. Hitler, however, wishing to avoid the possibility of a French decampment to North Africa to pursue the war from there with Britain still fighting, insisted on a milder approach. He had no objections to Italy’s occupation of southeastern France or to its claims on Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti. The Italians went along with Hitler’s wishes. <br><br>On 24 June 1940, at the Villa Incisa near Rome, Marshal Pietro Badoglio and General Charles-Léon Huntziger met to sign the Italo–French armistice. This entitled the Italians to occupy the territory held by their army at the moment the armistice came into effect, thus confining their occupation to the frontier area around Menton. A demilitarized zone of 50 kilometers was also included, with zones 200 kilometers wide in Algeria and in territories bordering on Libya, plus an area in southern Tunisia and the coast of Somaliland. Italy also gained Djibouti and the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railroad, but the armistice contained no economic or financial clauses. The Italian zone was nonetheless considerably enlarged in November 1942, when the Germans extended their own occupation: departments in Italian hands comprised Basses-Alpes, Alpes-Maritimes, Var, Hautes-Alpes, Savoie, Haute-Savoie, and the Drôme, in addition to Corsica and parts of the Rhône valley. <br><br>The differences between Italian and German styles of occupation were highlighted in the summer of 1943 after the collapse of Mussolini’s regime: many Jews and others who had been given refuge in the Italian zone were imprisoned and deported by Vichy and German authorities. <br><br>*P.

In October 1940, he left for London via Gibraltar. Parachuted into France for the first time, in January 1941, with money and a radio transmitter, he created a group initially connected to the Jade-Amicol network. The other person of note in the network was Pierre Hentic, known as Maho, a communist youth militant, who became the head of air and sea operations in 1943. After a first year of organizing and recruiting, the network engaged in the search for military information for the MI6 in London. Eventually, it comprised some ten subnetworks, specializing in both geography and technology throughout France. <br><br>The network collected its most extensive intelligence concerning the location of the German army, aeronautic production, port activity, transmissions both by telephone and telegraph, and the sites of coastal defenses and of the launch pads of the V1 and V2 rockets.

Faced with a Vietnamese declaration of independence after Japan’s surrender, France tried, but failed, to regain Indochina militarily. <br><br>Between the wars, France’s Far Eastern policy consisted of defending the colonial status quo from the challenges of rising Asian nationalism and Japanese militaristic expansionism. Japan’s growing naval power and encroachments on Chinese territory encountered Western disapproval. When the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931, France concurred in the League of Nation’s censure of Japan. This ended Franco–Japanese amity stemming from a 1907 agreement respecting each other’s Asian spheres of interest. Western suspicions of Japan were exacerbated in 1936, when Japan’s military-dominated government signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany. Japan’s war with China in July 1937 and Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoe’s articulation of a New Order for East Asia, a “Co-Prosperity Sphere” under Japanese dominance, led the United States to condemn Japan and ship supplies to Chiang Kai-shek’s Chinese nationalists. <br><br>Germany’s defeat of France and the Netherlands encouraged Japan’s pro-Axis foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka to obtain a neutrality pact with the Soviet Union to prepare an “advance” southward to “liberate” European-held Southeast Asian colonies. To Japan’s security analysts, the attraction of French Indochina was its strategic resources (tin, rubber) and vulnerability under Vichy rule. Due to American retaliatory reduction of exports, especially oil and scrap iron, Japan required new sources of supply to achieve its Great Power aspirations. Under German auspices Japan opened an embassy in Vichy, seeking to extract concessions in Indochina. To stem the flow of supplies via the Hanoi-Nanning Railway to Chiang Kai-shek’s forces in western China, Japan pressured Vichy’s governor of Indochina, Admiral Jean Decoux, to station its troops in north Vietnam (September 1940). Although French administrators continued to govern, this collaboration with Japan was the first step in France’s loss of colonial control. In July 1941, more negotiations with Vichy led to Japanese military occupation of southern Vietnam as well. <br><br>The basis for Franco–Japanese cooperation ended once the Vichy regime was replaced by General de Gaulle’s, and the latter declared war on Japan. In a surprise <i>coup de force </i>on 9 March 1945, the Japanese military arrested their French collaborators, imprisoned them, and seized direct control of Indochina. The coup, however, stimulated the Indochinese Communist Party, under Ho Chi Minh and the revolutionary Vietminh Front, to prepare for a general insurrection, a move made more urgent by de Gaulle’s stated intention to restore the colonial system in Indochina. <br><br>The insurrection began as soon as word of Japan’s surrender arrived (13 August). Within two weeks, the Vietminh controlled most of Vietnam, including major cities. This “August Revolution” precipitated the abdication of puppet emperor Bao Dai (30 August) and Ho Chi Minh’s formal declaration of Vietnamese independence (2 September). Cambodia and Laos followed with similar proclamations. These actions were soon blocked by Chinese Nationalist forces occupying northern Vietnam and British troops entering the south, accompanied by a token Free French force attempting to reoccupy the colony. Several months of military operations and negotiations failed to produce a workable compromise between recolonization and independence for Vietnam. In fall 1946, the long road to eventual French defeat at Dien Bien Phu began. <br><br>Coming after the 1940 defeat, the French military’s inability to restore national honor and prestige through successful reoccupation of Indochina after Japan’s surrender was an additional blow to its morale. This setback contributed to the deterioration of French control in Algeria as well. <br><br>J. E.

Moved by concern for the continuity of the French state and by personal loyalty to Laval, Jardin sought with Laval’s consent to ease the transition from one regime to the next. <br><br>A founding member of the Ordre Nouveau movement in 1930, Jardin later made a brilliant career in the new state railways, until he was called to work in Yves Bouthillier’s Finance Ministry in January 1941. Following a brief spell as cabinet chief to Robert Gibrat, Laval’s secretary of communications, Jardin was called to Laval’s own secretariat and soon became his right-hand man, entrusted with delicate missions. All the while, Jardin’s office and home were notoriously open to Jews and resisters, many of whom he helped to leave the country, along with civil servants on their way to Algeria to join the Resistance. The enmity thus incurred by Jardin forced Laval to send him away to Bern as acting head of the French embassy, there to serve as go-between with Allen Dulles and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as well as French Resistance circles in Switzerland. While covering his activities and preparing a smooth transfer of the French administration, starting with his own embassy, Jardin also helped compromised Vichy figures find refuge in Switzerland, including his friend the writer Paul Morand, whose appointment as Vichy’s last ambassador in Bern he arranged. Despite his many services to the Resistance, Jardin’s refusal to disavow Vichy held him back from returning to France, but he later came to play an important role behind the scenes in French politics. <br><br>P.

He also produced screenplays for a number of successful films. His irreverent journalism frequently brought him into court on charges of “apologies for crime” and “anarchistic propaganda.” In 1939 Jeanson was imprisoned for praising the Jewish refugee Herschel Grynszpan, who had assassinated the German Embassy secretary Ernst vom Rath. At the outbreak of World War II, he displayed his pacifist feelings by signing the tract “Immediate Peace.” <br><br>The war and Occupation proved difficult times for him. Mobilized in 1939, he was soon convicted for having published an article entitled “No, My Daladier, We Will Not Fight Your War” in a left-wing newspaper. Freed in May 1940, he resumed his career as a journalist. In September he founded <i>Aujourd’hui</i>, a daily that maintained its editorial independence as it launched sharp barbs against the Vichy government. Personal attacks against Jeanson from the collaborationist press led the German occupiers to remove him as editor and imprison him in November. Released, rearrested, and again released, Jeanson found himself barred from writing for both press and cinema. In 1942 he escaped further persecution by taking refuge with Parisian friends until the capital was liberated. He then returned to journalism, displaying his wit with fresh enthusiasm.

The movement quickly spread to nearby schools, with some 300 militants by July 1941. With the very tight organization characteristic of most Pétainist groups, members of the Jeunes du Maréchal wore a khaki shirt and blue beret, adopted military style salutes toward their professors, and practiced unarmed military drills, exhibiting early on a fascist orientation, which met with alarm from some school authorities. Approved by Pétain in September 1941 and by the rector of Paris in 1942, the movement was allowed to recruit in schools, youth centers, and establishments of higher education, but its blatant collaboJEUNESSE rationist rhetoric and noisy public displays failed to generate massive support. Internal rivalries and a public call by some leaders to serve in the Wehrmacht further eroded the movement’s credibility and led to its dissolution in May 1943.

It maintained its autonomy within the Association catholique de la jeunesse française (Catholic Association for French Youth), the umbrella organization for five specialized youth groups. During the war, JOC was officially banned but unofficially tolerated in the occupied zone; it remained largely independent in the southern zone.

Nevertheless, many Jocists supported sending volunteers to Germany to minister to French youth laboring there. “I go as a missionary,” announced Marcel Callo, martyred at Mauthausen and beatified in 1987. To avoid the STO, other Jocists joined the <i>maquis </i>and the Resistance group Jeunes chrétiens combattants (Fighting Young Christians).

During the first two years of the Occupation the Scouts concentrated on Jewish education and established children’s homes and agricultural centers in the unoccupied zone. In May 1942, a unified Zionist youth movement, Mouvement de Jeunesse Sioniste (MJS), was founded. When the extensive roundup of foreign Jews started (in Paris in July 1942, followed in the southern zone in August), the fate of the children (whom Pierre Laval asked to deport) was still undecided. Hundreds were collected by the youth movements and by the communist Jewish organization (Solidarité).

As many as 150,000 had come since the end of World War I, first to fill a need for workers in the context of liberal French immigration and naturalization policies of the 1920s and then to flee ever-increasing Nazi oppression in the 1930s. <br><br>As in World War I, many French Jews served in the 1939–1940 campaign, while 30,000 foreign Jews, eager to defend France against the Nazis, also joined the French armed forces. In the wake of the May–June debacle, however, Jews became scapegoats and were subjected to a series of anti-Jewish laws. Vichy eliminated Jews from government and public employment, severely restricted and expropriated Jewish businesses, placed strict limits on Jewish access to higher education as well as to medical and legal professions, revoked the citizenship not only of many recently arrived Jewish immigrants but also of 115,000 Algerian Jews, and gave free reign to anti-Semitic propaganda. Vichy’s first Statut des Juifs, 3 October 1940, specified who was a Jew in terms more severe than those of the Germans. A special government agency, the Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives, was created in March 1941. Headed first by Xavier Vallat and then, from 6 May 1942, by Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, it supervised expropriations, enforced racial laws, and tracked down Jews hunted by Vichy and the Germans. While daily existence became more and more problematic for Jews due to ever-increasing restrictions on their movements and activities, thousands of them were summarily removed from public life entirely and detained in camps. Many others were arrested and held in camps for various infractions or in reprisal for Resistance activity. From these camps Jews were shipped to German death camps, usually to Auschwitz. <br><br>The Germans, in the context of their Final Solution, initiated these deportations and demanded that Vichy supply Jews to fill trains to the east, but French police and administrative personnel organized and carried out numerous roundups of Jews in Paris, Marseilles, and other cities. However, the deportation of foreign Jews from the so-called free zone was actually first suggested by René Bousquet, as was the inclusion of children under 16 among those to be deported. The conditions of detainment and transportation imposed by French authorities on Jews in their custody were just as severe as those imposed by the Germans. By the end of the occupation in August 1944, 75,721 Jews had been deported to the east. Only some 2,800 of these survived. In addition, about 3,000 Jews succumbed to the harsh conditions in French camps, and 1,100 had been executed. The 77,021 victims represent more than 24 percent of the Jewish community present in France at the outset of the Occupation. At the same time, more than three-fourths, or about 250,000, survived, most often disguising their identities or living clandestinely and benefiting from the assistance of those sympathetic to their plight. This widespread complicity of the French people, coupled with the proximity of Spain and Switzerland and large expanses of mountainous or sparsely inhabited terrain, contributed to making the survival rate for Jews in occupied France greater than that of any other country under German control.

The majority of these foreign Jews had emigrated from Eastern Europe and Germany, especially during the 1930s. Most Jews in France lived in Paris, but many fled to the southern zone after the German occupation of the city. <br><br>The most important difference between French and foreign Jews was in their attitudes toward Judaism and toward the state. French Jews, long used to a strong tradition of acculturation, were more trustful of the state and attempted to find legal means of dealing with the Vichy government’s anti-Jewish measures. They were much less likely to participate in Jewish Resistance movements, especially during the first years of the war. Foreign Jews were more likely to view the state as a hostile force and were therefore more willing to go underground. French Jews were more likely to join non-Jewish Resistance groups, their integration facilitated by the fact that the general Resistance in France opposed anti-Semitism, although some members of certain groups expressed anti- Semitic sentiments. Foreign Jews, on the other hand, tended to join Jewish organizations. <br><br>There were also important legal differences in their situations. The first victims of Vichy’s anti-Jewish measures were foreign Jews who were interned and were the first to be deported. Militant foreign Jews, either communist or Zionist, were among the first Jews to join the Resistance. Furthermore, Jews already associated with a communist organization preceded their non-Jewish colleagues in adopting ideas favorable to resistance. Clandestine branches of the official Jewish institutions developed much later, after the roundups of the summer of 1942 and especially after the German occupation of the southern zone in November of that year. <br><br>As with the general Resistance movement, Jewish Resistance groups were diverse and carried out a variety of activities. While the Jewish Resistance was largely nonviolent, sabotage and other violent attacks were the special domain of Jewish communists, indeed, of the communist Resistance in general. Other armed Jewish Resistance groups included the Armée Juive (it became the Organisation Juive de Combat, or the OJC, in 1944), which served as the military arm of other Jewish groups specializing in rescue missions, and the noncommunist Jewish <i>maquis</i>, attached to the Gaullist Secret Army. Other forms of Resistance included polemics. Most of the underground Jewish press in France was the work of Jewish communists. The bulk of Jewish Resistance activities, however, consisted of defensive resistance. Such rescue operations included the placement of Jewish children in non-Jewish homes, the supplying of false identity papers, and the transportation of Jews across the border into Spain and Switzerland. In France, these networks worked under the cover of official Jewish organizations, operating both aboveground and underground. Organizations specializing in the rescue of children include the Oeuvre de Secours à l’Enfance (OSE), the Sixième (the Sixth), a branch of the Israelite Scouts of France (ÉIF), and the Young Zionist Movement (MJS). Tens of thousands of Jews were saved through the efforts of these organizations. <br><br>R.

His book <i>In Stahlgewittern </i>(1920), translated into English as <i>Storm of Steel </i>in 1929, is the journal of the leader of an assault group in World War I. Jünger’s nationalistic leanings led him to various semimilitary adventures in the early days of the Weimar Republic. He also became a lifelong enthusiast for entomology and wrote prolifically about insects. Attracted to extreme right-wing movements, Jünger, however, soon developed strong private doubts about the Nazi regime. He published a novel, <i>Auf den Marmorklippen </i>(On the Marble Cliffs) in 1939, a thinly veiled allegory of totalitarianism. Reactivated as an officer during World War II, Jünger followed the German troops into France and spent extended periods posted there, where he kept a journal, published in 1949 as <i>Strahlungen</i>. Although a strong German nationalist, Jünger was also a humanist, open to the understanding of cultures other than his own. In occupied France, he seized every opportunity offered him as a well-known writer to meet French authors, artists, and other thinkers, mostly collaborationists with Nazi Germany. Fluent in French, he also had a keen sense of how deeply average Frenchmen hated uniformed Germans. <br><br>Jünger, who foresaw German defeat in the war, also became close to Colonel (later, General) Hans Speidel and had advance knowledge of the attempt on Hitler’s life in July 1944.

Opposed to Nazi Germany, he was the only right-wing deputy who, joining one socialist and 75 communists, voted against the 1938 Munich agreement. Rejecting the 1940 armistice and hunted by the Gestapo, Kérillis fled to the United States, where he initially supported General de Gaulle but believed that the general should limit himself to military activity on behalf of the Allies while staying out of politics, a view shared by about a third of the French exiles in the United States. With other such “dissident” journalists, including Geneviève Tabouis and Pertinax (André Géraud), Kérillis founded a newspaper, <i>Pour la Victoire</i>, in January 1942. In a 1945 book entitled <i>De Gaulle dictateur</i>, he later expanded his view of the general as a political usurper. Following the Allied landings in North Africa, November 1942, Kérillis supported the State Department’s attempts to marginalize de Gaulle by dealing with first Admiral Darlan, then General Henri Giraud. Kérillis’ violent articles against de Gaulle in <i>Pour la Victoire </i>were opposed by the American Gaullist organization France Forever. Kérillis greeted the creation of the Comité Français de Libération Nationale in 1943 with a passionate campaign, in which he wrote that, actually hampering the liberation of France, “de Gaulle had installed in Algiers the most dictatorial constitution that France had ever known.” Following the liberation, Kérillis, preferring direct American military rule to de Gaulle, argued that France no longer had a legal government. <br><br>Kérillis and his colleagues, including Alexis Léger, in large measure agreed with Roosevelt, fearing the dictatorial power of de Gaulle, whom they saw as a military man, nationalistic, ambitious, and antidemocratic, with no popular investiture. In addition, however, Kérillis had a son, who had joined Free France, was parachuted into France, then was caught and tortured to death by Gestapo agents.

In 1940 General de Lattre led the 14th Division with distinction against General Heinz Guderian’s panzers during the Battle of France. Following the armistice, he became commander of the 13th military district (Puy-de-Dôme) and established his residence in a medieval chateau in the village of Opme, where he set up a training center to prepare leaders for the regeneration of France, much in the spirit of Uriage. In September 1941 General Maxime Weygand summoned him to strengthen French deLAUBREAUX, fenses in Tunisia. German pressure brought de Lattre’s recall in February 1942, whereupon he became commander of the 16th military district at Montpellier. When German forces crossed the Demarcation Line at the time of the Allied landings in North Africa, de Lattre resisted, but Vichy authorities arrested him and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment. He escaped and made his way to London and Algiers, where de Gaulle appointed him commander of Army Group B, designated to land in Provence (Operation Dragoon) alongside General Alexander M. Patch, Jr.’s Seventh American Army. The rapid success of the Riviera landings enabled de Lattre’s army to liberate Toulon and Marseilles ahead of schedule. He and Patch raced north, and in September their armies linked with Allied forces pressing eastward from Normandy. De Lattre incorporated approximately 135,000 Resistance fighters into what became the First French Army (Rhin et Danube). Under General Jacob Devers’ Sixth Army group, de Lattre’s troops participated in the liberation of Alsace. De Lattre refused to evacuate Strasbourg at the time of the German winter counteroffensive, defying Eisenhower’s orders. The First French Army then resumed the offensive, cleared the Colmar pocket, crossed the Rhine, occupied Stuttgart, and advanced into western Austria. De Lattre represented France at the German surrender ceremony ending hostilities in Europe. He was made marshal of France posthumously in 1952. <br><br>J.-L.

Drafted in 1940, Laurent experienced the French defeat while still in training. He was then attached to the Armistice Army, where he was assigned duties policing the Demarcation Line, which separated the occupied from the unoccupied zones of France. He subsequently served in Vichy’s Information Ministry. As France was being liberated, Laurent was assigned to arrange an escape of Marshal Pétain to the Resistance but failed to prevent the Germans from spiriting Pétain off to Sigmaringen. Joining the Resistance, Laurent served briefly in General de Lattre’s army, then was detained briefly by French authorities before being allowed to go free. <br><br>A highly successful novelist who wrote many of his books under the name “Cécil Saint-Laurent,” after the war, Laurent suggested that there was little difference in the motivations of collaborators and resisters. Antoine, the major protagonist in his 1954 novel, <i>Le Petit Canard</i>, joins the anti-Bolshevik Légion des Volontaires Français out of pique at having been jilted by a woman in favor of a Polish officer, implying that under different circumstances he might as easily have joined the Resistance. This theme was reiterated in the film <i>Lacombe Lucien </i>20 years later. <br><br>To Laurent, Vichy had concealed an anti-German Pétainist resistance that had been subverted by General de Gaulle. De Gaulle’s return to power in 1958 brought out the full force of Laurent’s opposition, in <i>Mauriac sous de Gaulle </i>(1964) and <i>Année 40 </i>(1965), to what he considered the Gaullist myth of <i>résistantialisme</i>.

Twice he was head of the Vichy government after the fall of France. He opposed war in 1939 and sought to ease the fate of a defeated France after June 1940. For Laval, the war was like any other, not the crusade against fascism that Winston Churchill was determined to wage. Laval justified cooperation with Nazi Germany to save France and Europe from the spread of Bolshevism and to spare it the worst consequences of Nazi occupation. To protect the greater number, he would sacrifice foreign Jews and anti-Nazi refugees, communists, and maquisards.<br><br>Laval began his political career as a socialist (Section Française de l’Internationale Ouvrière SFIO) and pacifist deputy on the eve of the First World War, and he was on a list of pacifists and potentially seditious persons to be jailed in the event of war. In November 1917 Georges Clemenceau offered him a position in his new cabinet. Laval declined out of respect for party discipline, but he soon drifted away from the SFIO. His politics veered to the Right, and in 1931, a strong anticommunist, he became premier and foreign minister. Again foreign minister in 1935, Laval signed the Franco–Soviet pact of mutual assistance, after gutting it of substance. Fearful of the spread of communism, Laval signed the pact because an intransigent Hitler left him little choice. Having promised Soviet leader Joseph Stalin speedy ratification, Laval delayed it until his fall from power in January 1936. During the last years before the outbreak of war, Laval remained out of power, nursing grudges against the socialists and Radicals who had overthrown his government. He had a reputation for being a slippery politician with no firm principles; however, there were two consistent courses in Laval’s politics: anti-Bolshevism and a desire for settlement with Nazi Germany. <br><br>When France fell in June 1940, Laval opposed further resistance. In early July, he used his considerable parliamentary skills to engineer the National Assembly vote that gave constituent powers to Marshal Pétain, thereby helping create the État Français in Vichy, where Laval emerged as head of the government. In this role, Laval met Hitler at Montoire (October 1940) to talk conciliation and cooperation. It was inconceivable to Laval that Germany would fail to win the war. He wanted to make the best of it; repatriate French prisoners of war (POWs) and obtain the signature of a peace treaty with Germany. Laval was toppled in December 1940 in a palace intrigue led by Marshal Pétain’s entourage. The German Embassy in Paris threw its protection over Laval, and he survived to return to power. <br><br>In June 1941 the German army invaded the USSR, and in April 1942 German pressure helped return Laval to power. For Laval, the war was a crusade against Bolshevism. “I hope for the victory of Germany,” he said, “because without it, communism would soon be established everywhere in Europe” (June 1942). Laval held to this line even when German victory seemed less certain. To collaborate, he was willing to support the sending of French workers to Germany in exchange for French POWs. He approved the roundup of foreign Jews and other undesirables. When the Nazis did not keep to their bargains, Laval continued to negotiate for negligible concessions. “Laval, the Nazi puppet!” he was called by the Free French on the BBC.<br><br>By early 1944 Laval supported an all-out campaign against the anti-Nazi Resistance. In June 1944 he urged the French to stay neutral and not to assist Allied forces, though at the end of 1943 he had advocated all-out war against French communists and “terrorists.” For his efforts, the retreating German army arrested Laval and Pétain and took them off to Germany as hostages. It hardly acquitted Laval of his role in the Vichy government, and he was turned over to French authorities in August 1945. In October, Laval was condemned to death in a drumhead trial, before jurors who taunted him and a judge and prosecutor who had served the Vichy government. He attempted suicide on the morning of his execution but was revived to be dragged, staggering and vomiting, to his firing squad. <br><br>*Y.-F.

The legion appealed more to former members of conservative veterans’ associations such as the Union National des Combattants than to left-wing veterans; war cripples, whose dependence on the state had influenced their politics, were particularly dubious about the legion. The head of the legion, François Valentin, was a former member of Colonel François de la Rocque’s Parti Social Français. The average age of legionnaires was around 50, and it appealed more to veterans of the 1914–1918 war than to those of the 1940 war. Finally, the legion appealed more to those in the countryside more than those in the city: in the Loire 60 percent of the legionnaires were peasants, and only 4.5 percent of them were urban workers. In France as a whole the legion and some of its associated bodies claimed around 1.5 million members at the movement’s peak in 1941. <br><br>As time went on, the legion began to experience problems.

From a Jewish Alsatian family and on the commercial staff of a jute weaving firm, he was drafted as a lieutenant in artillery in September 1939 and took refuge in Lyons, where he took up his trade again at the end of 1940. Anti-Nazi and wishing to fight against Vichy, he contacted Antoine Avinin and through him joined the France-Liberté group, which included Auguste Pinton, Noe¨l Clavier, Elie Péju, and Jean-Jacques Soudeille. Lévy was the first to propose creating a clandestine newspaper, the <i>Franc-Tireur</i>, which appeared in December 1941. Around this paper there soon formed a movement with the same name. Young, with no political past, but profoundly Republican, democratic, and anti-Vichy, Lévy took over the leadership, thanks to his organizational skills and his profession, which allowed him to travel. In 1942 he met Henri Frenay and Emmanuel d’Astier, the leaders of Combat and Libération, respectively, and then General de Gaulle’s emissary, Jean Moulin, who was impressed by Lévy’s moderation. In favor of recognizing General de Gaulle as leader of the Resistance, he played the role of conciliator with the leaders of Combat and Libération, accepting the formation of the Secret Army, and then the establishment of the Mouvements Unis de Résistance. Interrogated three times in Lyons by the French police in 1941 and 1942, Lévy went into hiding. Shortly after returning from a trip to London, in September 1943, Lévy was installed in Paris as representative of Franc-Tireur to the Conseil National de la Résistance. Arrested in October 1943, he was imprisoned in the Santé, from which a Franc-Tireur commando was able to free him in June 1944.

Most of the country, however, was liberated between July and October 1944 through the efforts of the Allied armies and the Resistance. France has no common date of liberation. <br><br>The “liberation,” however, stands for more than the military struggle. It often refers to the few days during which the Germans withdrew from an area, and the local Resistance assumed control. These were highly emotional days, filled with symbolic gestures such as maquisard parades and public head-shavings of women accused as “horizontal collaborators.” The “liberation” also refers to the entire troubled period encompassing the restoration of Republican government in Paris, the resumption of electoral democracy, the purge of collaborators, and the deterioration of food supplies. This period might be dated from 6 June 1944 to the time of the return of the political deportees and prisoners of war from German captivity in April and May 1945, to de Gaulle’s resignation as president on 20 January 1946, or to the acceptance of a new constitution in November 1946.

The movement was built around a group that signed, on 15 November 1940, the “Manifesto of the Twelve,” consisting of syndicalists who had formed a committee of economic and syndicalist studies. Among the signers of this manifesto are to be found nine Confédération Générale du Travail (GCT) members: Oreste Capocci, François Chevalme, Albert Gazier, Eugène Jaccoud, Robert Lacoste, Pierre Neumeyer, Christian Pineau, Louis Saillant, and Victor Vandeputte; and three Christian syndicalists: Maurice Bouladoux, Gaston Tessier, and Jules Zirnheld. The work of this committee was published regularly in a legalized bulletin that served as a cover for the clandestine newspaper <i>Libération-nord</i>, whose first issue appeared 1 December 1940. The first issues of the newspaper were edited and produced by Pineau, who used the BBC as his main source of information. <br><br>The Liberation-nord movement, whose official birth was announced in its newspaper of 30 November 1941, expressed the syndicalist viewpoint of the noncommunist elements of the clandestine GCT, the Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens, and the socialists in the Resistance.

Following Pineau’s return from his first trip to London in the spring of 1942, the Liberation-nord movement was largely under socialist influence.

Described by Catholic critics as the “red cardinal” because of his support of the organized textile workers of his diocese, Liénart was also critical of Action Française and the right-wing Fédération Nationale Catholique. Enmeshed in the anti-Bolshevism characteristic of the interwar French church, he rejected communist overtures to the Catholics. A patriot, Liénart chose in 1940 to remain at his post as pastor and urged the defeated French neither to side with the victor nor to resist. Nonetheless, he was caught up in the episcopate’s collective support and veneration of Pétain. Like his colleagues, Liénart was happy to see a pro-Catholic state replace the Third Republic, even though Vichy was authoritarian. <br><br>In spite of this he remained circumspect, and his lack of enthusiasm for Nazi Germany made him suspect in the eyes of the occupiers. He was also critical of Vichy’s Labor Charter, which abolished free trade unions. Liénart also joined other church leaders in protesting the roundup of Jews at the Vélodrome d’hiver in Paris (July 1942). Liénart’s main resistance activity was his vigorous protest against the labor requisition program, the Service du Travail Obligatoire. Achille Liénart’s career as a prince of the church was fraught with ambivalence. His anticommunism and suspicion of the Republic inclined him favorably toward Pétain.

After the defeat of France, Madagascar was to be ceded to the Reich, which would then establish a “colony” of European Jews there who could be supervised by the SS. The transfer, which would be funded by the sale of seized Jewish property, was to provide for a “solution” to the “Jewish Question,” although it is unlikely that it was ever conceived of as the Final Solution. Reinhard Heydrich, in particular, liked the plan, and it was used primarily for propaganda purposes, convincing both Jewish prisoners and concerned Germans that the deportation of Jews was part of a benevolent plan. Evidence for this is suggested by the fact that Hitler continued to speak of the plan as late as October 1942, by which time at least 2 million Jews had already been murdered.

Based on funding voted upon in the Chamber of Deputies in 1929, these fortifications aptly carried the name of war minister André Maginot, a wounded veteran of World War I. The building of the Maginot Line reflected a civilian and military consensus in the 1920s reflecting a shared appreciation of the demographic and economic losses of World War I. With military service requirements reduced from three years to one under popular pressure during this decade, the High Command formulated the military doctrine of total defense of French soil. <br><br>Originally, the Maginot Line was to provide security against a German attack, but it also underlined France’s unwillingness to undertake offensive military planning after the four-power 1925 Locarno agreement that was to guarantee the Franco–German border. The Maginot Line also enhanced the lengthy mobilization plans and wait for Allies that had come to characterize French war planning. Finally, a “Maginot mentality” produced an unwillingness or inability to fulfill eastern alliance obligations, an all-or-nothing approach to mobilization that precluded graduated deterrence, and a reluctance among generals and politicians to consider military innovation or psychologically prepare the French nation for war. <br><br>The still-controversial decision not to extend the line from the Ardennes to the North Sea helped ensure that a German attack would occur in Belgium rather than in France, but a Belgian shift to neutrality after German remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 further confused French planning. When the German Blitzkrieg finally hit on 10 May 1940, the Maginot Line played a very minor role in an ensuing battle characterized by a panzer drive through the Ardennes as the bulk of the French army misguidedly moved into beleaguered Belgium.

Maillol is considered one of the most important figures in the transition from the style of Rodin to modernist sculpture. Celebrated in France during the early twentieth century, his popularity began to decline in the 1930s. The rise of Nazism boosted his career because the Nazis greatly admired his art, seeing in it the manifestation of their ideals of heroism and nostalgia for a simple agrarian life. Invited to tour Germany in 1942 with other French sculptors, he declined because of his advanced age. <br><br>Maillol’s relationship to the Nazis was not entirely clear. He did not object to Nazi control over art, and throughout the war he exhibited in shows that they promoted. Furthermore, his son was a member of the Milice Française. However, Maillol’s Jewish model, Dina Vierny, ran a small Resistance network of which he was aware. Moreover, he allowed his studio in Puyg del Mas to be used as a hiding place for refugees and resisters escaping to Spain. When Vierny was arrested by the Germans, Maillol’s friend Arno Breker got her released. Nazi approval of Maillol’s work led to recriminations after the liberation.

In the same year he and André Gide traveled to Germany, seeking the release of prominent communists charged with the Reichstag fire. Copresident of the World Committee against Fascism, he fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war. Following the Spanish Republican defeat in 1939, Malraux returned to France. Disillusioned by the Nazi–Soviet nonaggression pact, he volunteered for military service in September 1939. Assigned to a tank division situated far from the front lines, he was taken prisoner in the retreat of June 1940. He escaped in September 1940 and sought refuge in the unoccupied zone, where for two years he led an apolitical life. When Germany occupied the southern zone in November 1942, Malraux moved inland from the Mediterranean to Périgord, where his brother was a maquisard. Adopting the code name Colonel Berger, Malraux joined the Resistance in 1944, coordinating the <i>maquis </i>units in his region. Working with British agents, he supervised a massive arms drop in July 1944 that enabled the maquisards to obstruct the German army as it moved north. Captured days later, imprisoned, and interrogated by the Gestapo, he was freed on 18 August 1944 by the German retreat from Toulouse. Appointed commander of the Alsace-Lorraine Brigade, he and his unit fought vigorously during the fall of 1944 to liberate Alsace. He broke with the communists in January 1945, joined the Movement de libération national, and in 1946 served briefly as minister of information. Henceforth a devoted Gaullist, Malraux returned to politics in 1959 as de Gaulle’s minister of cultural affairs, a position he held until 1969. In 1996, 20 years after his death, in a high honor to his memory, Malraux’s remains were transferred to the Panthéon of France. <br><br>*†J. Lacouture, <i>André Malraux </i>(New York, 1975); H.

In 1936 he advocated the formation of a National Union government, and he pressed for a Franco–Soviet military alliance. France, he argued, had either to abdicate its security interests in Eastern Europe, or collaborate with all those countries threatened by Nazi Germany. One of the last Clemencists, he was convinced that war with Nazi Germany was inevitable, and he preferred to get on with it sooner rather than later. In 1938 Mandel opposed the Munich agreement. Some thought Mandel might be a second Clemenceau, but his religion got in the way. The Right accused him of being a warmonger, advocating resistance to Nazism because he was a Jew. In September 1939 he stood for an immediate offensive against the German army; instead, France waged the Phoney War. After the collapse of the French front in 1940, Mandel remained defiant. The British tried unsuccessfully to rescue Mandel from Morocco, where he had gone in June 1940. Local authorities blocked the attempt.

There were some attempts at sabotage, early on, quickly punished by execution. In the unoccupied zone, large, wooded regions offered an ideal site for military resisters, although it took time after the shock of the 1940 defeat to get sufficient recruits. In June 1941, after the German invasion of Soviet Russia, the situation changed dramatically. Since all Communist and Socialist Party members were hunted, many of them went into hiding. The thinly populated existing <i>maquis </i>grew, and new networks were created, often close to German garrisons. When forced labor for all young Frenchmen, the Service du Travail Obligatoire, was initiated, many joined the various <i>maquis </i>as <i>réfractaires </i>(objectors). Still, arms were scarce. Increasing, but still insufficient, air drops by the Allies helped. The occupation of all of France in November 1942 eased communication between the two formerly separated zones. While the north afforded few opportunities for clandestine military operations, the southern zone saw many surprise attacks on German forces, harassing them, inhibiting their movements, and inflicting casualties. The Germans retaliated brutally. <br><br>As coordination progressed, and the various politically different segments of the Resistance became unified, <i>maquis </i>operations gradually grew more effective. These political differences went from the extreme Right and from military career officers to moderate, socialist, and communist units. The communists frequently tried to ensure the predominance of their party after the liberation. In London, however, the French counterintelligence under Colonel Passy often overstated communist influence, leading, in one case, to the failure to air-drop arms to the <i>maquis </i>prior to its decimation at the Battle of Vercors. The military command of the unified Resistance tried to avoid casualties wherever possible, as the main goal of all armed Resistance was to coordinate their efforts with an eventual Allied landing. Nonetheless, assisted by the railroad workers’ sabotage of both track and rolling stock, still underarmed but determined, the <i>maquis </i>of the Massif Central inflicted heavy losses on superior German forces supported by tanks and planes. After D-Day, the <i>maquis </i>of Normandy and Brittany supported the Allied landing operations. Their assistance was acknowledged by General Eisenhower as invaluable in producing the success of Operation Overlord. <i>Maquis </i>units also delayed reinforcements the Germans tried to bring from southwest France to the Normandy front. <br><br>The psychological impact of the <i>maquis </i>on the German soldiers cannot be overestimated. Military and police, including the Gestapo, saw the <i>maquis </i>as a constant threat throughout early 1944. The liberation of France was due primarily to the Allied forces, but their action was powerfully seconded by the French Forces of the Interior (FFI), which suffered heavy losses throughout the campaign.

Four of his works, labeled “degenerate” by the Nazis, were among those confiscated from German museums and sold at auction on 30 June 1939 in Lucerne. <br><br>Writer Louis Aragon said that Matisse personified France and the continuity of its great cultural traditions during its darkest hours. At the time of the 1940 defeat, Matisse was on his way to Genoa, intending to depart for Rio de Janeiro, but decided instead to remain in France. Returning to his home in Nice, he joined the local affiliate of the Emergency Rescue Committee and helped other artists who were without scarce materials by sending them some of his own supplies. In late 1940 he declined two invitations to emigrate to America. After a lengthy hospital stay in Lyons, where he underwent cancer surgery early in 1941, he returned to Nice. Despite the prior labeling of his paintings as “degenerate” art, the German Propaganda Ministry, in concert with Vichy, invited Matisse to visit Germany in November 1941, but he declined. He gave two interviews, discussing art and critiquing the French academic Beaux-Arts system on Vichy radio early in 1942, but in general lived quietly, producing many paintings, drawings, painted-paper cutouts, and illustrations for several books.

His early work was characterized by a concern with the conflict between Catholic morality and the modern world, and he became a leader of the Catholic literary revival of the 1920s and 1930s. His 1927 novel, <i>Thérèse Desqueyneux</i>, remains one of the most influential novels of modern France, and Mauriac was elected to the French Academy in 1933. The years that followed saw him shift away from specifically Catholic themes toward more broadly defined spiritual and political ones. He became, along with Jacques Maritain, Emmanuel Mounier, and, later, Georges Bernanos, a fixture of the Catholic Left and joined with them in supporting the Spanish Republic. <br><br>Although his wartime legacy is usually remembered for his Resistance activity, Mauriac had been somewhat slow to take this side. With the defeat in 1940, he had unambiguously supported Marshal Pétain, exemplifying what Robert Paxton has called the “self-flagellation” wing of French Catholicism that blamed the defeat on French “decadence.” However, anti-German, he was horrified in particular by the anti-Jewish laws. Rejecting the ideology of the National Revolution, Mauriac made contact with Resistance circles by late 1941 and found his way into the Comité national des écrivains, becoming the only member of the academy to be an active resister. His political commitment grew throughout 1942, and, under the pseudonym “Forez,” he wrote the famous <i>Cahier noir</i>, an attack on Vichy hypocrisy. As editor of the underground <i>Lettres Françaises</i>, Mauriac was increasingly of the opinion that the proletariat, whom he regarded as more inclined to resistance, were the only hope for France. This political stance was to characterize his postwar work as well, where he was a consistently left-of-center columnist for <i>L’Express </i>and a dedicated antiimperialist.

During the first four decades of the twentieth century, Maurras stood as the most influential thinker of the nationalist Right. His daily editorials in the <i>Action Française </i>newspaper mixed sophisticated political analysis with vituperative, often vicious attacks on the enemies of “true” France—which included liberals, socialists, communists, Freemasons, foreigners, Protestants, and most especially by the late 1930s, Jews.

The promise of the National Revolution—with the notable exception of the institution of monarchy—came close to fulfilling Maurras restorationist-exclusivist vision for France: a state that was authoritarian and a society informed by the principles of order, hierarchy, and corporate organization; and finally, a discrimination, written into law, that separated “alien” groups, particularly Jews, from the national community. Though Maurras refused all personal contact with the Paris collaborators, many of whom had passed through Action Française ranks, his daily editorials reflected his growing obsession for “unity” and against those who would disturb it—unrepentant Republicans, Anglo-American sympathizers, and, especially, Gaullist “terrorists” and their “Judeo-Bolshevik” allies.

Entering Paris in June 1940 amid the exodus of virtually three-quarters of the city’s population, German officers quickly made Maxim’s their own. When owner Louis Vaudable returned two months later, he found his establishment crowded with this new clientele and managed by a German officer, Otto Horcher. In truth, Vaudable was lucky, because Horcher was one of a distinguished family of Berlin restaurateurs. During the Occupation the Germans treated Maxim’s and its owner with favoritism and did not requisition the restaurant for their own exclusive use. Indeed, uniformed Germans were not allowed in the main dining room but were relegated to the second-floor dining rooms. In May 1941, when the Germans divided restaurants into four categories, Maxim’s was placed among the “exceptional” ones that did not suffer food restrictions. Moreover, under Horcher’s protection its employees were not deported to German labor camps. Ironically, Maxim’s enjoyed one of its most prosperous eras. <br><br>Maxim’s list of collaborationist and German celebrities is long and impressive, including the German ambassador and Francophile Otto Abetz and the writer Ernst Jünger, as well as Hermann Göring and other Nazi leaders officially visiting Paris.

A Parisian, Mayer joined the Socialist Party (SFIO) in 1927 and was active in the socialist youth movement before becoming a journalist with the socialist daily <i>Le Populaire, </i>reporting on social affairs. He was close to Léon Blum, who advised him to remain in France after the defeat of 1940. With great energy Mayer gathered demoralized socialists and in March 1941 founded and led the clandestine Comité d’action Socialiste.

Shortly afterward, the SFIO was formally reconstituted, with a policy of support for de Gaulle and with Mayer as general secretary. Nominated by de Gaulle as <i>Commissaire </i>for communications and transport, Mayer was also a member of the Comité Française de Libération Nationale and represented his party on the Conseil National de la Resistance, where he helped define the political aspirations of the liberation. He sought to preserve the unity of the Resistance and explored prospects for a political merger between communists and socialists, possibly in a single Labor Party. The plan made limited progress but was decisively rejected by Blum on his return from deportation. Mayer played a central role in defining the socialists’ policies in government. He was consequently a victim of the party’s failure to live up to postwar expectations. In August 1946 the party congress voted to replace him as general secretary with Guy Mollet. Mayer went on to a long and distinguished public career, serving as cabinet minister from 1946 through 1949, as president of the <i>Ligue des droits de l’homme </i>(League of the Rights of Man), 1958–1975, and as president of the Conseil constitutionnel (Constitutional Council), 1983–1986. <br><br>†C.

A Royal Navy task force attacked a French naval squadron at anchor at Mers-el-Kébir. The unexpected action against an erstwhile ally showed that Britain was determined to ensure that the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean would never tip against it, despite Admiral Jean-François Darlan’s repeated assurances that no French ship would ever fall into German hands. <br><br>The French squadron under Vice-Admiral Marcel Gensoul, which included the modern battle cruisers <i>Dunkerque </i>and <i>Strasbourg</i>, was caught by surprise. Gensoul was asked by the British to choose among four options or witness the destruction of his ships at point-blank range. He could sail with the British and continue the fight against the Germans and Italians, sail to a British port from which he and his crews would be repatriated, sail to a French port in the West Indies, or scuttle his fleet on the spot. Gensoul rejected the ultimatum as counter to French honor—it was made under the threat of force, and accepting any of its terms would have violated the Franco–German armistice—and said he was prepared to defend himself. <br><br>Given Gensoul’s stance and knowing that Vichy had ordered reinforcements to Mers-el-Kébir, the Royal Navy opened fire.

On 5 January 1943 Marshal Pétain transformed the Service d’Ordre Légionnaire into the Milice Nationale, an elite organization built upon veterans of the 1930s right-wing conspiratorial <i>cagoule</i>, who, disappointed by the Vichy’s Legion Française des Combattants, wanted a single, committed National Revolution party. Nominally headed by Pierre Laval, it was directed by Joseph Darnand.<br><br>At the founding meeting Darnand envisioned <i>miliciens </i>effecting general “intellectual, social and political renewal” in the civil service and in agricultural, business, legal, and medical associations. A civilian elite, trained in the milice’s <i>École des cadres</i>, was envisioned as a new elite, co-opting all others, in Vichy France. In reality, however, this new civilian elite was stillborn, eclipsed by the milice’s military branch, the Franc-Garde. <br><br>The Franc-Garde’s senior officers received six-months of training at Uriage, while the higher officials nationwide had two-to three-week sessions. The Uriage <i>milice </i>school was headed by Acadian American Catholic royalist Pierre-Louis de La Ney du Vair, with ex-<i>cagoulard </i>counterinsurgency expert Jacques Duge de Bernonville as study director. Mystic La Ney du Vair was replaced by brutal Jean de Vaugelas—who, with de Bernonville, later commanded the attack of 1,000 <i>miliciens </i>and gendarmes on the Glières plateau Resistance fighters. Anticommunist counterinsurgency and hunting down Jews and Masons promoted contacts with the Germans. (Paul Touvier was in the first Uriage cohort.) By June 1943 there were about 35,000 <i>miliciens</i>, including 15,000 Francs-Gardes, many of them monarchist, Maurrasian, ultra-Catholic and Action Française, but with the youngest often proudly “fascist.” The Germans distrusted them, allowing them to be armed only in extremis in November 1943. <br><br>In July 1943, Laval authorized French membership in the Waffen SS; in August Darnand vowed fidelity to Hitler and was named SS <i>Obersturmführer</i>. By early autumn as many as 300 <i>miliciens </i>joined the Waffen SS, many to fight on the eastern front. From January 1944 up to 4,000 Francs-Gardes were working with the Germans in the northern zone. During the French civil war of 1944, the État milicien made the Vichy government fascist in all but name. The <i>milice </i>controlled several prefectures, all French police, the media (with Philippe Henriot on the radio), and the prison, and the justice systems (<i>milice </i>judges holding court). As late as 5 June 1944—the eve of the Normandy landings—Pétain still addressed the <i>milice </i>as the most “faithful” of his soldiers. As the <i>milice </i>“mopped up” after the Germans, they were hated and attacked. In return, the miliciens used torture on their countrymen. At the liberation, about 1,500 <i>miliciens </i>were shot.

In 1994, Mitterrand’s activity during World War II became a lightning rod for recriminations over how to remember the war in France. <br><br>Born into an affluent family in Jarnac in the Charente, Mitterrand received a Catholic education, came to Paris in 1934 to study political science and law, and supported the nationalist Croix-de-feu. Photographs of the era show him participating in right-wing demonstrations. Wounded during the Battle of France, Mitterrand was taken prisoner. In December 1941 he escaped and in January 1942 made his way to Vichy, where he was given a post in the documentation service of the Légion Française des Combattants, which he held until April 1942. He next joined the Board of Rehabilitation of Prisoners of War, where he remained until January 1943, when he, along with several others on the board, resigned after refusing to support Pierre Laval’s Relève. Mitterrand, however, kept a position within the board’s mutual aid bureaucracy and, in December 1943, was awarded the <i>francisque</i>, a high decoration by the Vichy government. <br><br>By 1943, however, Mitterrand had shifted his allegiance toward the Resistance. Supporting General Henri Giraud, Mitterrand in the spring began to infiltrate the Board of Prisoners and to receive funds from the Organization of Armed Resistance (ORA). Following the eclipse of Giraud by General de Gaulle, Mitterrand in November traveled to London, and the next month in Algiers he met de Gaulle, who put him in charge of unifying the Resistance factions of war prisoners. He returned to France in February 1944. Instrumental in creating the unified Mouvement national des prisonniers de guerre, Mitterrand became its head on 12 March 1944. During the spring of 1944, Mitterrand’s activities in Paris brought him into contact with another resister, Danielle Gouze, whom he married in October, shortly after the liberation. Under the Provisional Government Mitterrand became president of the Mouvement national des prisonniers de guerre et déportés, involved with the return of hundreds of thousands of prisoners and deportees at the end of the war. In 1946, he was elected to the French parliament. He held cabinet posts in the Fourth Republic, reorganized the Socialist Party in the early 1970s, and was elected the first socialist president of the Fifth Republic in 1981. <br><br>As president, Mitterrand refused to accept blame on behalf of the Republic for the misdeeds of Vichy, arguing that Vichy and the Republic were different entities. He continued to socialize with former Vichy police minister René Bousquet at least until 1986 and had wreaths laid at Marshal Pétain’s grave every Armistice Day (11 November) from 1986 through 1992. Suggestions were made that the president used his influence to protect friends from his 1930s right-wing days, such as those who were later in high places in L’Oréal cosmetics company, whose founder, Eugène Schueller, had supported Eugène Deloncle and the collaborationist Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire during the Occupation. One of France’s most prestigious companies, L’Oréal was involved in the postwar Arab boycott of Israel. <br><br>The publication of a history of Mitterrand’s early career by Pierre Péan in 1994, for which the president had allowed himself to be interviewed, together with an appearance on French television and other statements by Mitterrand toward the end of his presidency, gave wide publicity to his wartime record, which had been only vaguely known in France.

Hitler wanted French logistic support against the British, notably in Africa. Yet little was said on these subjects at the meetings themselves, which produced nothing concrete.

After the fall of France, he endorsed Marshal Pétain, only to realize very soon the disastrous orientation of the Vichy regime. De Monzie’s frank and unabashed criticism did not endear him to the Vichy government, while at the same time he was mistrusted by the Resistance. After the liberation, De Monzie for years was kept under investigation of treason without charges being formally raised against him. Embittered by what he called the “new inquisition,” de Monzie kept more and more to himself. He died in 1947.

A keen observer of modernism and the changes in social mores in the interwar years, Morand was also fascinated by the United States and by the French colonies and wrote innovative travel chronicles, focusing on future global demographic and economic challenges rather than exoticism. In the mid-1930s, his cultivated image of elegant insolence seemed to give way in his writings to a condemnation of “decadence” and a return to tradition. After 1940, Morand’s career followed that of Pierre Laval, a personal friend. Leaving a post in France’s economic war mission in London shortly after the 1940 armistice, Morand arrived hopeful for a post in Vichy, but he had left London without authorization, and Laval either could not or would not help him. When Laval was dismissed in December 1940, Morand followed him to Paris. There Morand socialized with longtime friends such as Jean Cocteau and Gaston Gallimard and German cultural figures such as Ernst Jünger, while contributing occasionally to such collaborationist publications as <i>La Gerbe </i>or <i>Combats </i>(not to be confused with the Resistance organization and newspaper <i>Combat</i>).<br><br>An ostensibly neutral observer of the Parisian scene, Morand promoted in his <i>Chroniques de l’homme maigre </i>(1941) the model of an invigorated, selfdisciplined, lean as opposed to flabby Frenchman in opposition to demagogues, pessimists, or quitters. With Laval’s return to power in April 1942, Morand was named director of the film-censoring commission. Appointed Vichy’s ambassador to Bucharest in July 1943, then to Bern in July 1944, he was removed following the liberation in September 1944 as part of a general administrative purge.<br><br>Exiled for 10 years, Morand returned to Paris in 1954 and, though disgraced, continued writing. He sought election to the Académie française in 1959 but was opposed by General de Gaulle, among others. In 1968, however, he was elected to the Académie.

During the German invasion, he was prefect in Eure-et-Loir, after having worked in the cabinet of air minister Jean Cot. Refusing to cooperate with the German invaders, who reached Chartres 17 June 1940, Moulin was beaten, imprisoned, and then released. Marshal Pétain dismissed him from his post on 2 November 1940. Leaving Chartres under the name of Joseph Mercier, Moulin went to Saint- Andiol in southern France, where he began collecting information about the nascent Resistance movements, meeting Henri Frenay in Marseilles and François de Menthon in Lyons. <br><br>On 19 October 1941 he left for London. There, on 25 October 1941, he met General de Gaulle, to whom he gave a “<i>Rapport sur l’activité, les projets et les besoins des groupements constitués en France en vue de la libération du territoire national</i>“ (Report on the Activity, Projects, and Needs of the Groups Constituted in France in View of the Liberation of the National Territory), the most extensive document about the Resistance in metropolitan France. It covered the groups Liberté led by François de Menthon in Lyons; Libération Nationale, led by Henri Frenay in Lyons; and Libération, led by Emmanuel d’Astier de la Vigerie in Marseilles, Clermont-Ferrand, and Lyons. There seems to have been an immediate and reciprocal understanding between Moulin and de Gaulle, the general sending him back to the continent to collect documents about the internal Resistance, to represent him in the metropole, and to forward orders and messages from London to France. <br><br>Known as Rex, Max, and Régis, Moulin set up the Bureau d’Information et de Propagande, with Georges Bidault as its head; the Comité Général d’Études, to prepare for the postwar French political regime; the Noyautage des Administrations Publiques (Subversion of Public Administration), with Claude Bourdet as leader; and the Armée Secrète, headed by Charles Delestraint. Delegating responsibilities, Moulin also distributed funds and weapons. His interests in drawing and painting provided him with a professional cover during his Resistance years. In Nice, he owned an art gallery under his artist’s name of Romanin. After a second visit to London, from February to March 1943, he unified most of the Resistance movements in metropolitan France, creating the Mouvements Unis de Résistance, and convened the first Conseil National de la Résistance on 27 May 1943. <br><br>Moulin’s success exacerbated rivalries within the French Resistance with Frenay, d’Astier de la Vigerie, and Pierre Brossolette. A renewed campaign by the Gestapo against resisters, carelessness on the part of his associates, and perhaps treason (René Hardy being the foremost suspect) led to his capture at Caluire on 21 June 1943. Moulin officially died near Metz on 8 July 1943. Posthumous attacks by Frenay, Klaus Barbie, Charles Benfredj, and Thierry Wolton, all claiming without supporting documentation that Moulin was a secret agent of communism, attest to the symbolic, as well as the historic, importance of Jean Moulin. <br><br>J.-P.

With a few well-known elders such as Jacques Maritain, Nicholas Berdyaev, and Gabriel Marcel, he founded the review <i>Esprit </i>in 1932. At the outbreak of the war Mounier was the acknowledged leader of the personalist movement, one of the most influential antiliberal communitarian philosophies of interwar Europe; his relatively small-circulation review “defending the human person against the communalism of the Left and the individualism of the Right,” although erudite and difficult to read, had become one of the most influential of the 1930s. <br><br>After the Munich crisis, Mounier—with like-minded young critics of liberal democratic institutions such as anti-Munich agreement journalist Hubert Beuve-Méry (later founder of the newspaper <i>Le Monde</i>)—declared that France could survive the fascist challenge only by undergoing its own total revolution. With the advent of the Vichy regime Mounier and “Beuve” helped establish communitarian personalism at the youth movements’ preeminent École Nationale Supérieure des Cadres d’<i>Uriage</i>, as well as in Uriage’s myriad satellite schools and in other organizations charged with training new leaders. <br><br>Mounier’s enemies in <i>Action Française</i>, as well as among traditionalist Catholics and the crypto-Nazis, engineered his elimination from Uriage and the silencing of <i>Esprit </i>by the fall of 1941. He was even imprisoned in 1942 for alleged ties to the Combat Resistance group and engaged in a hunger strike that, celebrated by Resistance propaganda, permanently damaged his health. After his release he refrained from political activity but turned to refashioning personalism as a left-wing/progressive/communitarian ideology for postwar France. At the liberation of Paris—thanks to the Uriage/progressive Catholic/ <i>Le Monde </i>network—Mounier was able to get the materials and permissions to relaunch <i>Esprit </i>months before other reviews and establish his reputation as an early resister, a consistent progressive Catholic, and a pioneer in a Resistancenurtured Christian–communist cooperation. <br><br>*J.-M.

Meanwhile, the MLN’s practical work focused on intelligence and propaganda. <br><br>It published a small clandestine newspaper, <i>Les Petites Ailes</i>, which became <i>Vérités, </i>reflecting the aim of countering Vichy propaganda by publicizing the damage caused by the German occupation and official collaboration.

Beginning in the southeast, the MLN spread throughout the south and even developed a small presence in the north.

The purpose of the movement was to form the basis for a broad political party of the Left and center that could become a Republican party of government after the war. Undercut by the formation of separate Communist, Socialist, and Christian democratic parties, this MLN divided and dispersed.

Each of the three movements retained its own propaganda and publishing activities. The MUR was based on a separation of functions between military and political affairs and between national and regional operations. For security reasons, liaison was mainly confined to vertical lines of communication within functions, and the limited attempts at horizontal liaison tended to produce a high administrative burden.

Ostensibly, the Munich agreement focused on selfdetermination for the Sudeten Germans, but it really concerned European security and the German quest for hegemony. <br><br>Soviet, Czech, and Anglo–French diplomats recognized the German threat to Czechoslovakia, which the Franco–Soviet and Czech–Soviet mutual assistance pacts of 1935 were intended to counter. After the German remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, the French army lost its capability to attack in the west to relieve Czechoslovakia should it be attacked. In addition, the French High Command had no offensive plans against Nazi Germany. The French failure to react was symptomatic of a loss of confidence in their power. These divisions were exacerbated by the electoral victory of the Popular Front and the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. The French government became dependent on Britain, which did not want important continental commitments and did not have, nor wish to build up, an army to support them. <br><br>The German annexation of Austria in March 1938 made Czechoslovakia the next logical target and set in motion the process leading to the Munich crisis. At the same time the French and British governments determined that they could not defend Czechoslovakia and that the Czech government must make concessions. Poland, in theory a French ally but hostile to Czechoslovakia, refused support. All these factors led to heavy Anglo–French pressure on Czechoslovakia to yield to German demands. The USSR offered staff talks, but the French did not want them, and the Czechs would not fight with the Soviet Union as its only ally. At the same time Poland threatened war to seize the Teschen region. All these factors led to Anglo–French capitulation in spite of efforts by <i>bellicistes </i>to avert it. In May 1937 French foreign minister Yvon Delbos had observed that France could not abandon Czechoslovakia “without disappearing as a great power from the map of Europe.” Delbos’ observation proved to be correct. <br><br>*J.-B.

case 630: $("div#commentary").html('<b>NATIONAL REVOLUTION (la Révolution Nationale)</b> was the name given to the Vichy government’s (État Français) program of French renewal during the 1940–1944 Occupation. It was described by Raymond Postal in a pro-Vichy compendium in 1941 as the revival of a mystique of France centered around Marshal Pétain, who would lead France to the recovery of its spiritual values and political standing in Europe, lost by a so-called decadent Third Republic that had brought on the disaster of 1940. <br><br>The National Revolution was domestic, produced by the French, who turned in large numbers against the Republic, deemed responsible for the 1940 debacle. For many it was an opportunity to remake France in what appeared to be a revolutionary situation, a chance to gain revenge for real and imagined grievances against the Republican governing elites, and the hope that the protective persona of Marshal Pétain would somehow enable France to avoid a draconian German peace. The National Revolution, however, unfolded under a German occupation whose confines became more constricting as the war progressed. In its four-year history it never experienced peacetime conditions. With the German occupation of the previously unoccupied southern zone, the scuttling of the French fleet, and the loss of the empire in 1942, Vichy lost even the independence it had previously had. The National Revolution became linked increasingly with a collaboration that meant German exploitation of France, including the deportation of Jews and other enemies of the Reich to extermination camps. It and the Vichy government disappeared with the 1944 liberation. The term “national revolution” preceded the 1940 defeat, appearing in 1924 as the title of a book by Georges Valois, leader of the pro-fascist Faisceau, and also in the political discourse of the interwar Jeunesses Patriotes, led by Pierre Taittinger. Although it came to designate Vichy’s agenda, the term was not favored by Pétain, who used it infrequently, preferring “<i>Redressement national</i>“ (national recovery) and “<i>Rénovation française</i>“ (French renewal) instead of the word “revolution.” <br><br>Given the many possibilities inherent in “mystique” and Pétain’s disinclination to enunciate specific doctrine, the National Revolution incorporated contradictions. Its framework, however, was clear. In addition to supporting the rule of the would-be providential leader, Pétain, it stood for a Catholic, if not clerical, moral and corporate order, based on “natural” hierarchical elites and opposed the parliamentary democracy and egalitarianism of the Third Republic. It promoted a strong state, yet at the same time a “revival” of provincial authority against the dominance of Paris. Comprising a retrospective nostalgia that idealized village artisans and rural peasants over the cosmopolitanism of Paris and the other large cities, it also, however, embraced the technocratic elites and administrative reformers—the Paris <i>métro </i>was reorganized in 1942—whose role was highlighted under Admiral Darlan and whose legacy carried into the Fifth Republic. <br><br>Under the National Revolution, communists and Freemasons were hunted down, and Jews were deported to the extermination camps. Although it attracted trade unionists, pacifists, and others from the interwar Left, the National Revolution was rooted in the history of the French Right, looking to the pre-1789 French Old Regime, authoritarian Bonapartism, the hierarchical quality of the “natural” bourgeois elites of the Orléanist period, the “moral order” of the government of Adolphe Thiers, which had crushed the Paris Commune of 1871, a variety of Catholic social corporatist theorists, the Action Française of Charles Maurras, and contemporary fascism. <br><br>The National Revolution made changes in symbols, replacing the trilogy “liberty, equality, fraternity” with “work, family, fatherland,” borrowed from Colonel François de La Rocque’s Parti Social Français, and de-emphasizing the 14 July Bastille Day holiday in favor of May Day, Mother’s Day, and festivals associated with Joan of Arc. Although shifting its center of gravity over time from the idealism of the “all things were possible” mood of July 1940 to the police repression of Joseph Darnand and the Milice Française in 1944, the National Revolution was characterized throughout its era by purges, for example, of the local administration during the fall of 1940, and repression of those groups seen as outside the national community. <br><br>Historians still debate the degree to which the National Revolution represented a French form of fascism. <br><br>R.

The Reich leaders did not anticipate positive French participation in the construction of a New Order. However, Vichy state collaborationism, predicated on a belief in German victory, had the goal of securing a place for France in the New Order, deliberately confusing this policy with its own National Revolution. Intimately associated with anticommunist ideology, the New Order was also the paradigm underlying Marcel Déat’s Rassemblement National Populaire, Jacques Doriot’s Parti Populaire Français, and the Légion des Volontaires Français contre le Bolchevisme. For intellectuals, such as Robert Brasillach, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, and Lucien Rebatet, the sense of France’s decadence rendered the ideal of a new Europe attractive, even if it meant collaboration with Nazi Germany. <br><br>Discrepancies between German perceptions and French illusions were evident as Vichy became more overtly a puppet regime. The Nazi New Order needs to be contrasted with more democratic ideals of European unity generated between the wars and developed within the Resistance. Controversy remains about whether Vichy ideas of European cooperation served the development of today’s European Union or whether the latter grew out of an explicit rejection of the wartime New Order.<br><br>Y.

Accompanied to Poland by a film crew and historical advisers Olga Wormser and Henri Michel, Resnais filmed color sequences on site at Auschwitz. Awarded the 1956 Jean Vigo Prize in recognition of Resnais’ independence of spirit and quality of direction, the film was screened at Cannes over protests by West German officials. Two months later, it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. <br><br>Black and white photographs of the camps taken in 1945 alternating with sequences from Nazi documentaries and color footage filmed a decade later helped Resnais extrapolate backward in time to bear witness to deeds of unimaginable cruelty. Images of barbed-wire fences, crematory ovens, and mountains of discarded boots conveyed grim evidence of the Holocaust, whose reality many preferred to deny. The film’s visual impact was enhanced by Michel Bouquet’s haunting voice-over and by the “terrifying sweetness” (François Truffaut) of Hanns Eisler’s musical score.

Oriented by family background and education toward the aristocratic Right, the young Nimier, however, during the Occupation looked more to General de Gaulle than to the Maurrasians of Vichy for political inspiration. The purge that followed the Liberation, especially de Gaulle’s refusal to reprieve the collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach, who was executed in February 1945, turned Nimier toward the oppositional Right. In March 1945, he joined the army’s Second Hussars (Hussards), but the war ended while he was still training in France, and he was demobilized in August. By late 1945, he had become active in right-wing monarchist politics and anti-<i>résistantialiste </i>literary circles. Disillusioned in his hope that de Gaulle would prevent what he saw as the reemergence of mediocrity in the early days of the Fourth Republic, Nimier turned his literary attention to the ex-<i>Résistant </i>writer Georges Bernanos, whom he perceived as a model of refusal to compromise with the pettiness of the new regime and who had just died in 1948. Nimier’s <i>Le Grand d’Espagne </i>(1950) was an apotheosis of Bernanos as a noble Spanish grandee representing the opposite of <i>résistantialiste </i>hypocrisy. <br><br>Two novels, <i>Les Épées </i>(1948) and <i>Le Hussard bleu </i>(1950), made Nimier’s reputation as one of France’s premier Second World War novelists. In both novels, Nimier evoked the sincerity of ardent collaborators and resisters as preferable to those who had hypocritically evaded choices or remained in the middle. By relativizing the collaboration/resistance dichotomy, Nimier represented the choices of right-wing, bourgeois young Frenchmen of the immediate postwar era against the dominant directions of Sartrian existentialism.

With the coming of war in September 1939 General Noguès commanded the North African Theater of Operations, headquartered at Algiers. After French reverses in Europe in May 1940, he counseled the government to continue the fight against Germany from North Africa. His telegrams still make stirring reading. Ultimately, however, he obeyed the orders to lay down his arms and accept the armistice with Germany; Noguès was given the assurance that no portion of France’s territory in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) would be ceded to Germany, Italy, or Spain. During his tenure under Vichy, Noguès followed the lead of General Maxime Weygand, Pétain’s delegate in French Africa, who was convinced that the armistice had saved France from destruction and preserved the unity of its army and empire. Like Weygand, Noguès was determined to keep Morocco out of the war and securely in Vichy hands. An unenthusiastic supporter of Vichy’s collaboration policy, he secretly stockpiled weapons and trained Moroccan troops in the Atlas mountains for the day when Germany “would break its promises.” <br><br>When the Americans landed in Morocco in November 1942, Noguès met them with all the firepower he possessed, persuaded that only resistance to all comers would preserve France’s increasingly fragile hold over Morocco.

Operation Torch was planned as the first step toward the liberation of the European mainland. <br><br>The American hope was to persuade French commanders not to resist the landings but to greet the invaders as allies and join them in a crusade to liberate France. American agents did recruit key French soldiers to aid their cause (notably, Generals Henri Giraud, Émile Béthouart, and Charles Mast), but ultimately they were unable to break the Vichy chain of command that linked North Africa to Marshal Pétain.

Still, in three days of fighting the French inflicted 1,500 casualties on the Anglo-American forces. In addition, the delay in Morocco and Algeria prevented a quick move into Tunisia, where the Germans—with Vichy approval—had rushed troops to block any Allied advance. In the end, U.S. General Mark W.

The OCM looked to a future postwar France with economic planning, the reinforcement of the executive power, and the election of the president by universal suffrage. <br><br>An original aspect of the OCM was the creation of a youth affiliate, the OCMJ (OCM-Jeunesse) in July 1943.

Within a few days of the 1940 defeat a preliminary list, the <i>“liste Bernhard” </i>proscribed 13 titles. Over the next three months, the German Propaganda Abteilung (Propaganda Department) worked to establish a more comprehensive listing, which it drew up in consultation with the French publishers’ association, the Syndicat des éditeurs français et des maisons d’édition. The resulting list of 1,060 titles was published in September 1940 and became known as the “<i>liste Otto</i>.” This was the authoritative listing of banned books to which a set of additional titles was added in July 1941, with further amendments in July 1942 and May 1943. The lists aimed to ban anti-German, antifascist, and oppositional writings, works by Jewish authors, and all Marxist or communist material. Many translations of British and American books, other than recognized literary classics, were banned. Later versions of the list banned Russian and Polish books and biographies of Jews. A substantial number of schoolbooks were also included. The publishers most affected were Gallimard (140 titles banned), Fayard (110), Presses Universitaires de France (101), and Tallandier (51). Gallimard’s partly Jewish ownership also led to its closure for three weeks in November 1940. The immediate consequence of the lists was the seizure and destruction of more than 700,000 books in bookshops on 3 September 1940, followed a week later by an agreement on censorship with the publishers, who were obliged to destroy a further 8,000 books and to pulp several tons of paper. Despite their incompleteness and their incoherence, the Otto lists were symbolically the iron fist of the Propaganda Abteilung, which generally preferred to manage French opinion with a velvet glove. <br><br>J.-P.

Prepared for an exceptional administrative career by the prestigious <i>lycée </i>Louis-le-Grand in Paris and by university degrees in law and political science, Papon began by holding several positions under the direction of Radical Socialist officials of the Third Republic from July 1935 to the end of August 1939.

In this capacity, given both the power to sign for the regional prefect Sabatier as well as the primary responsibility for relations with the Nazi occupants, Papon, according to Gérard Boulanger, functioned as the real technician of the deportations from the Bordeaux region, keeping records of Jews, supplying lists of those to be deported, planning and carrying out police raids, and organizing transfers to Drancy, from where almost all were to be deported to Auschwitz.

Nonetheless, although Marshal Pétain remained in Vichy, many of the government services eventually returned to Paris even during the Occupation. <br><br>With the outbreak of war in September 1939, Paris began to take on a wartime aspect, blacked out at night, with many of its official and historic buildings protected by sandbags. Tens of thousands of Parisians fled the German advance in June 1940. Upon entering Paris, the Germans found it a ghost town. With the June 1940 armistice, however, the Germans and many of the French wanted to give Paris the appearance of peacetime normalcy. Encouraged by the Germans, refugees returned, nightclubs reopened, and the city resumed much of its cultural activity of prewar days. Cinema and theater flourished—plays by Jean- Paul Sartre, among others, were performed. Nightclubs featured stars such as Maurice Chevalier. Pro-Axis literary and journalistic circles, exemplified by Lucien Rebatet and Jean Luchaire, respectively, flourished, more so in occuPARIS, pied Paris than in provincial Vichy, even though Vichy remained unoccupied by the Germans until 1942. The collaborationist Parti Populaire Français and Rassemblement National Populaire also had their bases in Paris. Despite—or, in a way, because of—a Nazi view of Paris as a corrupt “Babylon,” the Germans used occupied Paris as a rest and rehabilitation center for their troops, and postings there were highly prized. Hitler visited the city as a tourist shortly after it was occupied, and German troops paraded regularly down the Champs Élysées to the tunes of military marches. Germans were allowed to ride free on the <i>métro, </i>and designated cinemas, nightclubs, and restaurants were reserved exclusively for them. A biweekly tourist guide, published in German, was made available to the occupation forces, thousands of whom were given tours of the city by a unit of the Wehrmacht created for that purpose. Parisian museums were looted to enrich the private art collections of Hermann Göring and other German officials. <br><br>While life for the Germans and their allies in occupied Paris was good, most of the French civilians suffered under drastically reduced rations. Many had to seek food from friends and relatives in the countryside. Civilians were sometimes killed accidentally in Allied bombing runs, especially during the latter stages of the Occupation. Parisian Jews often suffered the loss of their homes and businesses, many were eventually deported to extermination camps, while others went into hiding. An anti-German student demonstration on Armistice Day, 11 November 1940, led to dozens of arrests and was not repeated. Paris was spared destruction twice, in June 1940, when it was declared an open city by the French and occupied without resistance, and in August 1944, when the German garrison commander Dietrich von Choltitz disobeyed Hitler’s order to destroy the city rather than abandon it to the French. With the liberation of Paris, General de Gaulle headed a victory parade down the ChampsÉlysées, then consecrated the victory at Notre Dame Cathedral. Once again, Paris resumed its flourishing cultural activities and night life—English-language guidebooks replaced the German ones—but with France now mobilizing to participate in the final defeat of the Axis, it took several more years for most Parisians to recover from the privations of war and Occupation. <br><br>*†L.

He believed that the right-wing leagues had not truly attempted to overthrow the Republic during their march on the Chamber of Deputies in February 1934. The following April, he created the Parti Français National Communiste. Staunchly anti-Semitic, Clémenti spent 92 days in prison for anti-Semitic and racial defamation in 1939. Competing with former communist Jacques Doriot and the Parti Populaire Français (PPF) for a similar proletarian clientele after 1936, the PFNC depicted Doriot as “sold out to the Jews and manipulated by the capitalists.” <br><br>Demobilized in Paris, while most of his rivals were in Vichy immediately after the 1940 armistice, Clémenti refloated his party, with headquarters on the Champs Élysées. The name “Communist” in his group, however, was supplanted by “Collectiviste” at the insistence of the Germans. Attacks against youth hostel quarters and rampages along the Champs Élysées in August 1940 in which windows of Jewish-owned shops were smashed by the Gardes Franc ¸aises, affiliated with the PFNC, got the movement into trouble with the German police. The PFNC never made much headway in its competition with the larger and better-organized PPF, and internecine quarrels drove most of its supporters away. Clémenti, however, was one of the few collaborationist leaders who actually served in the anti-Bolshevik Légion des Volontaires Français. He was the only collaborationist spokesman to demand the French annexation of the Francophone territories of Belgium, placing him in direct conflict with Belgian Rexist leader Léon Degrelle. Condemned in 1954 for his wartime political activity, Clémenti continued to be active in small parties, such as Ordre Nouveau (not to be confused with the pre–World War II movement of the same name; see Ordre Nouveau), until his death in 1982. <br><br>B.

PPF leaders described the Communist Party as the “party of the foreigner” behind the Popular Front, promoting social disintegration and war.

Vichy helped fund the party, but Doriot’s rapport with Pétain was distant, and the PPF never had a strong presence at Vichy. It quickly became one of the main “ultra,” or extremist, parties in Paris.

However, he carried on with his activities as the editor of the Pléiade series for Gallimard, a position that allowed him to gather information for the Resistance. In January 1941, he became one of the editors of <i>Résistance</i>, a clandestine journal published by the group Musée de l’homme. When the network was infiltrated and destroyed in May 1941, printing materials were found in Paulhan’s apartment, and he was arrested but later released, thanks to Drieu la Rochelle. Paulhan continued his Resistance work and helped Jacques Decour to found the <i>Lettres Françaises</i>, as well as being instrumental in the creation of the clandestine publishing house the Éditions de minuit. Throughout the Occupation, Paulhan published in legally produced journals in the provinces and abroad that supported the Resistance, and his prose appeared in <i>Commoedia, Confluences</i>, and Pierre Seghers’ <i>Poésie </i>series. He also wrote articles for clandestine publications, including his “Éloge du Jacques Decour,” which appeared in <i>Chroniques interdites </i>(Éditions de minuit, 1943), and a short prose poem, “L’Abeille,” published in <i>Cahiers de la libération </i>in February 1944. <br><br>Paulhan’s perceived lack of commitment to a set political agenda and his opposition to <i>résistantialisme </i>led to an angry exchange with members of the Resistance, most notably, Vercors (Jean Bruller), at the end of the war, when he expressed his disapproval of the postwar trials in <i>Lettre aux membres du Comité national des écrivains </i>(1947) and <i>Lettre aux directeurs de la Résistance </i>(1952). <br><br>F.

Consisting of nearly half the French population, the rural people were simultaneously envied and extolled but were miserable during the Occupation. <br><br>They were envied, as food was scarce, and urban dwellers saw that people in the countryside ate better. Farmers were courted and asked to give a few kilos of potatoes, some milk, or a bit of meat. An old farmer later remembered, “At the time we were considered good folk.” <br><br>They were extolled by the regime, which made the agrarian image a key piece in the National Revolution. Marshal Pétain himself, on 25 June 1940, spoke of the “soil that does not lie. . . . A field that falls fallow is a part of France that dies. A fallow field that is again re-sown is a part of France reborn.” His exaltation of the soil and the peasant family was echoed often by the regime. Peasants were in a pitiable condition because of shortages of men and material necessary for agricultural production. One million three hundred thousand farm ers had been mobilized, 55,000 killed, and 500,000 taken prisoner in 1940. Some returned, but in 1944 approximately 400,000 of the best men were still unavailable for agriculture. Means of production were lacking. For example, there were 1,321 tractors in 1938 and only 348 in 1944, in extremely bad condition. Fuel, manure, and the straw twine so well known in the countryside were also lacking. In addition, the Germans took large quantities, estimated at least at 10 percent, of available resources, especially significant coming from a production already reduced by 22 percent. In short, a damaged peasantry hid its wounds under the praises of the regime. <br><br>*†P. Barral, <i>Les Agrariens français de Méline à Pisani </i>(Paris, 1968); M.

Praised by his defenders as the savior and protector of his country in its time of troubles, Pétain has been portrayed in most recent historical scholarship as the leader of a collaborationist, authoritarian regime that oppressed its own population while facilitating the German war effort. <br><br>After distinguishing himself in the Battle of Verdun and in handling French army mutinies during the First World War, Pétain became in the 1920s his country’s staunchest proponent of the defensive military strategy that prompted the construction of the Maginot Line at the end of the decade. Amid the turbulence of the 1930s, elements of the reactionary Right hailed Pétain, who had retired from active service in 1932, as a providential “man on horseback” who would restore social order and overthrow the hated Republic.<br><br>As German mechanized divisions drove deep into northern France in May 1940, French premier Paul Reynaud, seeking to broaden the appeal of his government, appointed the popular Pétain vice-premier. On 16 June, two days after German military forces occupied Paris, Pétain replaced Reynaud as prime minister with the mandate to open truce negotiations with Germany. The Franco– German armistice signed on 22 June partitioned the country into a northern zone occupied by the German army and a southern zone to be administered by Pétain’s government, which reassembled in the spa town of Vichy. On 9–10 July the French parliament voted full powers to Pétain, who proceeded to replace the parliamentary system of the Third Republic with an authoritarian regime dominated by reactionaries committed to the restoration of religious, patriotic, and family values. A cult of hero worship developed around the octogenarian military leader, who promised to protect France from the ravages of war, salvage something of the country’s honor, and preserve for it a privileged position in a Nazi-dominated Europe. <br><br>Pétain was under constant pressure from Pierre Laval and French fascist ideologues in Paris to collaborate more closely with Germany. He attempted to preserve a modicum of French independence by denying the Germans access to the French fleet based at the Mediterranean port of Toulon and then ordering its destruction when German military forces, following the Allied landings in North Africa, had invaded the unoccupied zone, preparing to seize the fleet in November 1942. On the other hand, his regime furnished raw materials, manufactured goods, and labor to the German war machine and fully complied with Nazi requests for the delivery of Jews for transfer to the concentration camps of the Third Reich. The German military occupation of the southern zone and Pétain’s naming of Laval as his successor with the power to issue decrees in November 1942 removed the last vestige of the marshal’s independent authority. In August 1944, as the Allied armies advanced south and east after their landings in Normandy, the Germans forcibly transferred the 88-year-old figurehead leader from Vichy to the old Hohenzollern castle of Sigmaringen. After the war, Pétain was tried, convicted of treason, and sentenced to death by a French tribunal. In deference to his advanced age the postwar French government commuted the sentence to life imprisonment on the Île d’Yeu off France’s Atlantic coast, where he died at 95 in 1951. <br><br>*M.

Hopes were high among those who wanted Tunisia held for Vichy and those Germans who wished to see a major commitment from France to the Axis cause. Recruiting took place among the troops of the Légion Tricolor, in process of dissolution at the time, and within the European community in Tunisia. Without warning, however, the Germans blocked the sailing of a contingent of volunteers from the metropole. <br><br>On 28 December, a German airplane brought over six officers, quickly promoted for the occasion: Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Cristofini and Captains Daniel Peltier and Roger Euzière, active officers; and, from the reserves, the aviator Lieutenant Colonel Christian Sarton du Jonchay, Battalion Chief Henri Curnier, and Sublieutenant Henri Charbonneau. German opposition, however, prevented the departure of any additional volunteers from continental France. <br><br>On 8 March 1943, a local revolutionary committee in Tunis, supported by Vichy’s resident-general Admiral Jean-Pierre Esteva, was able to enlist a company of some 210 local men, to be trained by German officers. Ten days later, this group, the Phalange, took oaths to Hitler, and on 9 April the company was sent into battle against British forces at Klioua, some 50 kilometers from Tunis. By 20 April, following a British offensive, the Phalange was relieved, only 64 of its volunteers still combat-ready. With the Allied victory in North Africa, the Phalange was dissolved on 6 May, its members given three months’ pay to see them through to better times.

Remaining in France during the German occupation, Picasso was prohibited from exhibiting his work publicly due to Franco’s influence on Vichy, but he sold and exchanged some paintings privately. <br><br>Picasso moved to Paris permanently in 1904 and became a major figure in the development of cubism. A supporter of the Republic during the civil war in Spain, he made a statement against “brutality and darkness” in his mural depicting the German destruction of the town of Guernica in 1937. The next year, his work was declared “decadent” by the Nazi government. <br><br>At the beginning of the war, Picasso divided his time between Paris and Royan, with companion Dora Maar and friend and secretary Jaime Sabartès, declining offers to emigrate to America or Mexico. In August 1940, he left Royan and remained in Paris for the duration of the war. He was denounced by Nazi as well as Vichy sympathizers, for example, by former friend Maurice de Vlaminck, in <i>Comoedia</i>, 6 June 1942. Several of his paintings, together with others judged by the Nazis as not even worth selling, were burned on 27 July 1943 in the Tuileries garden. In constant danger during the Occupation, Picasso was harassed by visits of Gestapo officers, witnessed on some occasions by Françoise Gilot, Picasso’s future companion, whom he had met in May 1943. During one visit, German officers slashed several paintings and called Picasso “degenerate.” Those who protected him include German sculptor Arno Breker, poet Jean Cocteau, and former French government official André-Louis Dubois. In September 1943, Maurice Toesca, a prefect of the French police, illegally made Picasso a new foreign resident identification card, extending his stay in France. Picasso’s output during the Occupation included several hundred paintings, as well as sculpture and graphic works. While he joined no Resistance movements, he assisted Spanish Republican refugees. He helped friends, such as Henri Matisse, whose private bank vault he administered, thereby protecting valuable artworks from German seizure. <br><br>Shortly after the liberation, Picasso was named chairman of a committee of the Front National des Arts that identified artist and critic collaborators for the purge. He also claimed to have joined the French Communist Party, which led to a violent anti-Picasso demonstration at the Salon de la Libération, where he was the only artist given a gallery of his own, exhibiting about 80 of his works.

Many newspapers came to be the organ of an eponymous movement, as with <i>Franc-Tireur, Libération, </i>or <i>Défense de la France, </i>providing both a channel of communication and an identity. The Communist and Socialist Parties each published a series of papers: the Communist <i>L’Humanité </i>appeared clandestinely from October 1939 and therefore had well-organized systems in place before the defeat, while the Socialist <i>Le Populaire </i>reappeared in mid-1942. Both papers had numerous regional editions and offshoots. The intellectual Resistance also produced a range of underground journals. <br><br>The most influential of these was the <i>Lettres Françaises, </i>a broad literary and artistic review, but there were important magazines on film, theater, music, philosophy, painting, poetry, and other specialty areas. Several professional groupings produced clandestine papers, many of them sponsored by wider movements, notably the Front National. In this way teachers, farmers, academics, doctors, lawyers, students, the police, and other groups eventually had their own Resistance forum. Trade unions published clandestine papers, including 230 issues of the Confédération Générale du Travail’s La Vie ouvrière. Religious groups also participated, despite the Catholic Church’s generally pro-Vichy stance, which the Témoignage chrétien group was particularly prominent in opposing. <br><br>The aims of the clandestine press were to circulate opinions and information not available in the officially permitted media, which were heavily controlled and censored. Based initially on the call to resist and the criticism of collaboration, they called on patriotic pride and a national tradition of fierce independence. As their organization improved, the clandestine papers offered a broader and more sophisticated content, approaching the status of an alternative press, with a mission to provide unfettered reporting and comment. In the later stages of the war, they turned increasingly to consideration of the policies and structures that would be required after liberation, an aspiration expressed in the later subtitle of <i>Combat</i>: “From Resistance to Revolution.” <br><br>News reporting drew on radio broadcasts from London, Moscow, Switzerland, and elsewhere, as well as networks of correspondents. Press bureau facilities were established, some vigorously supported by the Free French in London and Algiers, though others avoided too close a political dependency on General de Gaulle.<br><br>Production and distribution posed significant material problems. Early publications were achieved through artisanal methods, but the larger-scale operations depended on access to commercial printing facilities and large quantities of paper and ink, which were closely rationed. These were secured by an astonishing variety of solutions, combining ingenuity and heroism, for which many people gave their lives. Distribution posed comparable problems. Workers on road and rail networks secured the transport of large quantities of clandestine papers, which were circulated surreptitiously by teams of delivery workers, all at great risk to their lives. <br><br>Many clandestine papers and magazines continued publication openly after the liberation, though few survived the political collapse of the Resistance structures and the inhospitable economic conditions of the late 1940s.<br><br>C.

It distinguished itself from the interwar right-wing press as well as from the Pétainist Vichy press of the occupied zone in its support for Hitler’s New Order and its impatience with Vichy traditionalism. <br><br>The defeat of May–June 1940 brought significant and immediate changes to the Parisian press. Major interwar left-wing reviews such as <i>Marianne </i>simply disappeared, while many of the conservative right-wing Maurasian reviews, including <i>Candide </i>and <i>Gringoire</i>, moved to the unoccupied zone and adopted a Pétainist line. Relations between this pro-Vichy press and the pro-German press in Paris were unfriendly from the outset and remained that way throughout the Occupation. <br><br>Of some 40 daily and weekly newspapers and magazines published in occupied Paris, only six were holdovers from the interwar period. These included four dailies, <i>Le Matin, Paris-Soir, L’OEuvre</i>, and <i>Le Petit Parisien</i>, and two weeklies, <i>L’Illustration </i>and <i>Je Suis Partout</i>. Among the dailies, all took a strongly collaborationist and, indeed, pro-Nazi and pro-fascist line. The editor of <i>Le Matin</i>, Jacques Ménard, signed his letters “<i>Heil Hitler!</i>“ while the editor of <i>Le Petit Parisien</i>, Claude Jeantet, transformed his paper into the mouthpiece for the French fascist Jacques Doriot and his Parti Populaire Français. <i>L’OEuvre</i>, on the other hand, supported the erstwhile socialist and now fascist leader Marcel Déat and his Rassemblement National Populaire following its creation in 1941. Of the holdover weeklies, <i>Je Suis Partout </i>would achieve the greatest notoriety both because of the star status of its editors and writers, including Robert Brasillach and Lucien Rebatet, and because of the virulence of its pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic views. <br><br>Among the newly created dailies, the best known was Jean Luchaire’s <i>Les Nouveaux Temps</i>, launched with German money. Luchaire, a close personal friend of the German ambassador, Otto Abetz, also became head of the Paris Press Corporation and, like Brasillach, would be tried and executed during the purge following the liberation.<br><br>Another high-profile periodical created with German money was Alphonse de Châteaubriant’s weekly literary and cultural review, <i>La Gerbe</i>. Attracting wellknown writers, including Jean Giono, Henry de Montherlant, Marcel Aymé, and Colette, <i>La Gerbe </i>sought to convey the impression that French culture was continuing as usual even under Nazi rule. Pro-German (Châteaubriant had been a fervent admirer of Hitler before the war) in its politics, <i>La Gerbe </i>also backed Vichy, the result being a bizarre ideological mix that one of its editors, Lucien Combelle, referred to as “<i>Hitlero-Pétainisme</i>.” Political contributors to its pages included the likes of Fernand de Brinon, Vichy’s “ambassador” to the occupied zone who was also executed after the liberation. <br><br>Other, smaller, and more ephemeral dailies and weeklies included the “leftwing” <i>Le Rouge et le Bleu</i>, edited by the former socialist Charles Spinasse, a minister under Léon Blum, and the virulently anti-Semitic <i>Au Pilori</i>, modeled after Germany’s <i>Der Stürmer</i>.

German control was stronger in the occupied zone, where 60 percent of the prewar press disappeared after the invasion. <br><br>Only 32 percent disappeared in the unoccupied zone, where several Paris publications took refuge, though their relationship with the Vichy government was difficult as they tried to preserve their autonomy. Because of paper restrictions, most publications consisted of only a few pages. Transportation problems also made their diffusion difficult. In addition, Vichy kept newspapers criticizing Marshal Pétain in the occupied zone out of the unoccupied zone. The press under Vichy was organized by the Office français d’information, which scrutinized articles and photographs submitted from local, regional, and foreign correspondents. It supported Vichy in pressuring newspapers to publish favorable commentaries on the government, especially in the first months of the Occupation. Censorship tightened when the Germans took over the previously unoccupied zone in November 1942. <br><br>In appearances the press did not change much from what it had been before the war. Many newspapers kept the same name and format, and their directors remained French. Yet, only those clearly sympathetic to the Germans and Vichy maintained their positions. Only publications that complied with both Vichy and the Germans remained active. New publications were created in order to reach the entire population, especially groups seen as necessary for national reconstruction, such as farmers, youth, prisoners of war, and women, who had to work in the absence of men. <br><br>Vichy used the press to propagate its idea of a National Revolution. It glorified Petain’s idea of a new moral order based on clerical, national, and familial values and strongly criticized the indignity and material consequences of the defeat, which it attributed to an alleged prewar economic and social chaos. The press also supported Franco–German collaboration. Additional political themes after 1941 included the Bolshevik peril and hostility to the United States. The general rule was to create apparent unanimity among the newspapers, to avoid both alarming the French population and provoking reactions from the Germans. Food and other material restrictions were portrayed as temporary and necessary for reconstruction. References to the occupying forces were kept to a minimum in order to suggest Vichy’s autonomy. Because the political goals and rhetorical devices of the press were so obvious, it had only a minor effect on the bulk of the population. It mostly served to reinforce the beliefs of the collaborationists. <br><br>*†P. Albert, <i>Histoire de la presse </i>(Paris, 1990); C.

The prisoners represented 4 percent of France’s population, or one in seven men between ages 20 and 40. Over half were married, many with children. Nearly half the prisoners were taken between Pétain’s 17 June statement that “the fighting must cease” and the armistice, effective 25 June. The Germans transferred 1.58 million of the prisoners from France to Germany, where they were put to work to mitigate labor shortages in agriculture and industry. Among them, 71,000 escaped, and 24,600 died in captivity. Of the 940,000 French prisoners remaining in Germany in 1945, most were repatriated between April and June. <br><br>The prisoners were a constant issue in Franco–German negotiations, a justification for Vichy’s existence. The 1929 Geneva Convention governed their treatment, yet in November 1940 Vichy accepted Germany’s proposal and replaced the United States, which had been appointed neutral “protecting power,” with a Service diplomatique des prisonniers de guerre, led by Georges Scapini, a blinded war veteran, which inspected prison camps for compliance with the convention and disseminated Vichy propaganda. <br><br>Vichy obtained the release of groups such as World War I veterans and the 90,747 repatriated under the <i>Relève</i>. In France, the repatriated prisoner Maurice Pinot created the Commissariat général des prisonniers de guerre répatriés (CGPGR) in 1941, a public agency to assist repatriated prisoners and their families. Initially many were pro-Pétain but they became increasingly disillusioned as time went on. Resistance networks started in the camps and continued in the repatriated POW community in France. Eventually, the Mouvement National des Prisonniers de Guerre et Déportés united a communist group, a Gaullist group, and a group led by Pinot and François Mitterrand, both of whom left the CGPGR when the collaborationist André Masson took over. After the war, former prisoners often felt that they carried the stigma of the 1940 defeat and that French society dismissed their service and hardships. <br><br>Y.

Prisoners’ wives represented a significant cross-section of the female population, and about 40 percent had children. Vichy considered itself responsible for them and paid military allowances to soldiers’ wives who demonstrated need. The state also attempted to prevent adultery, passing a law 23 December 1942 punishing adultery with the spouse of a person “absent from his country because of circumstances of war.” The Commissariat général des prisonniers de guerre répatriés, initially created by and for repatriated prisoners, extended its concern to their families, where it collided with Madame Charles-Léon Huntziger’s agency, La famille du prisonnier, which wanted to be protector of POW families. Prisoners’ wives faced the difficulties of shortages, inflation, taking over family farms or businesses, working for wages, and raising children alone. Their politics spanned the range from Pétainism to Resistance. Many Jewish prisoners’ wives were deported to concentration camps, suffering the same fate as their coreligionists and a fate worse than their husbands’. <br><br>Prisoners’ wives created support groups, of which the largest, the Fédération des associations de femmes de prisonniers, or FAFP, was built on local grassroots activism usually initiated by women, such as FAFP president Andrée Aulas. In addition to mutual support, social events, and lobbying, the FAFP published a monthly, <i>Femmes de Prisonniers </i>(Wives of Prisoners), and commissioned a novel, <i>La Guerre des Captives </i>(Captives’ War) and a survey, <i>Femmes d’Absents . . . Témoignages </i>(Wives of the Missing . . . Testimonies). Reunion went smoothly for many couples. Although some couples faced problems, only about 10 percent divorced.

This move was mirrored by Germans, who transferred control of their prisons in both zones from their Wehrmacht to the Waffen-SS. Gabolde shared much of his power with Joseph Darnand, head of the Vichy police beginning in December of 1943 and leader of Vichy’s militia (Milice Française).

The community had been divided since the late nineteenth century between evangelicals and liberals, Lutherans and Calvinists, and, during the interwar years, the politically progressive Social Christians and apolitical followers of Karl Barth. A fragile reunification was achieved in 1938 with the creation of the Reformed Church of France. Though most Protestants were liberal and Republican, extremes on the Left included pacifist groups, while on the Right the Sully Association grouped royalist and anti-Semitic Protestants. <br><br>With the advent of Vichy, most French Protestants supported Marshal Pétain. Though there was some fear concerning the clerical appearance of the regime, Protestants were quickly reassured. The government included Protestants René Gillouin (speechwriter and adviser to Pétain), General Charles Brécard (grand chancellor of the Légion d’honneur), Gaston Bruneton (commissioner of French manpower in Germany), and Admiral Charles Platon (colonial secretary of state). Marc Boegner, the leader of the French Protestant community, served on Vichy’s Conseil national. <br><br>Protestants, however, were increasingly troubled by the oath of loyalty to Pétain and the anti-Masonic and anti-Semitic legislation (especially the second “<i>Statut des Juifs</i>“ in June 1941). In the Midi and particularly the Cévennes, mistrust grew between Protestants and Catholics, while in Paris, André-Numa Bertrand, vice president of the Fédération protestante de France, openly criticized the regime. Protestant Resistance was rooted in their historical experience of persecution in France, the theological emphasis upon the individual conscience, the primacy of the Hebrew Testament, and the translated articles of the German Protestant thinker Karl Barth, who called for resistance to the Nazis. <br><br>In September 1941, 16 Protestant pastors, theologians, and laypersons meeting in Pomeyrol issued the “Eight Theses of Pomeyrol,” a clandestine text that underscored the limits of obedience to the state and the inviolability of individual liberties and condemned Vichy’s anti-Semitic legislation and collaboration with Nazi Germany. Following the roundup of foreign-born Jews in mid-1942, many Protestants, according to a police report from Nîmes, assumed “a veritable fighting position.” Official letters of protest from the Protestant Federation to Pétain and Pierre Laval heralded, in September 1942, the annual Protestant gathering at the Musée du Désert in southern France. There, Boegner instructed his pastors to save the lives of Jewish refugees—a move already anticipated by numerous Protestant groups and individuals—and to read from their pulpits an official message exhorting their parishioners “to show the compassion of the Good Samaritan for the distress of those who suffer.” The calls to Christian conscience were reflected in the activity of largely Protestant refugee and rescue groups such as Cimade and instances of mass civil disobedience, as in Chambon-sur- Lignon and many Cévenol villages. <br><br>*P.

German officials rebuffed such hints until mid-May, when the conjunction of a major anti-British revolt in Iraq, General Erwin Rommel’s advances in North Africa, and successive Wehrmacht victories in Yugoslavia, mainland Greece, and Crete heightened German interest in installations around the Mediterranean littoral. On 20 May General Walther Warlimont of the German General Staff traveled to Paris to discuss terms under which the Luftwaffe could transfer matériel to Iraq through the airfields at Aleppo and Palmyra in Syria, and the Kriegsmarine could supply the Afrika Korps through the Tunisian port of Bizerte. <br><br>Vichy officials hastily granted permission to use these facilities, offered French warships as escorts for German convoys in the Mediterranean, and suggested that a submarine base be built at Dakar in Senegal. In return, Berlin promised to release French prisoners of war who were veterans of the First World War, facilitate movement across the Demarcation Line, and lower exactions levied to offset the costs of the Occupation. Vichy envisaged the protocols, signed on 28 May 1941, as the prelude to a comprehensive peace treaty that might enable France to take what Admiral Darlan called “her honorable place” in a German-dominated New Order. Berlin took a dimmer view of Franco–German strategic partnership, particularly after British troops crushed the revolt in Iraq and occupied Syria. Nevertheless, Darlan demanded that the 1940 armistice be overturned before German transports be allowed to dock at Bizerte.

The first Allied bombing attacks began on 28 April 1944 and intensified throughout the summer until the actual invasion in August.

At the liberation, the GPRF established itself as the sole legitimate government in France. It enjoyed virtually unlimited power until the first postwar general elections of October 1945 and the subsequent establishment of a Constituent Assembly. Thereafter, its authority was placed on a more regular democratic footing, although it continued to operate as the executive until the inauguration of the first government of the Fourth Republic in January 1947. <br><br>The GPRF’s origins lay in the formative stages of de Gaulle’s Free France movement. As early as 1940–1941 Free France took on certain aspects of a provisional government, with a cabinet (initially termed the Conseil de défense de l’empire and later the Comité national français) and a number of embryonic ministries (termed <i>commissariats</i>). In 1943, after the Allied liberation of French North Africa, de Gaulle transferred this skeletal government to Algiers, integrated it with the organization of General Henri Giraud, and thereby created the CFLN, which was widely recognized to represent all Resistance forces inside and outside France (although the United States and Britain refused to recognize it as the French government). Three days before D-Day, to advance its claim to governmental status, the CFLN transformed itself into the GPRF. <br><br>Over the course of the next two and a half years, this government, which brought together representatives from a wide range of political groupings, including the Communist Party, saw the country through a transitional period of great turmoil and complexity. In the aftermath of the liberation, it fended off Anglo-American plans for an Allied Military Government and thwarted both last-minute Vichyite plots and revolutionary impulses from the grassroots Resistance. Then, with its own authority consolidated—and finally recognized by the other Allied governments—the GPRF had to deal with the difficult legacies of the Occupation: punishing those who had collaborated with Germany, rebuilding a devastated economy, repatriating prisoners of war and deportees, restoring democratic institutions, and reasserting French influence and interests abroad. Such immediate concerns claimed most of the GPRF’s attention in late 1944 and early 1945, and the government’s responses prompted much public criticism (perhaps inevitably so). <br><br>After mid-1945 the GPRF increasingly switched its attention to the issue of postwar reconstruction. There, it capitalized on the relative absence of institutional or constitutional constraints to carry through an ambitious reform agenda. By the end of 1946 it had established a system of national economic planning; nationalized coal, electricity, gas, the largest clearing banks and insurance companies; renovated and expanded social welfare provisions; and created theÉcole nationale d’administration. Even though the parallel movement for constitutional renewal ended in a disappointing failure (the Fourth Republic resembling in most respects the Third), the reformist achievements of the Provisional Government were substantial and contributed to the successful reconstruction of France in the postwar decades. <br><br>J.

The Germans did not attempt to appropriate all French publishing houses but relied instead on the industry’s policing itself and centralized control over paper distribution to keep the French publishers in line. <br><br>A program of Aryanization of Jewish-owned publishing houses, such as Nathan, Calmann Lévy, and Ferenczi, was set up, and these establishments were placed in the hands of “French” managers, some of whom were sympathetic toward the former Jewish owners. In some rare cases, such as those of Sorlot and Cluny the German authorities seized the financial holdings of publishers for a period. Hachette is an example of the difficulties the Germans faced when wishing to take more direct control. After taking control, the Germans were forced to negotiate who should be in charge with Hachette’s managing director, René Schoeller, when he returned to Paris from the 1940 exodus. Ultimately, a German-sponsored management ran Hachette for the duration of the Occupation. In general, however, the Germans preferred to maintain a more discrete presence rather than assume control of publishing houses. <br><br>Most publishers who returned to Paris after 1940 accepted the ambiguities of the period and accommodated German demands in order to receive their paper allowance. Bernard Grasset worked with a German associate and socialized with the occupation army officers; Robert Denoe¨l, after reestablishing control over his company, worked with a German accountant and published writers as diverse as Louis-Ferdinand Céline and Elsa Triolet. He also headed Les nouvelles éditions françaises, publishing anti-Semitic material, which made him a target for reprisals after the liberation.<br><br>Publishers in the provinces continued their activities, with new players entering the game, such as Robert Laffont, based in Marseilles until 1944. German control and censorship were less oppressive in the southern zone, giving publishing houses based there more freedom, especially early in the war. So-called contraband literature entered circulation, for example, some texts produced legally that passed the censor but had an ambiguous Resistance message. Although some writers refused to publish at all, such as Joseph Kessel, others, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Robert Desnos, used the wide margin for ambiguity to continue writing for publication. In terms of clandestine publishing, the Éditions de minuit, set up by Vercors (Jean Bruller) and others in 1942, stands out as a venture considered by many to have embodied the spirit of the Resistance. French publishing developed abroad as well, particularly in Switzerland, where Les trois collines and Les cahiers du Rhine published work by French writers. New York was also a haven for writers and publishers in exile with the creation of Les éditions de la maison française. <br><br>At the liberation, various publishers and publishing houses were targeted for their wartime record. Trials were held from 1944 to 1955, such as that of Robert Denoe¨l, who was ultimately acquitted. As the years went by, attitudes softened, and most publishing houses were able to make a good case for their wartime activities. <br><br>*”Des écrivains et de leurs éditeurs,” in P.

He then embarked on a career in industry, becoming managing director of Japy Frères and Pont à Mousson, a steel-marketing syndicate. In the 1930s, Pucheu joined Colonel François de La Rocque’s Croix de Feu and then Jacques Doriot’s Parti Populaire Français (PPF) but resigned in 1939 over Doriot’s stand in support of the Munich appeasement policy. Under Vichy, Pucheu first became president of a government-sponsored committee to regulate the engineering industry, and then minister of industrial production from February to June 1941. He advocated technocracy as the way to regenerate France. Pucheu next served as interior minister in Admiral Darlan’s government from July 1941 until April 1942. As interior minister, he helped create the Special Sections in Paris, which primarily condemned communists to death. Pucheu placed the French police at Germany’s disposal and harassed Doriot’s PPF, making its efforts to recruit in Vichy difficult. He resigned as interior minister when Laval returned to power. <br><br>Disillusioned with Vichy, Pucheu left France in early 1943 but was arrested on his arrival in Casablanca in May 1943. The Comité français pour la libération nationale, which planned to try former Vichy officials after the liberation, acceded to the demands of the Conseil Nationale de la résistance, especially its communist members, to try Pucheu immediately. At his trial, Pucheu claimed to have actually reduced the number of hostages shot by the Germans. He was, however, condemned to death. On 20 March 1944 he was executed. <br><br>F.

Some 8,000 to 9,000 people were executed for collaboration with the Occupation authorities, many by vigilante justice in what has been called the “<i>épuration sauvage</i>“ (wild, in the sense of nonlegal, purge) prior to the liberation. An additional 320,000 cases were heard after the liberation by judicial authorities of the Provisional Government and the Fourth Republic, resulting in some 44,000 prison terms and 1,500 death sentences. <br><br>The legal bases for the trials were taken from previously existing French jurisprudence, with additions such as the 8 August 1944 law that stipulated “<i>dégradation national</i>,” the loss of civic rights, as a punishment for collaboration. A special Haute Cour de Justice (High Court of Justice) tried 108 Vichy dignitaries, of whom eight were sentenced to death. Three were actually executed. Thirty-one convictions carried varying penalties, and three cases resulted in acquittal. <br><br>In addition to criticisms of ex post facto proceedings, inequitable treatment resulted from the fact that those caught immediately after the liberation often received punishment harsher than those who managed to escape hiding and were caught later, after passions had cooled. Indeed, the fury unleashed at the time of the liberation on women accused of “horizontal collaboration,” who were paraded publicly with heads shorn, may inadvertently, by releasing pent-up popular anger, have saved others from an even worse fate. Journalists and others who had taken public stands in favor of the Axis received penalties more severe than those, business leaders, for example, whose collaboration may have been more harmful to French interests but had also been more discreet. In addition, many of those who served on local purge tribunals were appointed by the Resistance committees, effectively combining the roles of prosecutor and judge. Interested in maintaining order and rebuilding the French economy, the Provisional Government also looked the other way with regard to the wartime activities of many among the French political and economic elites. <br><br>By 1947 and 1948, passions had cooled, and the pace of the purges slowed. Limited amnesty laws were passed in 1947, followed by more encompassing ones in 1951 and 1953. By 1964, there was no one left in prison as a result of wartime activity. That year, however, the French parliament passed a law removing the statute of limitations from crimes against humanity. As attention focused more closely in the 1970s and thereafter on official French complicity in the Holocaust, a few surviving participants were brought up for trial on charges of crimes against humanity. These included Klaus Barbie, head of the Gestapo in Lyons, convicted in 1983, and the <i>milice </i>officer Paul Touvier, the first Frenchman to be so convicted, in 1994.

At first, the decrees targeted recently naturalized citizens (revoking their French citizenship), but increasingly they applied to all Jews.

On 28 September, the first of the “Otto lists” appeared, banning the works of Jewish authors, among others. By such small increments, Jews were gradually marginalized, until by the time of the Vélodrome d’hiver roundup, on 16 July 1942, the mechanisms—both “legal” and logistical—to identify, round up, and deport large numbers of French Jews existed, due to the Vichy government.

Radio-Paris, created by Goebbels’ Propaganda Department in the autumn of 1940, was directed by Dr. Alfred Bofinger, of Radio-Stuttgart, with musical varieties and classical concerts featuring the best orchestras and virtuosi. Radio-Paris voices included those of Georges Oltramare, “Dr. Friedrich,” in reality, Friedrich Dambmann, another veteran of Radio-Stuttgart, and pro- German French journalists who reproached Vichy policy for being insufficient in its ardor for the New Order.

Radio-Vichy featured a monotonous program of youth and peasant projects, the changing of the guard, and the marshal’s Sunday walkabouts. Gaullist broadcasts from London obliged Vichy to abandon its “neutrality,” responding with repression, jamming, and counterpropaganda. Fines and imprisonment fell short of German demands for the death penalty for listening to the BBC. Jamming London’s broadcasts forced Radio-Vichy to rely on German technical assistance to defend its radio sovereignty. Counterpropaganda featured Paul Creyssel and Philippe Henriot. De Gaulle was described as the “Kerensky of the Kremlin” and Churchill’s mercenary. Loyalty to the marshal and obedience to Pierre Laval’s compulsory labor draft were dominant themes. By 1943 Radio-Vichy had become a fief of the Germans.

Founded at the beginning of February 1941, in the wake of Marshal Pétain’s firing of Pierre Laval (13 December 1940), the RNP supported Laval and opposed the Vichy “reactionaries” in Pétain’s entourage, as well as Jacques Doriot’s Parti Populaire Français (PPF), seen as too Stalinist in its methods and personnel. <br><br>Supported by Laval and Otto Abetz, the new party was headed by former socialist Marcel Déat, together with two leaders of the Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire (MSR), Eugène Deloncle and Jean van Ormelingen, also known as Vanor; Jean Fontenoy, a journalist, formerly with the communists, then the PPF; and Jean Goy, president of the Union National des Combattants, a right-wing veterans’ group. Although the party claimed half a million members, it never attracted more than 30,000 throughout France, although it did create subsidiary organizations for labor, education, peasants, and North Africa. On 27 August 1941, during a rally for the newly created anti-Bolshevik Lé- gion des Volontaires Français, Laval and Déat were wounded in an assassination attempt for which Déat blamed Deloncle, the former head of the interwar conspiratorial Cagoule. While convalescing, Déat organized the expulsion of the MSR faction from the RNP. In an operation that had comic opera qualities, Déat’s supporters expelled the MSR faction from the RNP headquarters with the obvious connivance of French and German police. <br><br>The purged RNP looked to the interwar noncommunist Left for recruits. Déat, who emerged as the unquestioned leader, introduced former socialists, syndicalists, and teachers, such as Georges Albertini, who reorganized the party, giving it a more Republican image than its collaborationist rivals, chiefly the PPF. The party also attracted a relatively larger number of women, some undoubtedly hoping thereby to win the release of prisoners of war in Germany. With the changing tide of the war, the RNP was weakened, decisively after March 1944, when Déat became minister of labor and national solidarity and devoted his attention to other matters. <br><br>M.

It was created in July 1940 by Jacques Doriot, whose Parti Populaire Français’ (PPF) activities were severely curtailed under the German law banning French political parties. Ostensibly swearing allegiance to Marshal Pétain, Doriot meant to rally anti- Republican, anticommunist, and Anglophobic elements in the hope of creating a single party he would lead. Shortly after the British attack on French naval vessels at Mers-el-Kébir, he announced in Paris the creation of the new movement (Rassemblement). <br><br>Its leadership included communists who had switched over to the PPF after the signing of the Nazi–Soviet Pact (former party secretary Marcel Gitton, Jean- Marie Clamamus, Marcel Capron, André Parsal, Marcel Bront, Fernand Soupé, Albert Clément, Émile Nédelec, and Joseph Barthélémy). The presence of excommunists in the organization’s ranks aroused Vichy’s suspicions, while the Germans, judging Doriot too unpredictable, favored more traditional politicians such as Pierre Laval and Marcel Déat. Although mentioned in Pétain’s 11 October 1940 message outlining the doctrine of the National Revolution, the Rassemblement never became the single mass party that its supporters had envisioned.

Theoretically, rationing was put in place to help the most unfortunate and reduce inequalities, assuring the distribution to all segments of the population the quantities of foodstuffs to which they were entitled at moderate prices. This enabled the state to exercise control over prices and the distribution of merchandise. <br><br>Beginning September 1940, the Vichy government administered a system of ration cards allotting specific quantities of food according to one’s needs, based on age and profession. The population was divided into six categories of consumers by age: category E for children from birth to 3 years of age, J1 and J2 for children up to 12 years old, J3 for adolescents, 13 to 21 years old, A for adults, and V for the elderly, above age 70. Heavy laborers such as miners were given extra supplements, as were pregnant women, adding two more categories for a total of eight. To obtain bread, meat, or sugar, each person had to have a certain number of tickets valid for a given week or month. Following the calculations of the nutritionists of the era, the base ration for urban dwellers barely exceeded 1,300 calories, which was lowered to 1,100 in 1943. <br><br>Problems quickly arose. Insufficient rations pushed families to resort to all sorts of means, legal (<i>colis familiaux</i>, or packages sent by family members, often from the countryside) and illegal (the black market). Resourcefulness became systematized, while the black market was essential for a proportion of households that sought food through direct and illegal purchases in the countryside. There was, nonetheless, a large difference, on one hand, between those who bought a kilo of butter or meat on the farm above the official price—which was tolerated after March 1942—and, on the other, the large-scale dealers who worked for the Germans or the luxury restaurants. <br><br>H.

Following Hitler’s rise to power, German refugees began trickling into France, as did in the mid-1930s, a few Poles. The first major wave of foreign refugees resulted from the Spanish civil war, when many departments in southern France opened camps to house the fleeing Spanish Republicans in the mid-1930s. Many of these camps in the Pyrenees and the Cevannes and as far north as the Cher-et-Loire functioned until World War II and were subsequently converted to accommodate new refugee populations. The French government welcomed these political refugees and extended to some a minimal amount of financial support in the form of refugee allocations. Many of the refugees enlisted in the French army and fought in the Battle of France. Following the June 1940 defeat, the overwhelming number of refugees were Belgians, Alsatians, Lorrainers, and Jews—foreign and French. On 5 July 1940, the prefect Pierre Marlier, director of the Service of Refugees for the Vichy government, met in Paris with General Alfred Streccius, the official representative of the German army, to discuss the status of French and foreign refugees in the unoccupied zone. The two parties agreed on conditions for repatriating refugees to the occupied zone and to Alsace and Lorraine, the latter two having been annexed by Germany. Foreign refugees, particularly Belgian and Dutch, were scheduled for return home in July and August. <br><br>During these discussions the two teams defined categories of refugees who qualified for repatriation to the occupied zone in France. Those denied access to the occupied zone included French and foreign Jews, communists, refugees of “mixed blood” (<i>sang mélangé</i>), and some categories of foreigners. During the following months of repatriation, German officials randomly turned back trains packed with more than 900 refugees due to the presence of one or two refugees of the excluded categories. <br><br>In the unoccupied zone, refugees received a daily stipend of 10 francs per adult and 8 per child. The Red Cross and other local charities organized the distribution of clothing and household utensils for refugees, many of whom lived in vacant hotels or public buildings such as schools. Vichy officials suspended relief on 30 September 1940 to all refugees eligible to return to the occupied zone. Only Alsatians and Lorrainers refusing to return to their now Germanannexed regions, French and foreign Jews, and a small number of miscellaneous refugees continued to benefit from Vichy government aid. By May 1942 the protected status of Jewish refugees in the unoccupied zone had expired. Roundups began in the summer of 1942, with state officials often using the same lists of refugee addresses previously used to administer aid. At least 150,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers remained in the unoccupied zone throughout the Occupation years and received preferential treatment with regard to lodging, schooling, and job placement, through programs organized by the Service of Refugees. <br><br>N.

As Germany’s need for manpower grew, and Sauckel intensified pressure for French labor, Laval proposed the Relève to avoid compulsory labor service. Announced on 22 June 1942, the Relève was supported by a massive propaganda campaign, with newspapers required to carry favorable reports of it. Laval hoped workers would volunteer, if not to help Germany defeat the Soviet Union, then out of sympathy for the prisoners. The three-to-one ratio was announced only in August, however, and newspapers were instructed to bury the information. <br><br>Although the Relève repatriated 90,747 POWs, it proved divisive, and the optimism it raised among the prisoners and their families quickly gave way to jealousy and suspicion. Many mistakenly believed that the Relève would liberate a prisoner whose family members volunteered to work in Germany. Because the results were unsatisfactory, French and German authorities quickly became coercive. On 4 September 1942 a Vichy law decreed a Service du Travail Obligatoire for men ages 18 to 50 and women ages 21 to 35 and initiated a census of workers. In certain factories Vichy imposed “voluntary” contracts on entire groups of workers. Public opinion considered the Relève thinly veiled forced labor, and disenchantment with Vichy deepened. With the 17 February 1943 mobilization of labor, Vichy abandoned the voluntary ruse. <br><br>Y. Durand, <i>La captivité </i>(Paris, 1980); S.

Yet they all shared the imperative to maintain and protect the lives of refugees, overwhelmingly Jewish, on French soil. The best-known organization was the Comité inter-mouvements auprès des évacués (Cimade). Founded in 1939 by Madeleine Barot, Cimade was a largely Protestant organization originally meant to aid inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine evacuated by the French government. This narrow mandate, under the pressure of the defeat of France and the exodus of refugees to the south, broadened in the summer of 1940. Cimade established a presence in several internment camps, providing food and medical care, as well as placing children with foster families or the <i>centres d’acceuil </i>(supervised residences) that it ran. By mid-1942, Cimade was fully engaged in hiding Jewish refugees and helping them escape into Switzerland.<br><br>Several organizations worked alongside Cimade, including the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), the American Friends Service Committee, the Unitarian Service Committee, and Amitiés chrétiennes. In late 1940, these organizations, along with Jewish welfare agencies, branches of the Red Cross, and Secours suisse, created the Comité de coordination pour l’assistance dans les camps (Comité de Nîmes). Presided over by Donald Lowrie, the American YMCA representative, the Comité de Nîmes helped establish the <i>centres d’acceuil </i>and secure the subsequent release of the children from the internment camps.<br><br>This move saved the lives of numerous children who otherwise would have been eventually deported from the camps. This prescient policy was advocated by the Oeuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE), a Jewish agency led by Andrée Salomon and Dr. Joseph Weill. Incorporated in 1942 into the Union générale des israélites de France (UGIF) the OSE played a critical role not only in emptying the camps of most of their adolescent internees but also in providing health care and food. The group also ran several clandestine child rescue networks and fabricated false papers—identification cards, working permits, and ration cards—for its Jewish charges. Anticipating Gestapo raids in the southern zone in 1944, the OSE closed down its 15 centers and placed the children with Christian religious institutions and Gentile families. In the northern zone, the fate of the UGIF centers was grimmer: in July 1944, they were raided by the Gestapo, and more than 250 children, along with their guardians, were deported to Auschwitz. None survived. <br><br>The ranks of the Éclaireurs israélites de France (ÉIF), or Jewish Boy Scouts, founded in 1923 by Robert Gamzon, overflowed with adolescent refugees who had either lost their families (through deportation or internment) or whose parents, fearful of imminent arrest, had placed them with the group. The ÉIF created several farms in the unoccupied zone, where Scouts were taught manual trades and Jewish history and culture. By late 1942, the leaders of the ÉIF began placing threatened foreign-born Scouts, armed with false documents, with non- Jewish organizations and individuals—an activity supported by the OSE and the Mouvement des Jeunesse Sioniste, or Zionist Youth Movement. There were dozens of smaller and local operations, such as the Comité rue Amelot in Paris, the Service André in Marseilles, and the Maurice Cachoud Group in Nice. Members ran enormous risks in their clandestine activity; dozens of men and women were captured, shot, or deported. Yet, along with the courage of these relative few, the complicity of countless Frenchmen and French women was essential. Some 20,000–30,000 Jewish children are estimated to have been saved. Were it not for the help of a largely sympathetic population, the number saved would have been far lower. <br><br>P. Joutard et al., <i>Cévennes: Terre de Refuge 1940–1944 </i>(Montpellier, 1987); S.

As a concept in France “Republic” transcends specific governments or regimes. Abolished on 11 July 1940, the Republic returned to continental France with the liberation and the arrival of the Provisional Government, which, headed by General de Gaulle, had still not been recognized by the Allies. Refusing to “proclaim the Republic” at the Paris Hôtel de Ville at the time of the liberation, on 25 August 1944, de Gaulle declared that the Republic already existed and had never ceased to exist. <br><br>This long-disputed theory of legality underlay the entire juridical construction of the Free France of 1940, which had become Fighting France in 1942 with the support of the Resistance organized by Jean Moulin. It is inherent in the proclamation of the need to “reestablish Republican legality,” which was at the heart of the conflict between General Henri Giraud, who did not wish to go beyond the respect for “human liberties,” and General de Gaulle, together with the Resistance, which proclaimed the legitimacy of the government of the Republic alone, the hope of a new Republic, the Fourth, announced in Algiers on 14 July 1943. <br><br>The Republic acceded with the instant disappearance of the Vichy regime and the triumphal welcome given by the French to the man of 18 June (1940) who had “reestablished” (or reincarnated) the Republic, “its name, its arms, and its laws.” Faithful to its principles, the Republic sought, however, to transform itself into the “regime” so as to guarantee the “separation of powers.” This resulted in a major conflict with the political forces, traditional and new; General de Gaulle resigned in January 1946. He returned to power in June 1958. His regime would be the Fifth Republic. <br><br>M. Agulhon, <i>La République.

case 772: $("div#commentary").html('<b>RESISTANCE,</b> a broad term referring to those who fought against, or in other ways attempted to subvert, German, Italian, and Japanese rule in the countries their forces occupied during World War II. After the defeat of France in 1940, few French sought to continue the fight. Aside from some members of parliament who took to the sea, trying to continue the war from Africa, hardly anyone had the heart to stand up to the Germans. General de Gaulle fled to London and proclaimed in his now famous speech of 18 June 1940 that the war had not been decided by the Battle of France, that as Germany had been victorious in 1940 by force of mechanized arms, it, in turn, would some day be defeated by even superior arms, and that “whatever happens, the flame of French Resistance must not and will not be extinguished.” Few, however, heard him at the time. The 80 members of parliament who voted on 10 July 1940 against giving plenipotentiary powers to Marshal Pétain to create a new government have also been classified among the “first resisters.” Gradually, the Resistance organized and intensified, helping the Allies in intelligence gathering and, eventually, on the battlefield as well. <br><br>Scattered acts of sabotage of phone lines began early. Isolated men and women who had endeavored to oppose military might often paid with their lives. In the northernmost region of France, closed off and made into a “forbidden” zone by Germany, some French citizens formed small groups of resisters, reminiscent of their elders in the northeastern area of France occupied by German forces during the 1914–1918 war. They kept their numbers small to avoid infiltration and arrest. <br><br>The earliest acts of Resistance, of necessity, were individual and unpublicized, and most of these will never be known. One of the earliest public gestures was a symbolic demonstration of secondary school students (<i>lycéens</i>), who celebrated the armistice of 1918 at the Arc de Triomphe on 11 November 1940. At the Musée de l’homme, also in Paris, a first nucleus of systematic Resistance was formed by ethnologists and other scientists who produced a clandestine paper calling on French people to fight the Occupation. Boris Vildé, an Estonian who had come recently to France, led this group, which included lawyers, mathematicians, and physicists. Their ranks, however, were infiltrated by Nazi informers, and almost all were arrested and executed by firing squads at Mont Valérien near Paris, even though the German military prosecutor spoke admiringly of their patriotism. One of them, Valentin Feldman, shouted at the moment of execution: “Imbeciles, it’s for you, too that I die!” <br><br>The German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 freed the French communists from the ban decreed by the Daladier government following the 1939 Nazi–Soviet pact. The German attack on the Soviet Union brought the communists, whose semisecret organization suited them well for clandestine activities, into the Resistance. German executions brought more and more of the French into the Resistance. In the occupied zone of France, some of the most devoted patriots worked for clandestine newspapers and Resistance movements such as Libération-nord. Another group was the Organisation Civile et Mil312 itaire. By distributing illegal tracts and doing messenger service and by a few armed attacks, people sought to weaken the seemingly invincible power of the Germans. <br><br>In the unoccupied zone by early 1942, several Resistance organizations had formed, although none had more than a few thousand members. The three major ones were Henri Frenay’s Combat, conservative, although it attracted some former socialists; Libération-sud, created by Emmanuel d’Astier de la Vigerie, more moderate in political viewpoint; and Franc-Tireur, a name meant to recall the 1870 war. Lyons, then the third largest city in France, became the principal center of the Resistance, though by the time of the liberation, as illegal action became easier, Paris once again became the focal point. <br><br>Despite deep political differences among the various Resistance movements and tensions between the external Resistance, headed by de Gaulle in London and, later, Algiers, and the underground in France, they never fought one another, as happened in other countries such as Yugoslavia. Eager to unite the Resistance groups under his own leadership, General de Gaulle dispatched a former prefect, Jean Moulin, to bring the groups together in France. In January 1943, after months of diligent and patient negotiations, Moulin was able to bring together the Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, which grouped together the noncommunist Resistance groups. In May 1943, Moulin organized the Conseil National de la Résistance, which included representatives from all the Resistance movements, together with the Left and center political parties and the trade unions. Shortly after his successes, Moulin fell into a trap, was taken prisoner, and was tortured to death. Moulin was succeeded by Georges Bidault. The institution in 1943 of the compulsory labor service (Service du Travail Obligatoire), which drafted young workers for service in Germany, drove many of them into hiding as outlaws in the <i>maquis</i>, from whence they often joined the Resistance. With the Allied landings in Normandy, many French Resistance groups, notably in Paris, emerged to help in the liberation of their country. <br><br>In retrospect, though the people who actually resisted were few in numbers, the Resistance contributed significantly to the Allied sweep through France in 1944. Equally memorable is the clandestine publication of books of real literary merit, such as Vercors’ <i>Silence de la mer</i>, which have taken their place in the French literary canon. Clandestine literature was published in secret by presses such as Éditions de minuit, staffed by devoted, unafraid printers, risking their lives, and distributed at great risk, reaching the outside world to demonstrate that French culture had not been extinguished by the Occupation. The Cahiers du Témoignage chrétien preached a Resistance according to Christian and ecumenical principles. Despite the brutality of the occupation authorities, especially in the latter stages of the war, the Resistance writers, by and large, avoided the chauvinistic excesses of World War I, when virtually everything German had been debunked. Resistance ideals of a France “<i>pur et dur</i>“ (pure and strong) may have receded after the war, but the image of Resistance heroism lived on, notably in the formal transfer of Jean Moulin’s ashes to the Pantheon, the temple of French patriotic glory, in 1964. <br><br>M.

Their review of the war years condemned the purge and produced a radically different image of wartime France from what was widely accepted at the time. In this rereading of the Occupation, the defeat and the armistice were inevitable; Vichy resisted alongside a leftwing Resistance led by communists. At the same time, a right-wing, often anti- Gaullist, Resistance evolved that remained faithful to the French military tradition. Such right-wing “resisters” considered that, since the liberation, the officially accepted Resistance had drawn them into a Franco-French civil war. This battle against the perceived injustices of the purge was waged by the writers of the Hussards and in journals such as <i>Écrits de Paris</i>, as well as in pamphlets like the Abbé Jean-Marie Desgranges’ <i>Les Crimes masqués du résistantialisme </i>(1948), which defended the actions of Vichy ministers, as well as condemning false resisters. For many, in the late 1940s and 1950s, it seemed like the world turned upside down as collaborators were amnestied while former resisters were being tried. <br><br>The term <i>résistancialisme </i>is sometimes used for the generally heroic images of a united, resisting France that grew out of a Gaullist interpretation of the war years.

Because relatively few political groups actually name themselves “right” or “left”—the French Jeune Droite of the 1930s being something of an exception—these terms have been often used rhetorically, especially since the mid-1960s, to designate one’s political opponents. Often qualifiers, such as “moderate” or “extreme,” are used. <br><br>By common agreement, during the 1789 revolution the terms “right” and “left” were first used to denote opposing political factions, with the more revolutionary National Assembly deputies sitting to the left of the speaker’s chair, and the more conservative to the chair’s right. In general, right and left are differentiated by claims to privilege, accorded increasingly narrowly as one goes further right, from gender, race, caste, class, party, to the single privileged individual of despotic and some anarchist theories. Right-left dialogue, however, shifts continually as a consequence of changing historical circumstances. Metaphorical usages parallel to “right” and “left” are evident long before 1789. They include “patrician versus plebeian,” “Guelf versus Ghibelline,” “Jesuit versus Jansenist,” and “Cavaliers versus Roundheads.” The eighteenth century produced Tories and Whigs in England, aristocratic “Hats” and liberal “Caps” in Sweden, governmental “<i>Négatifs</i>“ and more democratic “<i>Repré- sentants</i>“ in Switzerland, and Loyalists and Patriots in America. Even after the appearance of “right” and “left,” dualistic sets of terms continued to shift, giving rise to “Anglophiles” and “Patriots,” “Girondins” and “Montagnards,” “Jacobins” and “Enragés,” and, after 1814, “Liberals” and “Conservatives,” to name a few. “Right” and “left” gained greater currency with the spread of parliamentary government in Western and Central Europe during the last third of the nineteenth century. By the late-1930s, French right-left divisions were compounded by splits between <i>Munichois</i>, in favor of the 1938 Munich agreement, and <i>anti-Munichois</i>, the two factions also called <i>pacifistes </i>and <i>bellicistes</i>, respectively, a division that continued in the collaboration– resistance cleavage of the Occupation years. <br><br>During the Occupation, collaborators, resisters, and <i>attentistes </i>all came from various parts of the political spectrum. Although Vichy and the nongovernmental collaboration had largely right-wing origins, these groups were not monolithic, and they drew prominent supporters from the interwar Left, as in the examples of René Belin, Gaston Bergery, Hubert Lagardelle, and Marcel Déat.<br><br>The Resistance attracted support from the interwar Left but also from the Right, as in the cases of Emmanuel d’Astier de la Vigerie, Henri Frenay, and Colonels Passy and Rémy. The complex role of the French communists from the signing of the August 1939 Nazi–Soviet pact to the German invasion of the USSR is still debated. After the liberation, the Right, tarnished by association with Vichy and the collaboration, found a voice with the “Hussards,” who argued that “leftists” had often collaborated, and “rightists” had often resisted. <br><br>P.

The Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance (<i>Yad Vashem</i>) Law, passed by the Israeli Kneset (parliament) in 1953, charged <i>Yad Vashem </i>with authenticating their deeds and perpetuating their memory. Since 1962 a public commission has been empowered to recognize the Righteous, based on contemporary documentation and the testimony of those rescued. The main criteria for recognition are (1) a concrete rescue action, (2) the rescue carried out at personal risk, and (3) remuneration neither requested nor received by the rescuer. By the end of 1995, 13,618 such cases were authenticated, including 1,366 from France, most of them involving couples or entire families. <br><br>The list of French Righteous includes eight bishops, such as Cardinal Pierre- Marie Gerlier, Jules Gérard Saliège, and Cardinal Pierre-Marie Théas, all of whom openly condemned the deportation of the Jews and, even if their lives were not in peril, contributed greatly to many rescues. More than 60 Catholic clergymen, such as Father Pierre Chaillet and Father Marie-Benoît (Pierre Pé- teul), who worked tirelessly to rescue Jews, are recognized. Forty-three Protestant clergymen are recognized, in most cases accompanied by their spouses. Such were André and Magda Trocmé of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, who enrolled their entire communities into rescue actions. Some, such as André Trocmé, paid for their generosity with their lives. <br><br>Most of the Righteous, however, were ordinary people—social workers such as Renaudin Aline or Suzanne Boulat, who worked with the Jewish underground, and educators such as Juliette Vidal and Marinette Guy of Saint-Étienne, who saved many children. Lucien and Agnés Bertrand were bakers who hid and saved two persons unknown to them before the Occupation; Juliette Domenq, a worker, saved a family, unacquainted with her before. Josephine and Charles Baud, peasants, saved two young boys, one of them the son of an industrialist from Luxemburg who spent a vacation in their village before the war and another brought to them by the Jewish communist organization. Joseph and Ernestine Ducret were also peasants, who hid Jewish families on their farm by giving them their own identity papers. Valentin and Marie Daubas, from a small village in Gers, concealed a young woman and her family when Jews were being deported. The farm of Albert and Germain Guilmin in the village of Peloisières (Sarthe) served as a temporary haven for more than 100 Jews. Charles Gombert, a railway worker, saved two escapees from a deportation train in the Vosges. Gérard and Louise Bouquey saved Perla Waver, a Jewish woman and her three children, ages two through six, in Barenton, a small village in Normandy. Even a guard of the notorious Drancy camp Camille Mathieu, with the assistance of his wife, Denise, rescued three Jewish families. <br><br>A.

Léon Blum, the former premier, was accused of having supported Republican Spain in 1936, threatening to embroil France in a war against its own interests; former premiers Édouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud and interior minister Georges Mandel were charged with declaring and pursuing war in 1939 against Pétain’s and General Maxime Weygand’s counsel. Air ministers Pierre Cot and Guy La Chambre were blamed for France’s aerial inferiority.

While the Germans expected the defendants to be found guilty of declaring war, Vichy wanted them found guilty of losing it. The trial opened to a war situation different in 1942 from that of 1940. Britain, undefeated and allied with the Soviet Union and the United States, cast doubts on Axis victory and French collaboration in the New Order. Maurice Schumann’s BBC broadcasts noted that Pétain, as war minister in 1934, had neglected the Ardennes’ sector, the very place where the Germans broke through in 1940. <br><br>Blum and Daladier defended the Popular Front’s military rearmament, which had poured billions of francs into tanks and planes, rather than the concrete fortifications of the Maginot Line.

case 779: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN FRANCE</b> was divided into various camps during the war years, representing the full range of options, from pro- German collaboration, to active armed resistance. The church had suffered from the separation of church and state in 1905 and had watched religious practice decline at an alarming rate, especially among the lower classes. It feared the expansion of the political Left and was virtually unanimous in its opposition to communism. <br><br>The church thus welcomed the advent of the Vichy regime, its self-styled National Revolution, and its rhetoric of family and social solidarity. Vichy’s anti-Semitic legislation was not cause for outcry from the bishops. Even noted Catholic progressives expressed hopes that the National Revolution would embody the radical transformation that they believed France needed. The Jeunesse Ouvrière Chrétienne (JOC) applauded Vichy’s dissolution of communist youth groups, and it took Emmanuel Mounier roughly two years to move toward resistance. The École Nationale des Cadres, founded in 1940 at Uriage, was a veritable “macho” Catholic “think-tank” and training school for men committed to the Vichy vision. Initially, at least, the vast majority of vocal Catholics were collaborators in the Pétainiste mode. <br><br>However, some active Catholics were implicated deeply in more directly fascist and pro-Nazi activities. Xavier Vallat was the architect of Vichy’s anti- Semitic legislation, Philippe Henriot was a leader of the <i>milice</i>, numerous Catholics joined Charles Maurras in his Jew-denouncing Action Française, and Cardinal Alfred Baudrillart was a militant advocate for the Nazi-led anti- Bolshevik crusade in the east. Fascist French Catholics were a small minority, but their prominence and the refusal of Catholic prelates to repudiate them helped tarnish the church. <br><br>Some devout Catholics joined the Resistance immediately after the fall of France. Most of these had been part of interwar Christian democratic organizations, progressive Catholic newspapers (such as <i>L’Aube</i>), and the confessional trade union movement. Henri Frenay, of the Combat movement, was a Catholic, as was General de Gaulle himself. Temoignage Chrétien and its wellorganized team had impeccable Resistance credentials from the early years of Vichy, and by the latter years many members had taken up arms against the occupier. Catholicism gave many martyrs to the cause of liberation, not least of whom were the worker-priests Camille Folliet and Gilbert Dru, Catholic visionaries for a united Left. <br><br>After the 1943 forced labor requisition (Service du Travail Obligatoire), Catholic Resistance became a serious force in occupied France. The JOC had entered the Resistance in an organized way; the Témoignage chrétien team was in full flower; Gilbert Dru was trying to organize a Christian democratic movement; clandestine Catholic experiments were set in motion behind the backs of the Germans; and Georges Bidault, a devout Catholic, had been appointed by de Gaulle to lead the Conseil National de la Resistance. No longer the choice of only a few, Catholic Resistance had joined the national Resistance networks and had launched some of its own. <br><br>Both communists and Catholics, outsiders in the Third Republic, entered the postwar years with Resistance laurels. In the case of French Catholics it was overwhelmingly the work of the laity and a few “grassroots” clergy. The hierarchy’s reputation had been seriously tarnished. This unusual situation allowed progressive Catholics to set a new tone for their church and nation that was instrumental in forming the character of the Second Vatican Council. In late September 1997, Archbishop Oliver de Berranger of Saint-Denis formally apologized on behalf of the Church for the “silence” of the majority of the hierarchy in the face of French collaboration with anti-Jewish persecution during the Occupation. <br><br>*L.

Born into a bourgeois Catholic family from the Beaujolais, he entered the École des Chartes in 1905. Romier emerged a trained historian specializing in sixteenth-century French history. Because frail health kept him out of World War I, he was attached to the National Association for Economic Expansion, where he studied production problems. After the war he turned to journalism and became first editor in chief of <i>La Journée industrielle</i>, and then an editorial writer for <i>Le Figaro</i>. A member of Redressement français, an economic study group founded by Ernest Mercier, Romier met Marshal Pétain at its meetings. The two men discovered their common affinity for a traditional rural and Catholic France. After the defeat of 1940, Romier joined the marshal’s entourage at Vichy. In 1941 he was named to the Conseil national and presided over sessions of the commission charged with the administrative reorganization of the French state. That same year he became a minister of state. Romier was given responsibility for convening a national assembly that would reinforce Pétain’s authority as well as presiding over the drafting of a constitution for the Vichy regime. Neither project ever materialized, however. German authorities having placed him on a list of “undesirable elements” to be eliminated, Romier resigned as minister of state at the end of 1943.

As opposed to his subordinate, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, Rundstedt planned to defeat Allied landing forces not immediately on the coast but subsequently by means of a flexible introduction of larger armored reserves. Hitler opted for a compromise, so that neither Rommel’s nor Rundstedt’s strategies were followed. Deceived by the Allied intelligence agencies in 1944, Rundstedt anticipated a second landing at Calais and waited too long to send larger forces to the Normandy front. With heavy Allied air and matériel superiority, he urged a partial retreat and a switch to a flexible defensive strategy. Hitler rejected this and ordered the defense of every inch of territory.

Though paralyzed after 1932 in his legs and, increasingly, his speech, Saliège was among the most forceful moral spokesman for French Catholicism during World War II. A former member of Sillon, the liberal Catholic movement founded by Marc Sangnier, Saliège supported a rapprochement between the church and the Republic. This spirit of reconciliation was encouraged by Saliège’s immediate circle—most notably, Monsignor Bruno de Solages, rector of the city’s Catholic Institute—which had long been engaged in a dialogue with progressive political elements in Toulouse. Though Saliège supported Pétain, he was skeptical about the Vichy regime. In his diocese’s <i>La Semaine religieuse</i>, the archbishop repeatedly warned his readers that force must not be confounded with right. These warnings gained immediacy in the summer of 1942, with Vichy’s roundup and deportation of foreign-born Jews. Informed of events unfolding at Noé and Récébédou, two nearby concentration camps, Saliège wrote a blistering condemnation. Ignoring the local prefect’s intervention, Saliège ordered the sermon read in all the diocese’s churches, and it quickly became one of the great texts of spiritual resistance.<br><br>Though Saliège emphasized that his criticism was limited to Vichy’s Jewish policies, his ties to the regime increasingly frayed.

When the program ended in July 1944, some three-quarters of a million French workers had been sent to Germany (half the figure demanded by Sauckel), with another half million engaged in German factories in France. Conditions were generally harsh, and French workers killed in Allied bombings probably numbered in the tens of thousands. <br><br>The STO aided the Resistance by contributing substantially to the population’s disaffection toward Vichy and the Occupation. The armed underground movements were strengthened by their involvement in large-scale creation of refuges and networks for STO rebels. Further, the statement by Cardinal Achille Liénart (15 March 1943), permitting Catholic noncompliance with STO laws, marked a critical break in church support for Vichy. <br><br>At the liberation, repatriated STO workers often faced ostracism and have remained a discomfort in the national conscience, because the question that they raised—did nondisobedience to a collaborationist French law constitute collaboration?— had national implications. <br><br>J.

Conservative Algerian notables joined communist and socialist leaders in welcoming the reforms, although Abbas and the radical Algerian People’s Party (PPA), headed by Messali Hadj, denounced them. The latter formed a loose coalition, the Friends of the Manifesto and of Liberty (AML), to agitate against the New Order. By the spring of 1945, PPA cadres stood poised to win control of the AML, precipitating clashes between Abbas’ moderates and militant trade unionists loyal to Messali Hadj. Jockeying between the two factions accompanied escalating unemployment and decreasing food stocks in local markets. May Day demonstrations in Algiers and Oran turned violent, as police assaulted marchers carrying the banner of the nineteenth-century anti-French leader al-Amir Abd al-Qadir. AML representatives in Sétif—which had a history of both anti-French and anti-Jewish violence—and in the nearby town of Guelma were granted permission to organize rallies celebrating VE Day on condition that no Algerian flags or inflammatory placards be displayed. Demonstrators ignored the prohibition; gendarmes in the two towns first attempted to seize nationalist emblems and then shot into the crowd, sparking a wave of attacks against government installations and <i>colon </i>farms scattered across the northeastern highlands. French commanders called in some 10,000 troops to quash the insurrection, used aircraft transferred second-hand from the U.S. Army Air Force to destroy villages suspected of harboring rebels, and deployed warships to interdict traffic moving along the coast. At Guelma, authorities permitted <i>colons </i>to form a vigilante group, which indiscriminately slaughtered inhabitants of surrounding villages. Meanwhile, the Algerian Communist Party publicly dissociated itself from the insurrection, which it considered “fascist-inspired,” and collaborated with the government to suppress it. <br><br>French officials abruptly terminated two separate boards of inquiry into the events of May 1945, so casualty figures remain in dispute. At least 100 Europeans died during the rebellion, along with 6,000 to 35,000 indigenous Algerians. The ruthlessness with which the authorities crushed the revolt propelled Radicals into the vanguard of the Algerian national movement, thoroughly discredited local communists, and convinced the country’s <i>colons </i>that the drive for independence could be stopped by brute force. <br><br>J.-P.

In June and July 1940, the German victory in France opened a number of possibilities for Spain but its ambitions were held in check by a healthy fear of German intentions plus a realistic, and British-financed, understanding of its own weaknesses. <br><br>With the Second World War approaching, France wanted to secure its border on the Pyrenees. Consequently, Marshal Philippe Pétain was sent as ambassador to Francisco Franco’s capital of Burgos, during the Spanish civil war, in early 1938. Pétain pressed the French government to restore Spanish government property (gold, merchant and naval fleets, and works of art) that had been spirited out of the country. Once the process was begun, Franco sent Felix de Lequerica to Paris as ambassador in March 1939. <br><br>As the French army collapsed in June 1940, Ambassador Lequerica was asked to help arrange an armistice with Germany (whereupon all French communications with Spain were immediately handed to the Germans). The Franco government considered expanding Spanish Morocco south to the Spanish enclave of Ifni and east to Oran. Having first proclaimed Spain neutral, Franco on 12 June declared Spain a “nonbelligerent” power and two days later seized full control of the international zone of Tangiers. This turned out to be the extent of Spanish gains during the war, since the Germans did not demand the demilitarization of French forces in North Africa, and General Auguste Noguès, the French commander in Morocco, made it clear he would resist any further Spanish expansion. <br><br>Although German Admiral Erich Raeder favored a strategy to engage Spain, seize Gibraltar, and establish a German presence in the Mediterranean and North Africa, Hitler ignored his advice. Thus Franco’s offer of 19 June to enter the war on Germany’s side, if compensated at French expense, was not taken seriously until August when the Germans finally became receptive to the idea, but by then their failure to invade Britain and generous British bribes, paid between May and July to leading Spanish Falangists such as General Antonio Aranda Mata, had produced second thoughts in Spain about the advisability of an alliance with Hitler. <br><br>By 23 October, when Hitler met Franco at Hendaye, the German army was already deployed to occupy France rather than move south, while British resistance had stiffened. These factors, combined with Spain’s need for American grain, following the debilitating civil war, all went far to temper Franco’s initial enthusiasm for joining the Axis. The German failure to act more quickly, it could be argued, cost them the chance to block the British from the Mediterranean during a brief window of opportunity in June-July, when Britain was highly vulnerable. Hitler was left without a secure western front and saw the World War I nightmare of a two-front war come about again when the Germans did attack the Soviet Union in June 1941. <br><br>Until November 1942, the Falangist press continued to demand Spain’s “place in the sun” at French expense, but Spanish diplomats never seriously pressed the matter. Instead, efforts were made to develop closer Franco-Spanish relations, emphasizing economics, religion, and their shared “Latin” heritage. Thus, visits between Spain and France were exchanged, but little else. The head of the French Catholic Church visited Spain, and Franco made a quick stop in Montpellier to see Pétain in February 1942. By then, both countries wanted to keep the Germans out of the western Mediterranean and, consequently, did their best to discourage German interest in the area. With the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 the three cards that Vichy had held (the southern two-fifths of unoccupied France, the French fleet, and French North Africa) were trumped. Franco, for his part, had given up any dreams of expansion and thought only of survival. <br><br>Although Spain continued to recognize the Pétain government, it began hedging its bets by establishing contacts with de Gaulle’s Comité français de la libération nationale (CFLN). Thousands of young Frenchmen (30,000 by the spring of 1944) were crossing into Spain to join the Free French forces. In August 1944, Lequerica was recalled from Vichy to become foreign minister (and never replaced), and on 1 September 1944 Vichy ambassador François Piétri handed over the French Embassy to Jacques Truelle, the representative of the CFLN, now the Provisional Government. One final item handed over, on 31 July 1945, was Vichy’s former head of government, Pierre Laval. Relations, however, remained troubled as the French allowed Spanish Republicans to start guerrilla operations in Catalonia and closed the border from 1946 to 1948. <br><br>Spain was never in a position, by itself, either to help or threaten France in any serious way between 1938 and 1946. Spain’s unrealistic imperial dreams, which might have had some potential had Hitler been more forthcoming in June 1940, were soon replaced by a more practical desire for self-preservation, as Germany’s chances for victory became increasingly problematic. Thereafter, the governments of Pétain and Franco could attempt only to survive in a hostile world. <br><br>*†J.-M.

They formed part of a general repression of “terrorists” and were generally attached to military or naval tribunals (courts-martial). In areas lacking such tribunals, their powers devolved to the courts of appeals, as in the case of Paris, which was empowered to pronounce verdicts on both guilt and punishment. <br><br>Alleged offenders caught in the act were brought directly before these courts for immediate sentencing. There was no appeal. Sentences, including imprisonment, hard labor, and death, were carried out without delay. With increased cooperation between German authorities and the French forces of order, these courts reflected an emerging police state and the end of the National Revolution. Justice minister Joseph Barthélemy prevailed upon the courts of appeals to appoint judges who would act firmly against those, particularly communists, with whom opposition to the regime was identified. The hastily created Paris Special Section condemned three communists to death in August 1941 for breaking the 1939 decree banning the existence of their party. <br><br>The deterrent effect of the Special Sections was restricted, as their executions served only to bolster communist resolve and enhance their martyr reputation as “<i>le Parti des Fusillés</i>“ (the party of the executed). Declaring his passion for defending hopeless cases, Jacques Isorni, the lawyer who later defended Marshal Pétain against treason charges, figured prominently in the defense of communists and other resisters brought before these courts. The creation of the Special Sections marked an important turning point in Vichy’s attitude and ideology and evidence of increased collaboration with the Germans. <br><br>R. O.

Spinasse, a former philosophy student at the Sorbonne, ran the <i>Populaire du Centre </i>newspaper in the 1920s and taught at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, specializing in the history of the workplace. He participated in X-crise, one of several informal groups of technocrats who met in the 1930s to plan new interventionist solutions for the economic woes of France. Spinasse was named economics minister by Blum in 1936, and then finance minister during Blum’s second and brief mandate in 1938. Nevertheless, Spinasse, a much decorated veteran of World War I, remained loyal to Blum’s rival, the pacifist Paul Faure, general secretary of the Socialist Party. <br><br>Spinasse was among the 89 socialist parliamentarians who supported giving full powers to Marshal Pétain, on 10 July 1940. Spinasse edited two pro-Vichy newspapers with a neosocialist agenda, <i>L’Effort </i>and the more culturally oriented <i>Le Rouge et le Bleu</i>, in which he sought to convince French socialists that dignified collaboration with Nazi Germany was the only option for a defeated people. “The conquerors,” he wrote, “need France as much as the old Roman Empire once needed Gaul.” By August 1942, he was made aware that his relatively moderate views in favor of collaborationism were neither welcome to the Nazis nor the pro-Nazi Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP) of Marcel Déat. Spinasse retired to his hometown, Egletons (Corrèze), and <i>Le Rouge et le Bleu </i>stopped publication. Condemned to ineligibility for life as a deputy by a liberation tribunal and excluded from the Socialist Party, he became a bookseller but remained active in Corrèze politics.

Although the Germans and their collaborationist allies distrusted Borotra be338 cause of his Jewish wife and his connections to General de Gaulle and Britain, Borotra managed to retain his post until Laval returned to power in April 1942. Vichy sports policies, under Borotra, were a fertile hybrid. They retained many of Léo Lagrange’s Popular Front programs and anticipated much of the dynamism of sports organizations in post-1945 era. For example, Vichy’s national sporting license (Brevet Sportif National) was merely a change in adjective from that of the Popular Front. Due to Borotra’s energy and to the increase in the number of hours devoted to sports in education, athletic participation by both boys and girls rose dramatically. The number of university and school competitors rose from 17,000 in 1938 to 47,000 in 1942. Over the same period, marked increases were noted in other sports: from 188,000 to 294,000 in the Football Federation and from 26,000 to 46,000 in track and field. To handle the heavy demand, Borotra initiated a massive training program for athletic coaches, but by the eve of his dismissal (April 1942) only 2,000 had been graduated. Nevertheless, 2 national and 15 regional athletic training centers had been established. Borotra was also successful in obtaining large capital expenditures for sports facilities. <br><br>Colonel Joseph Pascot, who had served under Borotra, was his successor.

As a result, French workers had to work longer hours, with less food, clothing, soap, and other necessities. <br><br>The strike began as a call for better work conditions, salaries, and food distribution. Workers at first directed their anger at the bosses, who they believed exploited German demands to renege on the 1936 collective labor agreements. French police attempted to control the situation by making arrests on 28 May. Quickly the strike took on an anti-German tone and spread to all mines in the area, with 80 percent of the miners (nearly 100,000) on strike by 4 June. Women played a major role in the strike, walking out of several factories, standing at the shafts to deter miners from entering, and trying to prevent the authorities from arresting the men. General Heinrich Niehoff, the German commander in Lille, crushed the strike with troops and courts-martial. About 400 workers were arrested; 235 were deported to work in Germany; 130 never returned. The strike cost the German war effort about 500,000 tons of coal, one quarter of the normal regional monthly output.

He convinced his colleagues to create a seminary, the Mission de France, designed to reach peasants and workers alienated from the church.

Flaunting the stipulation that clothing should use as little fabric as possible, they wore long jackets and short pants with big, baggy knees and narrow ankles over white socks. Young women thumbed their noses at the conservative, fresh-scrubbed feminine look Vichy promoted by dying their hair blond, piling on makeup, and wearing short, pleated skirts, jackets with large, padded shoulders, and heavy, flat shoes.

Because of the restrictions and politicization of the war and Occupation, objects of everyday life, such as the radio, often acquired enhanced symbolic value. <br><br>In 1940, for the first time in French history, a major national decision became known through broadcasting: Marshal Pétain’s call for an armistice. Pro- German Radio-Paris and the English BBC vied for listeners’ attention. Like bicycles, ration tickets, curfews, and the <i>Système D </i>(a term for surviving by one’s wits—somehow making do), the radio itself became a symbol in everyday life in wartime France. Verbal symbols broadcast on the radio included Pétain’s call for an armistice, represented in the “gift of his person” to spare the French in their defeat, and de Gaulle’s radio addresses from London, which symbolized him as “the man of 18 June” (his first broadcast having been 18 June 1940). <br><br>As a symbol of social cohesion “Pétain” appeared in <i>La Semaine réligieuse </i>(The Religious Week), in coloring books for children, and on posters and post cards, as well as in l’Art maréchal generally. His emphasis on a return to tradition and regionalism highlighted symbols of village and rural life. Symbols of collaboration included widely disseminated photographs of the Montoire handshake between Pétain and Hitler. Joan of Arc acquired symbolic value on both sides of the resistance/collaboration divide. Songs such as the “Chant des Partisans” and “Maréchal, nous voila`” evoked Pétainist and Resistance symbols respectively. <br><br>Resisters’ poems and anti-German propaganda, often using symbols such as the Cross of Lorraine, were dropped from Royal Air Force planes. The battle of Bir Hakeim became a Resistance symbol of successful military action against the Axis. A little publicized governmental service at Vichy, the Contrôles techniques, implicitly recognized the widespread presence of political symbols by violating the privacy of the mail, opening 320,000 to 370,000 letters every week, and tapping phone conversations to report opposition to the police. In a larger sense “France” itself was a symbol as were “Vichy” and “Free France” each with ramifications usually associated with literary texts. The importance of symbols and their diffusion in the years from 1940 through 1944 did not escape the French at the liberation, whose celebrations, including shaving the heads of women accused of “horizontal collaboration” with the enemy, were organized as symbolic rituals. <br><br>A.

The Coutrot affair provided an opportunity for elements within Vichy’s intelligence network to construct and spread rumors of a “synarchist plot” by connecting disparate pieces of evidence relating to the rise of managers and technicians, perceived as pro- British and American, in key positions in the new regime. Vichy traditionalists, Paris collaborationists, and others fearful of technocracy and resentful of a new sociopolitical elite seized upon the widely diffused plot rumors. These rumors were based on an actual document, entitled the <i>Pacte synarchique</i>, that had circulated before the war. A ponderous manifesto by a small, politicized, occultist, Masonic sect, the <i>Pacte synarchique </i>called for a revolution from above to form a technocratic imperial state. A copy found in Coutrot’s possession had been given to the authorities by his brother-in-law and partner in the family paper firm. <br><br>Coutrot, a small-time industrialist, had joined X-crise (X-c) soon after this forum on public affairs was launched in 1931 by young alumni of the École Polytechnique (nicknamed “L’X”), who looked to economic planning for solutions to the depression of the early 1930s. In 1933 this group began publishing a review, <i>X-Crise</i>, which lasted until 1939, and, early on, started referring to itself as the Centre polytechnicien d’études économiques (CPÉÉ). Coutrot played a leading role. <br><br>By the early 1930s, an X-crise network of persons later prominent during the Occupation was taking shape. Georges Soulès (Raymond Abellio), a member of the CPÉÉ, was also heading the more left-leaning Centre polytechnicien d’études collectivistes (CPÉC). The tandem of Robert Gibrat and Robert Loustau joined the Ordre Nouveau (ON) personalist movement to head its technical cell; there, they vainly tried to become the social think tank for Colonel François de La Rocque’s Croix de Feu and instead led a splinter group away from it. Gibrat became a director of the Parti Populaire Français in 1937–1938 and then Laval’s secretary of communications in 1942, inviting Loustau to work with him. By the late 1930s, X-crise, along with Coutrot’s parent initiatives, such as a Centre d’étude des problèmes humains, with Alexis Carrel supporting a planned rationalization of French society and with connections to the Banque Worms, had acquired great prestige. <br><br>The political vacuum left by the fallen regime in 1940 did, in fact, open new possibilities for the technocratic elites, which had grown restive under it, lending an appearance of truth to the rumors of a plot in 1941. Many high Vichy officials, especially under Admiral Darlan (including Paul Baudouin, René Belin, Jean Berthelot, Jean Bichelonne, Jean Borotra, Yves Bouthillier, Jacques Le Roy Ladurie, Jacques Rueff, and Alfred Sauvy), came from this milieu of technocrats, eager to modernize France’s economic infrastructure. Due to its continental scale, this vision led some of them (Jacques Barnaud, Pierre Pucheu, Jacques Benoist-Méchin, François Lehideux, and Paul Marion) to submit to Hitler through Otto Abetz in April 1941 a “Plan pour un Ordre Nouveau en France,” calling for full integration in a German-dominated Europe. It marked the apex of the modernist strand of state collaboration. <br><br>Suspicion of modernizing technocratic elites ran so deep in France that long after the war, both Left and Right continued to spread rumors of conspiracies. Paradoxically, whereas Vichy technocrats who looked to Germany were sometimes accused by rumormongers of Anglo-American orientation, the postwar innuendos were often directed against too pro-German a stance on the part of the technocratic modernizers. <br><br>P.

On 4 October 1941 the Pétain government issued the Labor Charter, based on a vague combination of Italian corporatism and Catholic socialism, which made both workers and employers members of the same unions and outlawed strikes and lockouts. Later in November a group of Christian unionists opposed to the Labor Charter issued a competing document, the <i>Manifeste du 15 novembre 1940</i>, which declared that French syndicalism was unalterably anticapitalist and independent from the state. It declared that French syndicalists could never accept anti-Semitism, religious persecutions, or privileges based on wealth. Throughout the Occupation, most workers gravitated toward one of these two positions. Some, led by Belin, accepted the Occupation and the Labor Charter. Others, led by Léon Jouhaux, a moderate arrested in 1942 and deported in 1943, urged a return to traditional syndicalism. <br><br>The liberation brought a transformation of labor policy.

Although postwar critics viewed these latter not only as important literarily but as in some way embodying what was best about France, more recent commentators have questioned how, under the scrutiny of censors (German for plays produced in private theaters, Vichy for state theaters), any work performed in occupied Paris could project a positive national image or communicate subversive, pro- Resistance messages. <br><br>The theatrical output during the Occupation years was an extension of what came immediately before. Yet a number of changes make Occupation plays and productions significantly different from those of the Third Republic. Plays were subject to censorship, Jews and other minorities were purged from the stage, as well as from backstage and auditorium; some talented theater personnel fled Paris and France; and much of the press criticism of the stage was now in the hands of collaborationists.<br><br>After the 1940 armistice, theaters reopened slowly during the summer. Autumn brought the Occupation’s first season (1940–1941), comprising largely revivals and frivolous comedies, which, because they ignored realities such as ration coupons, Robert Brasillach dubbed “<i>comédies sans tickets</i>.” Starting with <i>Pasteur </i>(July 1940), Sacha Guitry produced a four-year marathon of his own scripts at the Madeleine. In the first season, Jean Anouilh became popular through productions of plays written before the defeat: <i>Léocadia, Rendez-vous à Senlis, Bal des Voleurs</i>, and, later, <i>Eurydice </i>(produced 1941–1942) and <i>Antigone </i>(1944) brought still greater acclaim. Fascist mobs closed Jean Cocteau’s <i>La Machine à écrire </i>in April 1941. In addition to his work at the <i>Comédie Française</i>, Jean-Louis Barrault produced and starred in André Obey’s <i>Huit cents mètres </i>(July 1941) about the front-runner’s defeat in a footrace, performed at Roland-Garros Stadium. <br><br>As the Occupation wore on, Parisian audiences continued to patronize theaters in spite of curfews, Gestapo raids, and electrical shortages. Henry de Montherlant followed his successful <i>La Reine Morte </i>(1942–1943 at the <i>Comédie Franc ¸aise</i>) with <i>Fils de Personne </i>(1943–1944), one of the few Occupation dramas set during the Occupation. Sartre, who began writing plays while a prisoner of war (his <i>Bariona </i>was a stalag pageant performed Christmas 1940), wrote <i>Les Mouches </i>(produced in 1943 at the Sarah-Bernhardt Theater, renamed at the time because of the actress’ Jewish ancestry) and <i>Huis Clos </i>(1944). Albert Camus launched his playwriting career with <i>Le Malentendu </i>in 1944. Jean Giraudoux, who died before D-Day, wrote <i>Sodome et Gomorrhe </i>(1943–1944) as well as <i>L’Apollon de Bellac </i>and <i>La Folle de Chaillot</i>, both of which premiered after the war, and Claudel allowed Barrault to stage <i>Le Soulier de Satin </i>(1943–1944). Shortly before Paris was liberated, theaters closed, but soon afterward they reopened. <i>Huis Clos, Antigone</i>, and <i>Le Malentendu </i>resumed their runs. While critics tend to regard postwar theater as breaking with the past, many playwrights and plays from the Occupation went on to greater successes in France and abroad. Trying to depict the wartime Parisian theater world in <i>Le Dernier métro </i>(1980), François Truffaut emphasized its contradictions and ambiguities, perhaps best expressing the difficulties of later generations in coming to terms with this problematic era. <br><br>*S.

By 1936 he had become the national party’s secretary- general. His aim, he declared, was the creation of “a Soviet France.” His loyalty to Stalin was always absolute. In 1935, when the USSR reversed its policy and advocated a united front against fascism, he supported French rearmament. In 1939, after the Nazi–Soviet pact, he opposed the war, branding it as a struggle between “imperialist” powers. He demanded immediate peace. <br><br>Drafted in 1939, after Premier Édouard Daladier had outlawed the Communist Party on 26 September, Thorez deserted his regiment and fled to Brussels, where the exiled party had established temporary headquarters.

In August 1941, when the Soviet Union first contacted the Free French in London, it was proposed he go to Britain, but this was vetoed by General de Gaulle. In January 1944 he assured de Gaulle’s Moscow representative that his party had no intention of seizing power when France was liberated or in the reconstruction period.

After the dissolution of the PCF in September 1939, Tillon was sent by the party’s clandestine leadership to regroup the organization in Bordeaux, where his underground party publications, including the <i>Manifeste de Bordeaux </i>of 18 July 1940, went far beyond the confines of the PCF’s “imperialist war” line.

Tillon developed the FTP along military lines into a Resistance pseudoarmy on the Left, with local, regional, and national command structures for all its sections. He also fought to prevent its inclusion in the Forces françaises de l’intérieur under General Pierre Koenig and disputed the control of armed forces at the time of the liberation, when Tillon’s conception of the “national insurrection” as a popular revolutionary uprising put him at odds with the Gaullist representatives of the Provisional Government and his own party leadership, whom he later accused of betraying the working classes.

Files also provided details about date and place of birth, marital status, national identity card number, employment history, and any personal property declared. Domicile files proved especially useful in locating Jews to deport, because of color coding—white for foreigners, colors for French citizens—and detailed addresses, specifying floor and stairwell and location on the street or courtyard.

Although the Nazi specialist in Jewish affairs, Theodor Dannecker, demanded the establishment of the UGIF, it was actually the creation of Xavier Vallat, first head of the Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives, who wanted to maintain control of Jewish property. All Jews had to join the UGIF. Headed by André Baur in the occupied zone and Albert Lévy and, later, R. R.

In the southern zone, the UGIF preserved greater autonomy, kept material assistance flowing to indigent Jews, and eventually became a cover for limited Resistance activities. <br><br>Both branches of the UGIF have been the focus of controversy among historians of the Holocaust. Critics charge that its very existence provided a false sense of security for endangered Jews. Most damaging is the fact that records kept by the UGIF were available to authorities hunting Jews.

There were occasional efforts to improve relations, but these produced no lasting results. Franco–Soviet relations could not be extricated from French domestic politics and the deepening split between Right and Left. The Right exploited fear of the French Communist Party and communist revolution in France to overturn the Cartel des gauches in the 1920s and the Popular Front in the 1930s. <br><br>Advocates of improved relations with the Soviets, for example,Édouard Herriot, Georges Mandel, and Paul Reynaud, were motivated primarily by the desire to re-create an eastern counterweight to Germany. They argued that judgments about Soviet communism should not affect matters of French security. If France could ally with the “white tsar” before 1914, it could ally with the “red tsar,” Stalin, against Nazi Germany. <br><br>Most of the French Right rejected the Soviet alliance. Pierre Laval, who became French foreign minister in 1934, fearing offense to Germany and the spread of communist revolution in Europe, slowed a promising movement toward closer relations with the USSR. He signed the Franco–Soviet mutual assistance pact in 1935, but before he did, his officials reduced it to a meaningless scrap of paper. Parliamentary ratification did not occur until after the German reoccupation of the Rhineland in March 1936. In 1936–1938 the Soviet government pressed the French for military staff talks, but the government was divided, and the French general staff was opposed to closer relations. General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin’s instructions were clear: do not offend the Soviets but stall, stall, stall! <br><br>During the Munich crisis, the French government snubbed the USSR. Foreign minister Georges Bonnet distorted or concealed Soviet statements on willingness to support Czechoslovakia. Afterward, the Soviet government accused France of having failed even to secure its honor at Munich. In spite of French rebuffs and Soviet cynicism, there was a last chance before the war to conclude an Anglo–Franco–Soviet alliance. It occurred after the Nazi occupation of the remnant of Czechoslovakia (March 1939), but Bonnet and Édouard Daladier, while more favorable than before to a Soviet agreement, still hesitated and fell in behind the British, who wanted to go “very slowly.” The Soviet government matched Munich with perfidy of its own, signing the Nazi–Soviet nonaggression pact on August 1939. <br><br>Franco–Soviet relations went icy cold and came near to belligerency after the outbreak of the Soviet–Finnish war in November 1939. The French government seemed keener on fighting the USSR than on fighting Nazi Germany and planned to send troops to Finland and to bomb Soviet oil installations in the Caucasus. These imprudent ideas were cut short by the end of the Soviet–Finnish war in March 1940 and the French military debacle in May–June 1940. The Free French government in exile, after the German invasion of 1941, saw the virtue of improved relations with the USSR as a counterbalance to Britain and the United States. The Soviet government was supportive, though not to the point of offending its British and American allies. However, in 1943 the USSR recognized the Algiers government, and in December 1944 a Franco– Soviet mutual assistance pact was concluded. General de Gaulle had no illusions about Soviet political objectives in Europe and was concerned about the strength of the French Communist Party arising out of its important role in the Resistance movement. The resumption of Soviet-Western tensions in 1945 returned Franco–Soviet relations to the hostility of the interwar years. <br><br>*†M. J.

Although the Francophile American ambassador William C. Bullitt attempted to use his influence to get aid for France, President Franklin D. Roosevelt did little to help for fear of antagonizing his nation’s isolationists. Roosevelt believed that the 1940 defeat had made apparent the weakness of French society and ended its role as a major power. The American president hoped to limit the extent of French collaboration with the Germans, to undermine the influence of the communists, and to dismantle the French empire. Although the U.S. State Department argued for a restoration of French power, the president worked against it. <br><br>The United States initially chose to work with Vichy in the hope that it would be able to prevent German acquisition of France’s fleet and colonies. The Roosevelt administration continued this policy up to the November 1942 invasion of North Africa, when Vichy troops fired on the Americans. In order to end resistance, the Americans allowed Admiral Darlan, then in Algiers, to administer North Africa. Following Darlan’s assassination in December 1942, the United States helped place the ineffectual General Henri Giraud in power in North Africa and backed him in his competition with Charles de Gaulle for control of French colonial forces. <br><br>In early 1943 Roosevelt joined with British prime minister Winston Churchill, whose government backed de Gaulle, in arranging a rapprochement between the Free French leader and Giraud. Their organizations were merged in June with the creation of the Comité français de libération nationale (CFLN). De Gaulle’s increasing control over French forces disturbed American officials, who saw him as too unpredictable and too independent to be an appropriate instrument for their policies. Roosevelt, wishing to limit the influence of both de Gaulle and the communists, who comprised much of the Resistance, ordered General Dwight D. Eisenhower to exclude both from planning the Normandy invasion and from subsequent civil administration. Roosevelt favored instead a military government with the possible collaboration of the Pétain regime. Administration of France proved more than Eisenhower’s army could handle, and the Gaullists increasingly took charge over civil matters. Forced to choose between antipathy for de Gaulle and the possibility of a left-wing France, Roosevelt granted the CFLN, now transformed into a Provisional Government, de facto recognition in July 1944 and fully embraced it in October. The United States rearmed the French and allowed them to participate in the defeat of Germany. After the war, fear of the Soviet Union and economic self-interest led the Americans to help rebuild France’s economy and international stature. The United States allowed the French to take part in the occupation of Germany and to return to Indochina and most other parts of its old empire and backed its bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations’ Security Council. <br><br>*†H.

From November 1940 to late 1942 Uriage publications inspired many in Vichy and in the regional affiliates who remained particularly loyal to the “mother school.” Uriage was much admired by the Scouts, the Chantiers de la Jeunesse, the Compagnons de France, and Jeunesse et montagne for its “knightmonk,” the “new man.” Uriage protested German excesses, fought off rivals, protected some Jews, and trained elites (4,000 at Uriage alone) for the political culture that was to succeed liberal democracy: authoritarian, hierarchical, Scoutish, personalist, communitarian, and spiritual, with a significantly downsized role for communists, Jews, and Freemasons. Pierre Laval’s return to office, the occupation of the southern zone, and a power struggle over directing French youth, however, led to its closing at the end of 1942. <br><br>The milice then established its own <i>école des cadres </i>in the château under a mystical royalist who wanted holy war on communists and restoration of the king. The milice Uriage trained <i>cadres </i>and taught counterinsurgency tactics, until it was attacked by the Resistance on 5 July 1944. Meanwhile Segonzac’s original Uriage network, united in a secret order, tried to influence the <i>maquis</i>. With the liberation Beuve-Méry and company founded Le Monde, revivedÉditions du Seuil and <i>Esprit</i>, helped found the École Nationale d’Administration, François Mitterrand’s Socialist Party, the Federalist movement, Christian- Marxist dialogue, the Second Vatican Council, <i>tier-mondisme</i>, and the cause of a united Europe. <br><br>P.

Vallat’s political career was shaped in the mold of Charles Maurras’ movement, Action Française—militantly nationalist, Catholic, and authoritarian. A badly wounded war veteran in 1918, he was a right-wing parliamentarian before 1940. In March 1941 Pétain appointed Vallat head of the General Office for Jewish Affairs or Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives, charged with administering anti-Jewish policy and legislation. Committed to the elimination of Jews from French public life and to reducing their role in French society, Vallat stood for what he called “<i>antisémitisme d’état</i>.” This meant that anti-Semitic policy was to serve the interests of the French state, not the dictates of the Nazis. Implicit in his approach was the hope that the Germans would gradually withdraw from this field, leaving the task to the French alone. Vallat operated in a highly legalistic manner and in rare instances made exceptions favoring distinguished, French-born Jews. Anti- German as well as anti-Jewish, Vallat resisted an anti-Semitic policy that would materially aid the Reich. By the end of 1941 Vallat was losing credibility, both with his French colleagues and with the Germans. Notably, Vallat failed to replace German regulations in the occupied zone with French law; at the same time, Vallat appeared to the Germans as an irksome rival in the anti-Semitic field, prone to making legalistic distinctions and opposing extreme measures. The occupation authorities forced him out of office in March 1942, when their plans turned to the deportation and murder of the Jews. Sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1947, Vallat was released 2 years later. <br><br>*S.

The arrests resulted in the deportation of 12,884 individuals, most of whom never returned. Single persons and couples without children were sent to the Drancy internment camp immediately, while families with children were detained under deplorable conditions in the Vélodrome d’Hiver before being sent first to various internment camps in France and then to Auschwitz. The result of an agreement between René Bousquet, secretary-general of the Vichy police, and Carl Oberg, chief of the German police in Occupied France, the roundup of the “Vel d’Hiv” has become an important symbol of the complicity of the Vichy government in carrying out the Nazis’ Final Solution. The Germans would never have succeeded in rounding up so many individuals without the active assistance of the French police. <br><br>On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the roundup in 1992, the Committee of the Vélodrome d’Hiver asked President François Mitterrand to make a formal statement denouncing the crimes of the French State against the Jews.

The following year, Mitterrand announced a national day of mourning, designated as 16 July, for the victims of the racist and anti-Semitic persecutions committed “under the so-called government of the French State.” Mitterrand’s successor, Jacques Chirac, in a statement made during the ceremonies marking the 53rd anniversary of the roundup in 1995, acknowledged the responsibility of the French and of the French state in deporting Jews to the Nazi death camps. <br><br>É.

Despite occasional talk of moving to Paris, the Pétain government remained in Vichy until its demise with the 1944 liberation. General de Gaulle’s Provisional Government thereupon established itself in Paris. <br><br>With the June 1940 German advance threatening Paris, the government fled, first to Tours, then to Bordeaux, from where it concluded the armistice with Germany. Bordeaux, however, had been occupied by the Germans, and the government chose Vichy, a town that, unlike the larger of the then-unoccupied cities, was not in the political domain of any of the major leaders of the time. As a resort, Vichy also possessed a large number of hotels that could be requisitioned for government use. The population of the Vichy metropolitan area expanded from 30,000 to over 130,000 during the war, as politicians and bureaucrats streamed to the provisional capital. Government requisition of most of the large hotels, in addition to wartime travel restrictions, severely curtailed the spa trade and hurt the town’s tourism industry. <br><br>Because of its association with the government of Marshal Pétain and the policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany, the town of Vichy has been unable to fully restore its image, and its name evokes emotional responses unlike those of other French towns. As a symbol of betrayal, Vichy was denounced even during the war not only by the Free French but also by those for whom the Pétain government was insufficiently zealous in pursuing the National Revolution and collaboration with the New Order. Opprobrium for the name was such even outside France that a cookbook published in English in 1941 renamed the soup “Vichyssoise” “Crême Gauloise,” and in 1943 a New York restaurant listed it as “de Gaullesoise.” In September 1944, just after the liberation, the Municipal Council of Vichy requested that any allusion to the Vichy regime be stricken from the French language. Two months later, the council protested against what it called the undeserved opprobrium linking the town with the term “Vichy government.” <br><br>Since the war, the “Vichyssois,” nongovernment residents of the town who themselves suffered as much as others in France during the Occupation, have sometimes been identified with “Vichyistes,” who had either served in Pétain’s government or had ideological affinities with it. In 1959, General de Gaulle, newly installed as president of the Fifth Republic, in an attempt to restore the town’s good name, gave a speech there that ended with the cry of “<i>Vive Vichy</i>.” Periodic attempts by Pétainists to commemorate the marshal’s activities there during the Occupation, which in 1978 led to police intervention, however, kept the symbolic linkage fresh in public opinion. Meanwhile, Vichy suffered from a decline in spa visitors from a high of 129,600 in 1931, many of whom were military and colonial officials on leave, to as few as 19,009 in 1983. <br><br>By the late 1980s, however, increasing numbers of tourists were becoming interested in specific locations in the town of the various Occupation-era ministries and state functions. Yielding to a curiosity, which came largely from visiting Germans and Americans, the Tourism Office in 1987 created a “<i>sites vichyssois du régime de Pétain</i>“ (Pétain regime Vichy sites) circuit, after winning the assent of police and Resistance veterans’ organizations. In 1988, the historian Marc Ferro, by no means pro-Pétain, who was invited to speak in Vichy about his then-new biography of the marshal, was obliged to give his lecture across the Allier River because of suggestions that even to speak of Pétain in Vichy was a step toward his rehabilitation. On 26 August 1992, a temporary plaque was erected on the former Hôtel du Parc, which had housed the offices of Pétain and many of his key associates, commemorating the roundup of foreign Jews in the then-unoccupied zone exactly 50 years earlier. This plaque was made permanent in 1993. <br><br>In the 1990s, Vichy town leaders were still trying to restore the good name of their town. Its citizens were still coping with the opprobrium for a history that, as a local historian emphasized, had not been their fault. <br><br>S. Barcellini and A.

Under a German officer’s supervision, an ex-Foreign Legionnaire and member of the LVF commanded this “Charlemagne Division.” Despite its divisional status, it never reached more than brigade strength.

First and foremost, women were assigned the role of wife and “mother of the family.” Women’s work was denounced that interfered with their role in the education of children. In contradiction of the fact that since the spring of 1940 more than a million Frenchmen were being held prisoner in Germany, Vichy launched a vigorous campaign for a high birthrate. The “ideal” Frenchwoman was to renounce affectation (<i>coquetterie</i>) “to assume a simple life,” described as indispensable for the reconstruction of the country. In reality, many women had to shoulder new responsibilities, often as heads of families, managing farms and businesses in place of their imprisoned husbands. Because of shortages caused by the Occupation, the state, in the autumn of 1940, began imposing restrictions that impacted the lifestyles of everyone. As household managers, however, women were directly impacted by these measures. Formerly routine activities such as buying a coat or a pair of shoes for the children became extremely difficult. Each day, women had to spend time and energy managing ration cards, now necessary to obtain provisions, and wait in long lines. These lines became the places where news circulated, and a new space for social interaction among the generations, as all age groups were represented there. The hardships of daily life for women, especially those in the cities, led to increasing frustration and eventually opposition to the occupation and Vichy authorities. Tracts denouncing their conditions of life circulated within the lines. <br><br>As had occurred under the Old Regime (prior to the 1789 revolution), women began to agitate for change. Beginning in the summer of 1940, spontaneous demonstrations of housewives took place in front of town halls and local prefecture offices. Accompanied by their children, women demanded more bread and milk for their families. Riots erupted in the Paris suburbs and in southern France in reaction to the deplorable conditions. In the Var, for example, some 40 spontaneous protests against the lack of provisions occurred in front of empty store windows between January and May 1942. <br><br>Clearly, the government’s inability to solve the problems of daily life placed women in the forefront of an anti-Vichy turn in public opinion and brought them into the political field. <br><br>*†C.

Therefore, although such tasks carried risk (and numerous women were indeed deported, tortured, imprisoned, and executed for their efforts), the women’s activities were not always viewed as important. Because Resistance work was perceived as an extension of women’s “natural” role, their activities in the Resistance have been underestimated both by historians who have focused on organizations and armed military actions and sometimes by the women themselves. The contrasting image of André versus Clara Malraux is a case in point. <br><br>A conference on women in the Resistance organized by the Union des Femmes Françaises in 1975 marked a major turning point in such perceptions. In fact, sex stereotypes could be an advantage, instead of a handicap: the social invisibility of a female secretary, for example, made her clandestine activities equally invisible. Thus, Jeanne Berthomier was able to gather intelligence just by going to work at the Ministry of Public Works in Paris, while Paule Letty- Mouroux worked as a secretary in the Toulon naval offices in order to be able to report on Axis ships. One Allied intelligence victory, consisting of vital information about the German warship <i>Scharnhorst</i>, came from details let slip at a tea party attended by Yvonne Le Roux, an agent of the Johnny network. <br><br>Although much of what women did was commonplace, some women also took leadership roles: Lucie Aubrac participated in daring raids to free her husband, Raymond. Berthie Albrecht was a leader of the Combat movement; Marie-Louise Dissart was a leader of the Françoise network; Claude Gérard organized Combat’s Secret Army in the Dordogne; and Marie-Madeleine Fourcade (née Méric), headed the Alliance intelligence network, to name but a few. Women worked in all areas of Resistance. They helped repatriate downed pilots and other escapees; wrote for, printed, and distributed clandestine newspapers that boosted morale; gathered intelligence and smuggled it out of France (often involving radio operations and cryptography); and trained, organized, and led armed Resistance. Women participated in the Resistance for different reasons. Many were not motivated by political commitments such as communism or by ethnic affiliation with Jews but saw their actions as an extension of family roles or as part of the defense of country and home. Others did have political affiliations or were motivated by religious belief, as in the case of the “<i>jocistes</i>“ (Jeunesse Ouvrière Catholique, or JOC), which included a branch for women (JOCF). Noor Inayat Khan, shot at Dachau after being deported for Resistance activities as a radio operator, became the first woman Sufi saint. Women resisters came from every social class, from the aristocratic (Mary Lindell, the comtesse de Milleville, who organized the Marie Claire escape line), to the humble, such as sexagenarian Marie Louise Dissard, and from every walk of life, including the families of notable artists (both the ex-wife and the daughter of the painter Francis Picabia) and politicians (Charles de Gaulle’s sisterin- law Madeleine and his niece Geneviève). <br><br>*C.

case 940: $("div#commentary").html('<b>WOMEN, VICHY POLICIES REGARDING</b> were determined by rigid definitions of masculinity and femininity that underlay its search for national renovation. Vichy sought to remedy what it saw as the disorder and promiscuous spirit of <i>laisser aller </i>(everything goes) of the 1930s, which, it held, Frenchwomen had helped create. Women’s vanity, material concerns, and neglect of patriotic duty (bearing children) had contributed, according to Vichy, to France’s defeat. The government initiated a campaign to strengthen the family and promote births. <br><br>Married women working outside the home were urged to return to their homes. A law of October 1940 required married women employed by the public sector to quit their jobs. As the war progressed, the manpower shortage forced Vichy to reverse its policies and urge women to work outside the home. With so many Frenchmen abroad, Vichy was obliged to change the Napoleonic Code, which placed married women under their husband’s authority and considered them legally “incapacitated.” A September 1942 law eliminated married Frenchwomen’s legal incapacity (although the husband remained the legal head of the household until 1970). The Famille du Prisonnier agency, formed to help families, exercised paternalistic surveillance over prisoners’ wives, largely women of working-class background. <br><br>While Vichy made no effort to change the policy of equal schooling for the sexes, the absence of male teachers necessitated the introduction of mixed elementary classes. In March 1942 Vichy instituted compulsory home management instruction for girls; while male students received physical education. Girls could voluntarily attend one of 380 youth centers set up for them, in lieu of the obligatory work camps for young men of draft age. They received “professional” training, largely limited to sewing and similar activities. There were no women at Uriage, the best known of the 60 centers Vichy set up to train the future leaders of the nation; only 2 were designated for women interns. In most of its endeavors the Vichy government had difficulty reconciling ideology and policies regarding women with the realities of the Occupation. <br><br>C.

case 945: $("div#commentary").html('<b>YOUTH, VICHY POLICY,</b> a major part of Vichy’s effort to capture the imagination of, and discipline, French youth, concerned their activities beyond the classroom. The creation on 12 July 1940 of a Ministry of Family and Youth marked the first time that a French government devoted a cabinet post to this age group and provided ample funding. On 6 September 1940 the youth section of this ministry was transferred to the Secretariat général à la jeunesse (SGJ) in the Ministry of Education. On 25 September the fervent Catholic Georges Lamirand assumed leadership. He held this post until April 1942, when the incoming collaborationist minister of education Abel Bonnard replaced him with Georges Pelorson, whose failure to mobilize French youth for German victory resulted in the suppression of the SGJ on 31 December 1943. For the remaining Vichy period, youth affairs were assigned to a commission in the Ministry of Education.<br><br>Non-left-wing youth movements—Catholic, Scouting, and youth hostel—remained influential under Vichy. Many of Vichy’s most prominent youth leaders— for example, General Joseph de La Porte du Theil (head of the Chantiers de la Jeunesse) and Pierre Schaeffer (head of the Compagnons de France)— had earlier been in Scouting. Vichy supplied large subsidies, and Scout membership jumped from 42,000 in 1940 to 160,000 in 1944. Lamirand protected Jewish Scouting until he was removed from office; Bonnard, however, expelled Jews from all youth movements. Vichy strictly regulated the youth hostels (<i>auberges de jeunesse</i>) and then outlawed them in August 1943. <br><br>A telling measure of Vichy’s failure to politicize the youth in its favor is that French Scouting remained the largest youth group between 1940 and 1944. The second biggest, the Chantiers de la Jeunesse, established in July 1940 to replace conscription, claimed a membership of 100,000. The Compagnons de France, set up in 1940 to help youth under 20 uprooted by war and unemployment, numbered only 25,000 to 30,000. Other groups included Jeunesses nationales populaires, Jeunesse populaire française, Jeunesses francistes, Jeunes de l’Europe Nouvelle, Jeunes du Maréchal, Jeunesse de France et d’Outremer, Équipes et Cadres de la France Nouvelle, Jeune Legion, Camarades de la Route, Maisons de jeunes, Équipes nationales, Les Campeurs Français, and Jeune France. These groups were largely either youth affiliates of the Paris-based collaborationist parties or independent protofascist organizations and had memberships ranging between 3,000 and 6,000. In addition, the Vichy government set up 60 schools to train leaders, the school at Uriage being the most famous. This labyrinthine set of organizations, however, is but one indication of Vichy’s failure to develop a coherent youth policy. Pétain, for example, dissolved the organization created in his honor—the <i>Jeunes du Maréchal</i>—when its members displayed Nazi leanings. Within the Vichy inner circle, factions battled constantly. Catholics asserted the autonomy of their own organizations, grouped under the Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Française, fearing that a single, state-controlled youth movement (such as proposed by Parisian collaborationists Marcel Déat and Jacques Doriot) would swallow their own. The Germans, in keeping with their divide-and-rule policy, opposed a single, all-powerful French youth movement, while at the same time imposing the Hitler Youth movement in Alsace.<br><br>Between 1940 and 1942, Vichy organizations enlisted one-third of the youth in the unoccupied zone. The remaining two-thirds were never organized. By the time of the liberation, Vichy’s youth legions had either shifted to the Resistance or dissolved into apathy. Nevertheless, the spirit of the leadership school at Uriage, exemplified by such figures as Hubert Beuve-Méry, later founder of Le Monde, had much influence in the postwar era. <br><br>B.

case 950: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ZONES.</b> With the signing of the June 1940 armistices with Germany and Italy, France was partitioned into several administrative zones, while Alsace and Lorraine were annexed outright by Germany. A Demarcation Line established the most basic fracture in France, into a northern zone, occupied by Germany, and an unoccupied southern, sometimes called the “free” zone. The line stretched across France from the Atlantic coast south of Bordeaux, up to Vierzon, southeast to Moulins, north to Chalon-sur-Saône, east through Dole, and south to Geneva. Moulins was established as the main station for crossing the line, allowed only for those bearing an officially issued <i>laissez-passer</i>. Some 24 million inhabitants lived in the occupied zone; 16 million in the unoccupied zone. The rich coal regions of the north and France’s major industrial sectors in Paris fell under German control in the occupied zone, as did also the industrial wealth of Alsace and Lorraine. Italy occupied several southeastern departments near the Franco–Italian border. <br><br>France’s capital was relocated in Vichy, in the unoccupied zone, due south of Moulins. Although Vichy was theoretically the capital of all of France, the German occupation authorities severely limited its authority outside the unoccupied zone. In November 1942, following the Allied landings in French North Africa, the Germans broke the armistice agreement and overran the “free” zone, applying a more direct hand in Vichy affairs. Italy’s occupation zone was extended to the Rhône River. The overturning of Mussolini’s government in the summer of 1943 brought German occupation to the former Italian zone. <br><br>The Germans subdivided the occupied zone into “forbidden” and “reserved” zones. Most of the Atlantic seaboard and the coastline of the channel as well as the Ardennes forest fell under the “forbidden” category. In the northeast near the Ardennes, the Germans expelled most French civilians in order to use the area as a rocket-testing location but also to settle some of the farm areas with Germans under a project titled “Ostland.” In addition, the German command defined beach zones stretching from Brittany to Normandy as off-limits. The liberation of France in 1944 reunited the various zones under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government in Paris.<br><br>H. Michel, <i>Paris allemand </i>(Paris, 1964); J. F.

There are many bibliographical sources for World War II France. One of the best is
Donna Evleth, ed., <i>France under the German Occupation, 1940–1944, An Annotated
Bibliography </i>(Westport, CT, 1991). To keep up with the growing literature in this field,
the reader should consult the <i>Bibliographie Annuelle de l’Histoire de France</i>, which lists
both books and articles in English and other languages as well as French. The <I>BAHF</i>
issue for 1994 shows 761 titles. The list below is selected, oriented to more recent
literature and works in English. It is based mainly on the bibliographical notices of the
articles in this <i>Historical Dictionary</i>. Some of the items listed relate to more than one
