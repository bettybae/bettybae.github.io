In Estonia and Latvia, where national movements seized the opportunity of the Bolshevik coup to declare their independence, the legitimacy of the new national assemblies was swiftly called into question.<sup>18</sup> The situation became more confusing in the spring when a German offensive led to the occupation of all of Latvia, Estonia, Belorussia, and Ukraine, only to be reversed when the German war effort collapsed in November that year and was followed by a Red Army advance toward Minsk and Vilnius.<sup>19</sup> In Poland, too, the attempt to restore a powerful nation-state in the heart of Europe encountered severe problems: by the spring of 1919, Josef Pilsudki’s reorganized Polish armed forces were engaged on four fronts: inUpper Silesia against strong German volunteer forces, in Teschen/Teshyn against the Czechs, in Galicia against Ukrainian forces, and against the Soviets threatening to invade from the West.<sup>20</sup><br><br><sup>17</sup> To what extent the late European empires were indeed “people’s prisons” remains a controversial question to this day—recent scholarship has emphasized the Habsburg empire in particular as an evolving civil society rather than as a decrepit polity doomed to dissolution by the forces of centrifugal nationalism.

<b>Abstract</b>

<br><blockquote>The First World War is hardly a neglected subject of historical research, yet most of these histories proceed within two main assumptions: that the war began 
with the sounding of the “guns of August” in 1914 and ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918; and that the war was primarily one of nation-states, and largely a European affair. Both 
assumptions have dominated and defined the historiography of the Great War for decades. While the literature based on these assumptions has produced excellent results and vastly improved our 
knowledge of the causes and consequences of that conflict, this volume proceeds from two premises that diverge from these assumptions. The first, that it pays to examine the Great War within 
a frame both longer (temporally) and wider (spatially) than it typically is. The second, that we should see the war not merely as a war between nation-states, but as a war of empires.</blockquote>

<br><b>Introduction</b>

<br><br>The First World War formally ended in late 1918 with an Allied victory. In its wake, three vast and centuries-old land empires—the Ottoman, Habsburg, and Romanov empires—vanished from
 the map. A fourth—the Hohenzollern Empire, which had become a major land empire in the last year of the war when it occupied enormous territories in East Central Europe—was significantly 
 reduced in size, stripped of its overseas colonies, and transformed into a parliamentary democracy. The victorious West European empires, despite their significant territorial gains at the 
 Paris Peace Conference, were not unaffected by the cataclysm of war either: Ireland gained independence after a bloody guerilla war against British forces, while, in Egypt, India, Iraq, 
 Afghanistan, and Burma, London responded to unrest with considerable force. France fought back resistance to its imperial ambitions in Algeria, Syria, Indo-China, and Morocco. Even further 
 from the main theaters of the Great War, Japan did the same in Korea<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">.</a> 
 
 <br><br>Benito Mussolini famously commented on the disintegration of the great European land empires and the 
 new challenges confronting the blue-water empires with a surprisingly nervous reference: neither the fall of ancient Rome nor the defeat of Napoleon, he insisted in an article for <i>Il 
 Popolo d’Italia</i>, could compare in its impact on history to the current reshuffling of Europe’s political map. “The whole earth trembles. All continents are riven by the same crisis. 
 There is not a single part of the planet […] which is not shaken by the cyclone. In old Europe, men disappear, systems break, 
 institutions collapse<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">.</a>”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a>
 
 <br><br>For once, Mussolini had a point. For centuries, European history, and indeed the history of the world, had been a history of empires, both within the European continent and in terms 
 of maritime exploration, expansion, and conquest of overseas territories. Imperial players such as the United States, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire had carved out their own respective spheres 
 of influence and colonial domination. At the peak of such unprecedented imperial expansion, on the eve of the Great War, much of the land mass of the inhabited world was divided into formal 
 empires or economically dependent territories. That world unraveled dramatically in the twentieth century, as these vast empires either collapsed or came under great strain in the cataclysm of 
 the First World War<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">.</a> 
 
 <br><br><b>(p.2)</b> Neither the First World War nor its effects on Europe’s political landscape are neglected subjects of historical research. Yet—understandably perhaps, 
 given the imprint of the fighting on Western Europe—most of the literature produced since 1918 has focused on the events on the Western Front and their impact on metropolitan Britain, France,
 and Germany. Most of these histories are framed within two “classic” assumptions: first, that the war began with the sounding of the “guns of August” in 1914 and ended with the Armistice of 
 11 November 1918 and, second, that the war was primarily one of nation states and that it was largely a European affair. Meanwhile, ethnic minorities, imperial troops, and East European or 
 non-European theaters of fighting, conscription, and upheaval have remained at best sideshows in general history accounts of war and peace on the Western 
 Front<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>

 <br><br>Both of these assumptions have dominated and defined the Western historiography of the Great War for decades. And, while the literature based on these assumptions has produced many 
 valuable insights into the causes and consequences of that conflict, this book seeks to expand the canvas on which the history of the Great War is written by proceeding from two premises that 
 diverge from these assumptions. The first premise is that it pays to examine the war within a frame that is both longer (temporally) and wider (spatially) than is typical. The focus on the 
 period between August 1914 and November 1918 makes more sense for the victorious Western Front powers (notably Britain and France) than it does for much of central-eastern and south-eastern 
 Europe or for those colonial troops whose demobilization did not begin in November 1918. The paroxysm of 1914–18 was the epicentre of a cycle of armed imperial conflict that in some parts of 
 Europe began in 1911, with the Italian attack on territories in Northern Africa and the Mediterranean previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire, and the Balkan Wars, which broke out the 
 following year.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a>
 Moreover, the massive waves of violence triggered by imperial collapse continued until 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne defined the territory of the new Turkish Republic and 
 ended Greek territorial ambitions in Asia Minor with the largest forced exchange of populations in history until the Second World War.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> The end of the Irish Civil War in the same year, the 
 restoration of a measure of equilibrium in Germany after the end of the Franco-Belgian occupation <b>(p.3)</b> of the Ruhr, the stabilization of the Bolshevik regime in Russia with its 
 decisive victory in that bloody civil war and the confirmation of the New Economic Policy on Lenin’s death in 1924, and the reconfiguration of power relations in East Asia at the Washington 
 Conference two years earlier were all further indications that the cycle of violence, for the time being, had run its course<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">.</a>
 
 <br><br>The second contention of this book is that we should see the First World War not merely as a war between European nation states, but primarily as a war of multi-ethnic, global empires.
 Charles Maier has defined empires as supra-national entities characterized “by size, by ethnic hierarchization, and by a regime that centralizes power but enlists diverse social and/or ethnic 
 elites in its management.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
 In this volume we use “empire” as an inclusive and open concept that describes a polity whose territories and populations are arranged and governed hierarchically 
 in relation to the imperial center, which is precisely how most of the polities discussed in this volume viewed themselves at the time. Thinking about the Great War as a war of empires rather 
 than of nation states allows us to see, as many of the chapters that follow show, how the various contenders mobilized, deployed, and demobilized different imperial populations in 
 differential ways and why this mattered both to the general history of the war and to the mobilized groups themselves. Moreover, if we take the conflict seriously as a <i>world</i> war, we 
 must, a century after the event, adopt a perspective that does justice more fully to the millions of imperial subjects called upon to defend their imperial governments’ interest, to theaters 
 of war that lay far beyond Europe including in Asia and Africa and, more generally, to the wartime roles and experiences of innumerable peoples from outside the European 
 continent<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a>

 <br><br>The mobilization of millions of imperial subjects on both sides of the conflict proved essential for all combatant states, from Germany to the Ottoman, Habsburg, and Romanov empires 
 and, of course, the Entente powers. Indian, African, Canadian, and Australian soldiers among others all served on the Western Front, as well as in a range of ancillary theaters, and hundreds 
 of thousands of them died. Non-combatant laborers—notably from China—also proved vital to the conduct of the war, as did the involvement of the Japanese Empire, which, as Frederick Dickinson 
 shows in his chapter, used the war as an opportunity not only to try to penetrate further into China but also to stage an extensive occupation of Siberia that lasted until 1922. The 
 involvement of imperial troops, Chinese laborers, and others in the Great War turned what had begun primarily as a European conflict into a world war and marks what has long appeared as 
 mainly a conflict between states as an imperial war. Fighting also took place outside Europe—from Siberia and East Asia to the Middle East, from the South Pacific to the protracted campaigns 
 <b>(p.4)</b> in East Africa. The impact of the war was profoundly felt by hundreds of millions living across the imperial world, as the war brought conscription, occupation, inflation, and 
 economic dislocation, while also in many instances kindling new opportunities, ideas, plans, and hopes<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">.</a>
 
 <br><br>It is only when the war is viewed though this expansive set of lenses that its 
 scope, significance, and implications can be grasped in their fullest sense. Viewing the Great War as a war for imperial survival and expansion helps to place the conflict into a broader 
 spatial and chronological context, one that began with the 1911 Italian invasion of Ottoman territories in North Africa and the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 and that launched a process of imperial 
 decline, which would ultimately lead to the violent collapse of a global order based on territorial empires and replace it by one predicated on the nation state as the only internationally 
 legitimate form of political organization<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">.</a>
 
 <br><br>The imperial frame also makes it easier to see that the mass violence of war did not end with the Armistice of 1918 and to see how the 
 violence that preceded August 1914 and continued after November 1918 was in fact part of the same process of the realignment of global patterns of power and legitimacy. Large-scale violent 
 conflict continued for years after 1918, as the Great War destroyed the dynastic empires of Russia, Austria–Hungary, and Ottoman Turkey and created a heavily contested border in Germany’s 
 East, thereby leaving “shatter zones,” or large tracts of territory where the disappearance of frontiers created spaces without order or clear state 
 authority.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a>
 Revolutionary regimes came to 
 power and then fell amidst great violence in the East and Central European shatter zones of the dynastic land empires. The massive carnage of the Russian civil war continued unabated, as did 
 a number of large-scale but hitherto little studied relief projects. And, of course, civil war accompanied by massacres and population transfer of unprecedented scope raged in Anatolia. The 
 large-scale violence did not come to an end until the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which stabilized, at least temporarily, the post-imperial conflict in south-east Europe and Asia 
 Minor<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">.</a>
 
 <br><br>But the conflict had dealt a substantial blow even to those empires that emerged victorious. As early as the spring of 1919 Britain was facing major civil unrest in Egypt and the 
 Punjab. By May, British forces were engaged in the opening stages of the Third Afghan War, and Ireland was beginning its descent into an extended period of insurgency that would lead to the 
 establishment of the Irish Free State. The British Empire deployed extreme and widespread violence, including civilian massacres and aerial bombardment to quell revolts in Ireland, India, 
 Iraq, and <b>(p.5)</b> elsewhere, and they were not alone in doing so. The French fought viciously to beat back fierce resistance to their expanding rule in the Levant and Indochina; the 
 Japanese struggled to contain challenges to their empire on the Korean peninsula, even as they sought to expand their influence deep into Siberia. Indeed, the entire edifice of the imperial 
 world order was convulsing violently in the aftermath of the Armistice even as it reached its greatest territorial extent. The organized mass violence of the war had not ended; it had only 
 shifted its modes and focal points<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">.</a>

 <br><br><b>Mobilizing Empires for War</b>

 <br><br>When Europe went to war in 1914, it was—and had been for centuries—a continent dominated by dynastic empires with vast territorial possessions both within and outside the continent. 
 When the cataclysm of industrial warfare ended, three of these empires had collapsed and faced territorial dissolution, while others were confronted with major problems of what Paul Kennedy 
 called “imperial overstretch.” Yet, some of the contestants had faced imperial decline for much longer, notably the Ottoman Empire, under strain since the Eastern Crisis of the 1870s. Drawing 
 on the opportunities provided by the Ottomans’ inability to prevent gradual disintegration, Italy—a newcomer on the imperial stage—declared war on the Ottomans in September 1911. Originally 
 conceived as a war to occupy Ottoman provinces in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, in the tradition of nineteenth-century European colonial conquests, the Italian campaign against the Ottoman 
 forces quickly escalated in intensity, ambition, and geographical scope, fueling racial and religious hatred around the eastern Mediterranean and 
 Balkans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>

 <br><br>Just over a year later, on 17 October 1912, Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria declared war on the Ottoman Empire and achieved a decisive victory.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> 
 The Balkan Wars had an 
 immediate knock-on effect. When the Balkan League began its war against the Ottoman Empire, challenging the status quo in the Balkans, the Danube Monarchy found itself forced to rethink its 
 Balkan policy. Serbia was the most victorious state with the greatest territorial expansion in both Balkan Wars. After the defeat and withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire from Europe, 
 Austria–Hungary, a multinational state with a slight Slav majority, was concerned that it was the next “sick man” and a target of a future Serbian attack, which helps to explain Vienna’s 
 uncompromising position in the July crisis of 1914.
 
 <br><br>As soon as a wider European war was deemed inevitable, it was clear that all combatants would call upon their imperial subjects to take up arms. For the entire course of the Great War 
 on the Eastern Front, the imperial belligerents fought with multi-ethnic armies in colonized spaces. In August 1914, Russia conducted a general mobilization, calling on reservists to join the 
 army in the west. The composition <b>(p.6)</b> of the army roughly reflected the country’s multi-ethnic make-up. If the ethnic Russian population in the empire in 1897 was about 44 percent of 
 the overall population, Russians contributed an estimated 50 percent (75 percent if one adds together Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians) of the vast imperial army, with over 11 million 
 men under arms in 1917, while the rest came from the more than 150 ethnic groups of often less than 5 million people inhabiting the territories of the Romanov Empire.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a>
 
 <br><br>Russia’s principal opponent on the Southern Front, the Ottoman Empire, also relied heavily on the conscription of ethnic and religious minorities, as Mustafa Aksakal demonstrates in 
 his chapter. While the commonly used figure of Arab conscripts is 300,000 (or 10 percent of the total number of men mobilized), more recent estimates suggest that recruits from the empire’s 
 Arabic-speaking provinces may have comprised over 26 percent. Furthermore, of the 49,238 men who deserted in Aydın province between August 1914 and June 1916, about 59 percent were Muslim and 
 41 percent non-Muslim, indicating that the Ottomans drew heavily on their Christian minorities (mainly Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a>
 Over the course of the war of 1914, however, the state 
 increasingly questioned the loyalty of the empire’s non-Muslim and non-Turkish populations, suppressed them violently, and thereby ended the empire’s viability.
 
 <br><br>The war also reinforced inter-ethnic tensions in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the subject of Peter Haslinger’s contribution to this volume and arguably the most ethnically diverse of 
 the land empires, with more than ten ethno-linguistic communities living within its borders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
 The Habsburg army drafted its soldiers from all of these communities, which, according to the 
 official census of 1910 contained 23% German-speakers, nearly 20% Hungarians, 16% Czechs or Slovaks, almost 10% Poles, and nearly 9% Serbs, Croats, or Bosnians, 8% Ukrainians, 6% Romanians, 
 and a whole host of smaller ethnic communities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>

 <br><br>Even the German Imperial Army—seemingly the most ethnically homogenous of all combatants—drew heavily on the country’s substantial 
 ethnic and religious minorities, notably those from the borderlands (even if they were rarely used as soldiers in the borderlands they originated from).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a>
 Excluding the German use of Askaris 
 in Africa and General Lettow-Vorbeck’s African carriers (which were a separate force), some 10 percent of the German army was recruited from the minorities, including some 850,000 Poles (6 
 percent of total manpower)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>, </b>(p.7)</b> 400,000–500,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers (3–4 percent)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a>
, some 100,000 Jews (&lt;1 percent)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a>, as well as 26,000 Danes<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> and a small number of 
 Serbs, Sinti, and Roma.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a>
 The German case, discussed in Heather Jones’s chapter, illustrates that there was more than one way to be an empire: it was the only one of the combatants to 
 define itself as both a European land empire, significantly enlarged after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and an overseas empire with global ambitions.
 
 <br><br>As the European land empires mobilized their multi-ethnic imperial troops in early August 1914, the British and French also called upon their empires to assist in the war effort. In 
 1914, London and Paris controlled the two largest colonial empires in the world, and they would draw on them extensively during the war for both human and material resources. For France, the 
 empire played an integral role in its efforts and ability to fight a war against Germany. The war was a testing ground for General Mangin’s plea for the mobilization of “la force noire,” a 
 large reserve of African troops to counter France’s demographic disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>
 In addition to the 90,000 <i>troupes indigènes</i> already under arms when the war started, 
 France recruited between 1914 and 1918 nearly 500,000 colonial troops, including 166,000 West Africans, 46,000 Madagascans, 50,000 Indochinese (plus an additional 50,000 laborers from this 
 French colony), 140,000 Algerians, 47,000 Tunisians, and 24,300 Moroccans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Most 
 of these French colonial troops served in Europe.
 
 <br><br>As Richard Fogarty demonstrates in his chapter, mobilization of imperial resources included not only manpower reserves but also the drawing on the economic and financial resources of 
 the colonies. And the total contribution—measured in tons of goods, francs, laborers, and soldiers—loomed even larger in the French imagination than mere numbers would suggest. In the 
 cultural mobilization that was so important in this all-consuming conflict, the colonies were especially visible, and the war also left deep imprints upon the empire itself and its peoples. 
 In the end, although it was the Second World War that truly inaugurated the process of decolonization, this earlier war played a significant role in destabilizing French rule in its overseas 
 possessions, and in undermining the colonial relationships upon which that rule rested.
 
 <br><br><b>(p.8)</b> The same applies to the British Empire, although in a more uneven way, as the two chapters by Bill Nasson and Stephen Garton suggest. Garton’s chapter focuses on those 
 parts of the empire that contributed the most considerable manpower, financial, and material resources to the war effort: the Dominions, and particularly Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, 
 as well as Ireland and India (the latter proving a particularly rich source of manpower, as approximately 1.4 million men were enlisted up to December 1919). The chapter examines the impact 
 and consequences of participation on these parts of the empire and explores the social, political, and cultural tensions that emerged around mobilization for war, tracing the gradual 
 transition from “innocent enthusiasm” to increasing ambivalence and even outright resistance to the war effort.
 
 <br><br>Britain’s initial mobilization of African troops, by contrast, was relatively modest, and it led to somewhat different results, as Bill Nasson’s chapter attests. Following the pre-war 
 template laid out by the Committee of Imperial Defence, governors and their military advisors looked first to the security of their own colonies and then to seizing Germany’s African ports 
 and wireless stations in Togoland (Togo), Kamerun (Cameroon), German South-West Africa (Namibia), and German East Africa (Tanzania). The initial focus of British colonial mobilization was to 
 raise sufficient local forces to seize the coastal regions of German Africa as rapidly as possible. This appeared to be a relatively easy proposition in southern Africa, where Louis Botha, 
 the first Prime Minister of the new Union of South Africa, gladly accepted London’s “invitation” to seize strategic points in German South-West Africa in September 1914.
 
 <br><br>But the often arbitrary recruitment practices in British Africa led to at times violent resistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> In South Africa, too, resistance flared up, spurred by the deep resentment that 
 many Afrikaners still felt towards the British Empire after the Boer Wars.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> The vast majority of Africans recruited during the First 
 World War were not, however, combat troops. Instead, they served as laborers or carriers in the African theater of war. Up to 200,000 of them died (mostly as a result of diseases such as 
 Malaria and the most fatal of wartime illnesses, dysentery, rather than combat), and among the laborers serving in Africa the death rates may have been as high as 20 
 percent.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>

 <br><br>Matters were somewhat more straightforward with regards to the white settler dominions. When London declared war in 1914, it did not see fit to consult Dominion prime ministers. Yet, 
 most dominion leaders and commentators enthusiastically embraced the call to arms, pledging to support Britain down to the “last man and the <b>(p.9)</b> last shilling” or in Canada the “last 
 dollar.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Newfoundland contributed some 1.3 million men to the British 
 war effort.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> In proportionate terms, New Zealand made one of the 
 largest contributions in the British Empire (with 5 percent of its men aged 15–49 killed), while Australia (with 300,000 troops sent overseas, of whom 60,000 were killed and 150,000 returned 
 wounded, disabled, ill, and psychologically scarred) suffered a casualty rate of nearly two-thirds—the highest of any force serving the Allies.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>
 
 <br><br>Mobilization in a colonial context was delicate. Though the British Empire had regularly used colonial troops in the imperial realm, it had not done so in Europe against other white 
 people. After all, a war fought on both sides with native auxiliaries was likely to undermine the very principle on which colonialism rested: the notion of white racial superiority. If a 
 “colored” man was trained to kill other Europeans, what guarantee was there that he would not one day attack his own colonial masters? However, after the heavy casualties suffered by the 
 British Expeditionary Corps in August 1914, two Indian divisions were diverted to France. The French, for their part, had to persuade the men of North Africa to make war on Germany, a country 
 with which they had no quarrel, in defense of an empire that had reduced them to second-class citizens in their own homelands. The task was made all the more difficult by German propaganda 
 that played on Islamic loyalties to turn the Muslims of North Africa against the French.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> Still, in France imperial troops were used in 
 Europe right from the start. The North African troops were dispatched to the Belgian frontier, where they first saw battle in Charleroi on 21 August. Battalions of 1,200 infantrymen were cut down to less than 500 in a single day’s 
 fighting—initial casualty rates ran to 60 percent dead and wounded. In all, some 6,500 North African soldiers died between August and December 1914 alone, and thousands more 
 were wounded<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a>

 <br><br>Imperial mobilization became ever more central to the Allies’ war effort from 1915 onwards. After losing decisive battles against the Germans on the Eastern Front, a decree of 25 June 
 1916 called upon previously exempt men from Central Asia to serve in labor battalions, sparking unrest and resistance throughout the region. For Britain, too, mobilizing imperial manpower 
 became a greater strategic necessity. Having suffered nearly half a million casualties at the Battle of the <b>(p.10)</b> Somme in 1916, and faced with imperial commitments stretching from 
 India to Mesopotamia to the Dardanelles, the coalition government in London broke with the revered English tradition of voluntary military service and introduced universal conscription in 
 Britain in March 1916. London’s attempt to convince Ireland and the self-governing white dominions to follow suit sparked intensive political controversy and met with limited success. Under 
 these circumstances, raising more troops became paramount, which led imperial strategists to reconsider their views on the military value of subject Africans. In many of the colonies, there 
 was a political calculation on the part of those who chose to enlist or those who encouraged others to do so. Leaders of the Indian National Congress or many “Home Rulers” in Ireland supported
 the war in the hope of greater political autonomy, perhaps even national independence. Mohandas K. Gandhi, who returned to India in 1915 from his long sojourn in South Africa, famously 
 campaigned to recruit his fellow Indians to fight for the empire, in the hope that their participation in the imperial war effort would place India within the imperial structure on a par with 
 the white dominions and advance its claim for home rule. London encouraged this line of thinking, making wartime promises of a greater participation of Indians in their own 
 government<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> This 
 strategy of promising some measure of post-war self-determination in exchange for wartime support was applied elsewhere as well, most famously perhaps in the incompatible wartime promises made
 to Arabs and Jews over the disposition of Ottoman Palestine.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a><br><br>Nor was this logic limited to formal colonial 
 contexts. As Xu Guoqi shows in his chapter, newly republican China also came
 to see support for the Allied war effort as the price for a seat at the table in the post-war settlement and a place as an equal within international society. Beginning in summer 1915, Beijing
 allowed the Allies to recruit as many as 140,000 Chinese laborers to the European front, and in 1917, despite weakness and internal division, the Chinese Republic officially joined the war on 
 the Allied side. In this respect, the war proved a great disappointment for many who had hoped to parlay support for the Allied war effort into advances in claims for self-government. This 
 result set the stage of anti-colonial conflict for decades to come, not least in making the radical promises of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia all the more attractive for those seeking to 
 throw off the colonial yoke<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">.</a>
 
 <br><br><b>Dismantling Empires, Expanding Empires</b>
 
 <br><br>The announcement of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 augured a new world of sharp contradictions. Empires both disintegrated and 
 expanded, and, while violence ended on the Western Front and in some other theaters, it continued unabated and sometimes even intensified elsewhere. This was notably the case in the <b>(p.11)
 </b> former lands of the Russian Empire, which, as Joshua Sanborn’s chapter argues, experienced a moment of “decolonization” when the imperial structure, flawed but relatively stable in 1914, 
 collapsed as a result of the Great War. The crisis of empire began in 1914, when the imposition of martial law in the borderlands crippled governmental authority and led to profound insecurity
 for the many different ethnic groups living in these war zones, and intensified with the military defeats of 1915 and the massive anti-colonial rebellion that rocked all of tsarist Central 
 Asia the following year, and as the political elites turned on one another. Decolonization culminated in the revolutionary year of 1917. New plans for the structure of the state proliferated, 
 eventually leading to movements for autonomy and/or independence in all of the imperial borderlands<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">.</a>
 
 <br><br>As a consequence of imperial collapse and the rise and clash of violent Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik movements, an extensive arc of post-war violence stretched from Finland and the 
 Baltic States through Russia and Ukraine, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Germany, all the way through the Balkans into Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East, and even Czechoslovakia, long 
 thought to be an island of peace, experienced significant inter-ethnic tensions and violence<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">.</a> The death toll of the period between the Great War’s official end in 1918 and the Treaty of 
 Lausanne in 1923 was extraordinary: including those killed in the Russian Civil War<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">.</a> well over four million people lost their lives as a result of civil wars or inter-ethnic struggles, not 
 counting the millions of expellees and refugees that fled the havoc unleashed in Eastern and Central Europe<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a>
 
 <br><br>In imperial domains beyond Europe post-war violence, while not nearly as massive as it was on the Continent, was nevertheless widespread<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">.</a> Indeed, the years immediately after the war 
 saw widespread upheaval across much of the Middle East and Asia. In Egypt, the “1919 Revolution” that erupted against British influence in the spring following the Armistice included mass 
 street protests in the cities and widespread acts of sabotage in rural areas, targeting telegraph lines and other symbols of imperial authority. Egyptian nationalists, who saw the peace 
 conference as an opportunity to be rid of British meddling, grew frustrated as their hopes for a hearing evaporated and mobilized forcefully against the British presence. Though London managed
 to stave off the internationalization of the Egyptian question, the continuing instability eventually led it to give Egypt its independence unilaterally in 1922, while keeping for itself the 
 “core interests” of defence and the Suez Canal. But Egyptian nationalists grew increasingly assertive in the post-war years, and a tense relationship persisted until the final liquidation of 
 British power in Egypt in 1956<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a>
 
 <br><br>In India, too, the spring of 1919 saw widespread disturbances, as Gandhi and others mobilized Indians against Westminster’s decision to extend wartime emergency measures into 
 peacetime, an imperial effort to stem resistance that begat greater resistance still. The killing of hundreds of unarmed protesters who <b>(p.12)</b> broke curfew in the Panjabi city of 
 Amritsar became a rallying cry and a focal point of nationalist resistance. As in Egypt, the British authorities sought to play on the divisions among Indians to retain their influence for a 
 while longer, but they could not restore the illusion of imperial harmony and legitimacy that had surrounded the Delhi Durbar of 1911, held to mark the coronation of George V as the sovereign 
 of India. When the Indian National Congress renounced the pursuit of Dominion status and adopted independence as its official goal in 1930, it brought to the center of politics a position 
 that, until 1914, had been articulated only on the far margins of Indian political discourse<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a>
 
 <br><br>As Britain’s imperial managers strained to restore order and contain cascading crises across their old domains, they also struggled to shape and control the new territories they had 
 acquired as a result of the war, especially those detached from the defunct Ottoman Empire and awarded to the British Empire under the novel arrangement of the League of Nations mandate. The 
 question of Palestine seemed—for the time being—relatively manageable, but efforts to reconcile the wartime commitments made to London’s French and Arab allies and the concurrent need to find 
 an instrument of control for the newly acquired, oil-rich mandate territory of Iraq, led to the ingenious idea of installing the Hijazi prince Faysal ibn Husayn, recently run out of his 
 homeland by the rival House of Sa’ud and shortly thereafter out of Syria by the French, as monarch over Mesopotamia. That move, along with the brutal application of newly developed British 
 airpower to suppress restive tribal revolts, managed to stabilize the situation in the mandate by the early 1920s, at least for a time<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a>
 
 <br><br>The French mandates proved even more troublesome in the interwar period, as did other parts of the French Empire: serious uprisings against French colonial rule in the interwar period 
 included the Rif War (1925–6), the Syrian revolt (1925–30), the Kongo-Wara rebellion in French Equatorial Africa (1928–31), and the Yen Bay mutiny in Indochina 
 (1930–31).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> It is clear that 
 the encounter of colonial workers and <i>troupes</i> with Europe’s competing political, social, and economic ideologies (socialism, syndicalism, and communism among them) began to have an 
 effect in many French colonies. Wilson’s call for self-determination famously inspired Ho Chi Minh to enquire about the concept’s applicability to colonial possessions outside Europe. In 
 Africa, meanwhile, prominent political figures like Blaise Diagne exploited the rhetoric and ideals of French universalism and egalitarianism to carve out an enhanced role for non-white people
 within the French Empire, while French possessions in North Africa grew increasingly restive in the course of the 1920s<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">.</a>
 
 <br><br><b>(p.13)</b> Certainly, the vast majority of African veterans did not rise against their colonial masters.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> But, 
 if <i>troupes indigènes</i> did not provide a constituency for the 
 organization of anti-colonial violence, it was not because these men were satisfied in the happy enjoyment of increasing rights and acceptance under a progressive and humanitarian French 
 republican colonialism. First of all, there were practical obstacles to paramilitary mobilization. Once demobilized and thrust back into colonial societies, these men resumed their places in 
 a social and political hierarchy that was profoundly more racist and rigid than that of the metropole or the army, and where the mechanisms of social and political control were more or less 
 well developed and deployed by vigilant and suspicious colonial governments assiduous in the use of racial and legal controls to 
 uphold white “prestige<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">.</a>”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> Where rebellions did occur, they 
 invariably met a ruthless response. The French army and colonial authorities deployed overwhelming force against the four major rebellions of the interwar period, making use, like the British,
 of the latest military technology, such as air power, gas, and tanks, as well as superior numbers, firepower, communications, and logistics<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">.</a>
 
 <br><br>The British and French were not the only empires struggling to consolidate territorial gains and revive the legitimacy of imperial rule in the immediate post-war years. Japan’s leaders
 fought successfully in Paris to retain their wartime gains of territory and other concessions in China, obtaining the recognition of the other Allied powers of their takeover of former German 
 territories in Shandong Province. At the same time they brutally suppressed the widespread resistance associated with the March First Movement in their colony of Korea, a movement that erupted
 in the spring of 1919, inspired in part by Wilsonian rhetoric of self-determination. Despite Korean hopes for US support, however, Washington adopted a studied posture of neutrality on the 
 question of Korea, whose status as a colony it considered a settled matter<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>

 <br><br>The United States itself, of course, possessed several colonies in this period, territorial legacies of its victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898. Though Washington had already 
 moved further than other colonial powers in allowing native self-government in in the Philippines and Puerto Rico, during the war years US forces occupied both Haiti and the Dominican Republic
 and also conducted several incursions into Mexican territory, even as Washington consolidated quasi-protectorates in Cuba, Nicaragua, and elsewhere in the 
 Caribbean<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">.</a> As Christopher Capozzola 
 shows in his chapter, though the United States did not recruit many colonial troops to fight in Europe, it did develop during those years an approach to policing its growing domains that would
 shape it relationships with colonies and quasi-colonies for decades to come. At the same time, Woodrow Wilson and <b>(p.14)</b> his successors began to imagine a far more ambitious 
 American imperium, 
 a global imperium of nation states interlocked in a system of international organizations and governed by the principles of free trade. In this new order the United States would serve as first
 among equals, and within it US economic (and later, military) preponderance would sustain Washington’s hegemony globally. Hence the US pursuit of a new order in East Asia, a goal at least 
 temporarily achieved with the Washington Conference of 1922, which sought to stabilize the post-war order in the “Far East” in much the same way that Lausanne would do in the “Near East” the 
 following year<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">.</a>
 
 <br><br>As Leonard Smith demonstrates in the final chapter of this book, empires constituted both problems and solutions at the Paris Peace Conference. The disintegration of the Habsburg 
 Monarchy, Imperial Russia, and the Ottoman Empire created a vacuum of sovereignty in Central and Eastern Europe, and in the Middle East. The Wilsonian discursive framework accepted by the 
 Great Powers at the time of the Armistice with Germany in November 1918 legitimized self-determined nation states as the successors to empire. As peacemaking continued beyond what had been the
 Western Front, the imperial Great Powers proved less and less able to control the peace being made. Imperial expansion through League of Nations mandates laid the foundations for restive 
 successor states. By the time of the settlement in Anatolia in 1923, successor states sharply demarcated the limits of imperial authority.
 
 <br><br>Even the relationship between the white dominions and the British Empire had fundamentally changed. The dominions claimed a place at the conference in their own right and fought for 
 their own interests.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> Nonetheless the form of post-war nationalism in the settler dominions varied. For Canada and South Africa the 
 pressing problem of appeasing large, disgruntled non-British ethnic communities, further embittered by the war, drove the mobilization of nationalist sentiment, as the ideological glue to 
 keep these fragile polities together in the immediate post-war years. In both these dominions nationalism was articulated around a move away from the empire—more republican, self-sufficient, 
 and grounded in a sense of cultural difference from the British.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> In Australia 
 and New Zealand post-war nationalism was equally strong, but in contrast oriented around the twin themes of national maturity and empire loyalty. Far from nationalism 
 being the antithesis of empire, as in other settler dominions, in Australia and New Zealand nation and empire were inextricably linked<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">.</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a>

 <br><br>The geographical coverage of this volume reflects our ambition to restore the Great War’s character as a <i>world</i> war, to give due attention to combatant empires <b>(p.15)</b> that
 usually receive little attention in general histories of the Great War, such as Portugal. As Filipe Ribeiro de Meneses argues, the young Portuguese republic held on tenuously to considerable 
 imperial domains, which it was financially and economically unable to exploit. Even before the country entered the war, in March 1916, considerable fighting had already occurred in its 
 principal African possessions, Angola and Mozambique, both with a number of local ethnicities and with the European-led garrisons of neighbouring German colonies. Once Portugal had become a 
 belligerent, however, the situation worsened considerably: over two-thirds of Portugal’s fatal war-related casualties were incurred in Africa, and the death toll among the indigenous 
 population was incalculably higher. Serious questions were asked at the Paris Peace Conference about Portugal’s suitability as a colonizer under the new Wilsonian dispensation. Nevertheless, 
 the African campaigns were seen and commemorated in the metropole as part of the struggle against Germany and therefore as an essential component of Portugal’s right to empire.
 
 <br><br>Italy is another important if often overlooked practitioner of imperial warfare in this period, as Richard Bosworth and Giuseppe Finaldi show in their chapter. Widely seen as the least
 of the Great Powers and yet compelled to measure itself against the imperial ghosts of ancient Rome, the “Third Italy” joined the race for empire when and where it could. Though the result was
 an empire of “rags and patches,” the Italian invasion of Ottoman Libya in 1911 augured the road to war, and the Italian Empire was also represented in the war in Europe. African troops, 
 enrolled in Eritrea and Italian Somalia, were part of the national military. From 1915 to 1918 the Italian military tried, often ineffectually and frequently brutally, to shore up their shaky 
 rule in Libya, while all sensible tacticians demanded that the country focus its power in Europe. Once the European war had been won, Italy returned to its “pacification” of the “fourth 
 shore,” killing perhaps 100,000 indigenes under the Fascist dictatorship that took control in Rome in October 1922.

 <br><br>The Great War was a war of empires, fought primarily by empires and for the survival or expansion of empire. Ironically, perhaps, it delivered a debilitating blow to dynastic 
 empires—for centuries the pre-eminent type of state organization—and to imperial expansion and acquisition as the main logic of relations between states in world affairs. None of the three 
 dynastic empires on the side of the Central Powers survived the war in its pre-war form, and all of them (and their constituent parts, at least within Europe) were reorganized after the war 
 into one republican form or another, even while sometimes preserving the territorial forms and usually some form of the oppressive practices of their imperial predecessors in new guises. The 
 empires on the Allied side—with the notable and significant exception of Russia—managed to survive and even expanded their imperial territories. A war fought for the “rights of small nations”,
 however, could not but undermine severely the legitimacy of imperial formations and strain the relations of imperial centers with even the most enthusiastic of imperial peripheries—namely the 
 British Crown’s “white dominions<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">.</a>” It was not simply that equality in sacrifice implied equality in status and rights—after all, “peripheral” populations had been fighting for empires for 
 millennia without expecting, or receiving, such a reward. It was that the logic of popular rule, which argued that political legitimacy derived not <b>(p.16)</b> from divine sanction but from 
 the people, had finally, after a long and arduous process, achieved near universal recognition. The argument from civilization, the imperial scoundrel’s last redoubt, drowned in the ocean of 
 blood that flowed in the battlefields, even—especially—in the empires’ most “civilized” European provinces<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">.</a>
 
 <br><br>The post-war violence that wracked the territories of most of the participants, both winners and losers, was in part a struggle over the remnants of fallen empires. But it also 
 reflected the crisis of imperial legitimacy ignited by the war and its aftermath. The spectacular appearance of President Wilson on the international stage, with his talk of self-determination
 and the rights of small nations, and the yet uncertain but growing specter of revolution in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern and Central Europe together made for a volatile mix of ideas, 
 examples, and potential sources of support for the enemies of empire everywhere. The global movement of information and ideas, its pace quickened by the war and recent technological and 
 institutional development, meant that the anti-imperial contagion spread quickly<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">.</a> By 1923, even as the United States retreated off the global stage for the moment, networks of communist 
 organizers, emboldened by the support of the now consolidated regime in Moscow, set about establishing the organizational structure for revolution against empire across the colonial world. 
 Meanwhile, the former European territories of the Habsburgs, in an often bloody and generally chaotic process whose general direction was nevertheless quite clear, were established as nation 
 states. Across the world, the imperial state as a form of territorial governance was under attack and in retreat, while the nation state was on the rise. And, while it took another several 
 decades and an even more destructive war between 1937 and 1945 to usher the process of imperial dissolution toward completion, the Greater War of 1911–23 was a crucial watershed in that 
 process<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">.</a>
