 <h2>Chad Denton, <i>Yonsei University, South Korea</i> </h2> 
 
 <blockquote>This article traces the implementation, execution, and results of the French Ministry of Armaments’
 scrap iron collection drive from September 1939 to June 1940. This collection drive was a belated effort to 
 mobilize patriotic sentiment and raw materials for France’s war effort. By the late 1930s, the French government
realized that it did not have — and, more importantly, would not be able to acquire — enough metal to meet 
ambitious armament plans. In September 1939, Raoul Dautry, the Minister of Armaments, began moving toward a 
controlled economy by setting up central distribution organizations, preventing the movement of stocks, and
organizing the national scrap drive, modelled, in part, on Germany. Despite a rural distrust of the state and 
cases of individuals hoarding metal, most people responded to the call. Yet logistical difficulties in finances,
manpower, and transportation hampered efforts. By May 1940, half of the 85,000 tons collected remained piled on
the platforms of railway stations. With the invasion, the Germans immediately confiscated this metal. With the
defeat of France, this failed drive came to symbolize France’s defeat and humiliation, as well as the impotence
of the Third Republic.</blockquote>

 <h2>‘With your scrap iron we will forge victorious steel!’ </h2> 
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Jacques Mallouet’s memoirs about his childhood in the Auvergnat village of Valette, France, describe 
 an almost entirely forgotten episode of the ‘phoney war’ of 1939-1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> 
 Mallouet remembered that, when he was a twelve-year-old boy in the early spring of 1940, 
 his teacher Madame Viala had put up two propaganda posters on the classroom walls.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> 
 The first was a world map with the slogan, ‘we will win because we 
 are the strongest’ (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Figure 1</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> The map showed France and 
 Great Britain and their colonial possessions coloured in red, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, most of 
 Africa and the Near East, and almost all of South and South-east Asia. The message was simple: tiny Germany, 
 a black spot in the middle of the map, surely stood no chance against the combined might of two empires. 
 The poster projected strength, but the classroom’s other poster curiously contradicted that 
 strength<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-300">.</a></p> 
 
 <p>The second poster looked like the French flag turned on its side: dark blue and red horizontal bands, 
 with light grey in between. But careful inspection revealed the background to be a black-and-white 
 photograph of a jumble of old radiators, chairs, coat racks, and lattice-work fences. A row of thin, 
 razor-sharp bayonets lined the bottom, and on top, in big block letters, was the phrase, ‘With your scrap
 iron we will forge victorious steel!’ (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-202">Figure 2</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> But 
 if France was so strong, Mallouet thought, why was scrap metal needed to make munitions? </p> 
 
 <p>Young Mallouet was uneasy. He knew that Germany was more dangerous than the propaganda posters suggested.
 His previous teacher, Monsieur Chaussade, had been briefly mobilized during the Munich crisis in September 
 1938 and had often mentioned Germany’s aggressive rearmament during the daily moral lesson and civil defence
 drills.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> He had even used a political map to demonstrate how 
 Germany had invaded Austria and then the 
 Sudetenland. Mallouet remembered how Monsieur Chaussade had placed his left hand on the border of Germany 
 and Czechoslovakia so that his thumb and forefingers made a capital C, and said, ‘the two claws of the 
 pincer are going to close soon!’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> And they did. 
 Germany invaded the rest of the country a few months later. 
 Now, in the spring of 1940, ‘tiny Germany’—with Austria, Czechoslovakia and half of Poland filled in 
 black—looked to be almost twice the size of France; Monsieur Chaussade, mobilized somewhere in France, 
 waited for the next German attack, while his replacement, Madame Viala, encouraged her students to go into 
 their small village and collect scrap metal for the war effort.</p> 
 
 <p>Despite his apprehensions, Mallouet heeded the call. As the son of a former metal worker, he was 
 particularly suited for the task.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> On Sunday and Thursday mornings, he and his school mates scoured the 
 rubbish dump near the Sumène river for iron scrap and tin cans. In a courtyard behind the school, the 
 children heaped enough metal to fill two trucks for transport to the train station, where it was separated, 
 weighed, and readied for loading.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a></p> 
 
 <p>Mallouet’s experience was not atypical. School children, as well 
 as mayors, priests, teachers, veterans, and retirees, carried out similar collections in cities and towns 
 throughout France in the winter and spring of 1940. They collected over 85,000 tonnes of scrap metal—over 
 two kilogrammes per person or one large cast iron saucepan for every French man, woman, and child.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a></p> 
 
 <h2>‘Self-deception and simulacra of strength’</h2>

 <p>Detailed accounts of the Armaments Ministry’s scrap iron collection drive are rare and when mentioned 
 usually emphasize the weakness of French propaganda.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> 
 Memoirs and diaries from the period contain occasional,
 fleeting references: either descriptions of metal piled on train platforms or propaganda posters on city 
 walls.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> In hindsight, slogans like ‘let’s forge the steel 
 of victory’ and ‘we are the strongest’ show how—in
 the words of one memoirist—French ‘optimism was unwarranted’ and ‘rested on self-deception and simulacra of 
 strength’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>In his cultural history of France in the 1930s, <i>The Hollow Years</i>, Eugen Weber is equally
 dismissive: ‘war propaganda does not consist of treating adults like children, feeding them slogans and 
 patriotic pap. There was nothing wrong with collecting scrap iron [...] But a people at war must be prepared
 for danger, for effort, for exertions of will’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> 
 Implicit in Weber’s criticism is that the cowardly, 
 indolent, and apathetic French were ill-prepared for ‘the war nobody wanted’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> During the ‘phony war’, 
 Weber suggests, the ‘decadence’ of the 1930s culminated in ‘an internal peace that was just as phony’: 
 ‘There was less fighting between French and Germans than between French and French, prewar disputes 
 continuing unappeased between Left and right, but also within each side, each with its bellicists, its 
 pacifists, its defeatists’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Weber was not the first to explain France’s 1940 defeat by referring 
 to the discord and disunity of the 1930s. Since its posthumous publication in 1946, Marc Bloch’s <i>Strange 
 Defeat</i> has been the starting point for a long line of scholarship that targets the failings of France’s 
 political and military leaders as well as the interwar French society that shaped the ‘psychological 
 conditions in which [those leaders] lived’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> 
 Those who have challenged this picture have argued not that 
 French society of the 1930s was particularly cohesive or stable, but rather that battlefield contingencies
 and great-power politics better explained France’s collapse.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> 
 Recent research, however, has begun to offer 
 a more nuanced view of French society from the Munich Crisis in 1938 to France’s defeat in 1940. Historians
 such as Daniel Hucker and William D. Irvine—confirming the views of Jean-Louis Crémieux-Brilhac’s extensive
 study of the year 1940—argue that soon after the declaration of war in September 1939 the French people 
 resolutely rallied to the flag despite their fears of the coming war.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> In his careful study of French 
 strategy, domestic politics, and economic mobilization from September 1939 to May 1940, Talbot Imlay, 
 however, emphasizes the continued hesitations and disunity of French leaders. Imlay argues that ‘France 
 lacked the economic structure needed for a long war’, in part, because of a reliance on ‘laissez-faire 
 economic policies’ and a distrust of economic planning.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a></p> 
 
 <p>Mallouet’s memory of the scrap iron collection drive offers a way to bring together these new 
 interpretations of French society, politics, and economic life during the ‘phony war’. Mallouet’s worries 
 about the propaganda posters coupled with his enthusiastic participation in the drive reveal tensions 
 between the French government’s efforts to boost morale and its economic preparations for war. As Mallouet 
 suspected, the collection drive was indeed a belated effort to mobilize patriotic sentiment and raw 
 materials for the war effort, but, more than that, it became a conduit for French hopes and anxieties, 
 briefly allowing those on the home front to feel like they were contributing collectively to the war 
 effort. </p> 
 
 <p>Examination of surviving records (documents from the French Armaments Ministry; national and regional 
 newspapers; correspondence among mayors, prefects,and chambers of commerce) shows not only the origins, 
 implementation, and results of this collection drive but also the latent potential of the French population 
 at war. In spite of contradictions in propaganda messaging, bureaucratic infighting, and logistical 
 logjams, the limited success of this collection drive reveals a much stronger unity in the countryside than 
 historians—and political leaders at that time—suspected. The concerted local efforts of school teachers, 
 mayors, and chambers of commerce—encouraged by the dynamic Armaments Minister Raoul Dautry—often 
 circumvented the sclerotic central administration. Nevertheless, following France’s sudden defeat in the 
 summer of 1940, this unity was quickly forgotten. </p>
 
 <h2>‘We will win because we are the strongest.’ </h2>
 
 <p>Wars are won, in part, by the side that most effectively mobilizes the economic and spiritual resources 
 of its population. In <i>Why the Allies Won</i>, historian Richard Overy argued, ‘The Allies won [...] because they
 turned their economic strength into effective fighting power, and turned the moral energies of their people
 into an effective will to win’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> In the summer of 1939, 
 despite doubts about the French and British moral 
 commitment to war, many believed that France and Britain had the greater economic strength in a future 
 contest with Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Citing the success of the Allied 
 blockade in the First World War, experts argued 
 that Germany’s inadequate supply of manpower, food, oil, and metals was no match for France and Britain’s 
 inexhaustible colonial resources. In books like <i>Why Hitler Can’t Win</i>, émigré engineers bolstered this 
 argument with evidence from German sources, including statistics, diagrams, and graphs showing annual 
 production levels, the imbalance between imports and exports, and Germany’s dwindling foreign currency 
 reserves.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>From September through December, the daily press and popular illustrated weeklies, such as <i>Match</i> and 
 <i>L’Illustration</i>, echoed these arguments. They cited the German government’s ‘draconian’ rationing of food 
 and goods as proof of the Allied blockade’s effectiveness.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> 
 A spread in <i>Match</i> showed photographs (and 
 statistics) of a typical German family’s limited rations of meat, cheese, jam, butter, milk, oil, coffee, 
 soap, coal, and even textiles.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> One cartoon implied that 
 food shortages would cause Hitler to force all 
 Germans to become, like him, ‘veget-aryans’ (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-203">Figure 3</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Reviews and excerpts of the émigré technical literature also stressed Germany’s critical metal 
 shortages, especially for iron ore. They described how Germany imported twice as much as it produced, how 
 domestically produced German ore was substandard, and how a lack of manpower and industrial capacity (blast 
 furnaces and foundries) limited processing potential.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> 
 To illustrate Germany’s desperate need for metal, 
 they frequently described German scrap metal salvage efforts and use of substitute products.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> A cartoon in
 <i>Candide</i> illustrated Germany’s ‘armaments crisis’ by combining Goering’s penchant for military decoration 
 with the German scrap metal drives. Goering, gesturing at his ample torso and bedroom covered in military 
 medals, asks Hitler, ‘An armaments crisis? Are you kidding? With all this to melt into cannons?’ 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-204">Figure 4</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>
 </p> 
 
 <p>The counterpart to the French argument for German relative economic weakness was the idea that France 
 and Britain had access to unlimited colonial resources. Maps published in Parisian illustrated magazines 
 documented British and French material superiority by showing the territorial extent of empire and the 
 materials available there (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-205">Figure 5</a>). For metals, 
 these included Indochinese tin, New Caledonian nickel, 
 Central African copper, and Algerian iron and lead.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Finance Minister Paul Reynaud argued in a national radio address in early September that, rather than 
 the military front, it was the ‘economic, financial and monetary front’ that would ensure French victory.
 Germany, according to Reynaud, was already ‘worn down by the gigantic effort that it had undertaken to 
 prepare for war’ and ‘economically and financially [...] [was] very vulnerable’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> France, on the other 
 hand, had increased military production and had gold reserves to buy raw materials. To maximise this 
 advantage, France would have to ‘consume as little as possible’ and ‘produce as much as possible’. 
 Reynaud closed his speech by evoking Germany’s defeat in the First World War: ‘On 11 November 1918, 
 Germany succumbed to the superior Allied war potential. This superiority remains [...] the weight of the 
 two most powerful Empires in the world, that of England and ours, has been thrown into the balance. We 
 will win because we are the strongest’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Reynaud’s last phrase quickly became the slogan for France’s economic war effort. Several newspapers 
 used it as their headlines in reprints of his speech, and by late November, the Finance Ministry had 
 developed the poster that Jacques Mallouet would see in his classroom 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-206">Figure 6</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>But Reynaud himself did not believe that France was the strongest. On 4 December 1939, Reynaud signed 
 an accord with his British counterpart Sir John Simon, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that resolved how 
 the British and French would divide the costs for joint military spending. At a press conference in Paris 
 a week later, Reynaud boldly declared, ‘This accord is vast in both time and space [...] Vast in time, 
 because it extends throughout the duration of the war [...] vast in space, because it extends throughout 
 the entire British and French empires’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> 
 While the French press reprinted excerpts of his press conference 
 speech, the American press published excerpts of an earlier speech to the Chamber of Deputies that revealed
 Reynaud’s profound doubts about France’s readiness. An article in the <i>New York Times</i> reported that Reynaud
 described to the assembled deputies the resources of ‘the two great empires’ but then cautioned, <blockquote>With 
 all this at their disposal the democracies will conquer, but perhaps at the price of sacrifices of which they
 have not yet dreamed. This war which began amidst general apathy may possibly end in a general 
 conflagration. [...] If we do not enter the fight prepared for anything it will be easy, much too easy, to 
 lose the war.</blockquote> Reynaud then evoked, as paraphrased by the <i>Times</i> reporter, Germany’s greater 
 willingness to make sacrifices: <blockquote>M. Reynaud is a maker of catch phrases, and this speech [...] was 
 replete with them. It must be 
 remembered, he declared, that France, though recently recovering, was really only ‘convalescent’ when 
 war broke out. He reminded the Deputies that he always said that three years would be necessary for 
 complete recovery. Germany, though ruined, had practiced spartan privations, he went on, and her 
 population was trained to sacrifices that had permitted her astonishing rearmament and her success in 
 establishing terror in Europe.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a></blockquote> 
 
 Whereas the French press understood German sacrifices as evidence for economic weakness, Reynaud saw 
 the same sacrifices as evidence for Germany’s spiritual strength, namely, a far greater willpower and 
 commitment to war than that of the ‘convalescent’ French. In his eyes, Germany was the strongest.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a></blockquote> </p>

 <h2>‘An armaments crisis?’ </h2>
 
 <p>By mid-December 1939, Reynaud had realised that France’s economic mobilization had failed. For Reynaud, 
 the more serious armaments crisis was not in Germany, but in France, where deficiencies in organization 
 and continued inadequate supplies of raw materials threatened arms production.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> Shortly before Reynaud’s 
 appointment as Finance Minister in November 1938 the French government realized that it did not have—and 
 more importantly, would not be able to acquire—enough metal to meet ambitious armaments plans. </p> 
 
 <p>Despite the frequently evoked importance and availability of Indochinese tin and North African lead 
 and zinc, production numbers obscured fundamental weaknesses. A refusal to enforce price controls—
 understood as ‘contrary to the general policy of the government, given their semi-autarkic character’—
 threatened the viability of existing lead and zinc mines in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> And none of 
 the colonies had significant refining capacity, meaning that the raw or partially refined ore, such as New Caledonian nickel matte, 
 had to be refined in France (at its refinery in Le Havre) or in Norway, where abundant hydro-power 
 allowed for the inexpensive processing of metal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>French difficulties with raw material acquisition became apparent following the Munich crisis in 
 September 1938, when the War Ministry revised its war plan and doubled the need for infantry munitions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> 
 Officials quickly realized that France did not have enough copper and zinc to meet the new targets, and, 
 more ominously, was unlikely to find enough on the world market, partly because of German stockpiling.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> 
 To overcome these deficiencies, the War Ministry decided to substitute steel for brass (an alloy of 
 copper and zinc) in the manufacture of bullets and shell casings—a process that the Germans had pioneered 
 and supposedly perfected during the First World War. In late December, the Armaments Production Division 
 expanded earlier studies of steel substitution, and asked the Cartoucherie de Valence to begin converting 
 their factory to produce steel cartridges, with an initial order of five million.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> The first progress 
 report on Valence in early February 1939 revealed the limitations of this solution. It would take nine 
 months to complete the order, four German-made machines still needed to be purchased, and Swedish steel 
 had to be imported, because of the lower quality of French steel. The report concluded, optimistically 
 and without a trace of irony, that ‘in just a few months the question of steel shells will be at the same 
 point of advancement as in Germany’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>This one example among many illustrates the consequences of France’s laissez-faire approach to 
 armaments production. The legacy of the Popular Front and tensions between organized labour and industry 
 had convinced French leaders to leave economic management up to market forces and industry.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> Plans 
 developed in the early 1930s detailed economic controls in case of mobilization, including procedures for
 surveying stocks and for purchasing and distributing raw materials. These plans, however, remained on 
 the shelf.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Instead, a corps of superintendents, organized loosely by ‘economic region’, acted as liaisons between 
 the contradictory imperatives of government and private industry. After the declaration of war in 1939, 
 as an article in <i>L’Illustration</i> explained, they were supposed to coordinate regional action, which would 
 ‘allow a more supple application of measures and avoid the constraining effect of a directed economy’. 
 The Commerce Minister appointed the General Secretary for these ‘economic regions’, but they still 
 remained largely independent—the article stressed how this organization was unlike the ‘rigid unity 
 enforced by totalitarian states’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The results were disastrous. French factory owners avoided converting to munitions production because 
 of their unprofitability in the peacetime economy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> 
 In the summer of 1939, without any central organization
 for the allocation of raw materials, as Talbot Imlay has described, ‘a free-for-all ensued as various 
 departments, industries and firms competed for scarce resources, preventing their optimal use while 
 driving up prices and demand’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, French economic organization was unprepared to meet 
 the German threat. Regional surveys of the metallurgical industry for armaments production, written 
 between September and December 1939, revealed disorganization and inefficiencies in orders, machinery, 
 manpower, transportation, financing, and especially raw materials.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The reports described widespread shortages of copper, tin, and brass and all nine reports cited a 
 ‘deficit in scrap iron’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> In mid-October in the 
 Ardennes region, one factory had only a three-week supply while another had only enough for one week.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> This was no small matter. Scrap iron (<i>ferraille</i>) 
 was a necessary component of the steel-making process. Using a bed of scrap in the blast furnace greatly 
 reduced the energy needed to forge the steel, increasing hourly production.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> One forge that ran out of scrap had to shut down 
 production for twenty-six days.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>A variety of factors account for these shortages. Finding sufficient quantities of metal on 
 international markets became increasingly difficult. A foundry in Nantes was unable to buy copper from 
 its regular supplier in Britain when British export controls blocked shipment.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> Domestically, the French 
 national railway company SNCF refused to give up its iron trimmings from rails or their used cupric 
 metals, and private companies held on to their scarce scrap.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> 
 That left the network of metal brokers 
 (<i>marchands de métaux</i>), blacksmiths, and scrap dealers, but many of them had been mobilized. Those who 
 remained hoarded their stock to benefit from rising prices or were unable to sell because of inadequate 
 transportation and manpower.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a></p> 
 
 <p>The man called in to clean up this national mess was Raoul Dautry. He was the ideal candidate. In the 
 summer of 1918, Dautry had supervised 11,400 workers working night and day, seven days a week, for one 
 hundred days, to complete a miracle: a 90 km railway and tunnel that allowed French forces 
 to counter Ludendorff’s military offencive.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a>
 Dautry routinely worked eighteen-hour days, sleeping only 
 four hours a night. This feat was not lost on one admiring British reporter who described how, after three 
 sleepless nights, Dautry’s ‘mind was as nimble, as though he had slept soundly through all three of them’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a>
 Known by his subordinates as ‘the little Volcano’, Dautry cared little for the manners of politics and 
 bureaucracy, admiring instead the leadership style of the Portuguese dictator Salazar, which favoured 
 swift, practical decisions implemented by a hierarchically organized meritocratic elite.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a> Another of 
 Dautry’s ‘heroes’ was the late German Jewish industrialist Walther Rathenau.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a>
 In the summer of 1914, 
 Rathenau nearly single-handedly saved the German war effort when he set-up and headed the War Raw 
 Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung, or KRA) which put in place a series of strict economic 
 controls.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> High hopes accompanied Dautry’s 13 September 
 1939 appointment to the newly created position of Armaments Minister.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> </p> 
 
 <p> Dautry immediately began the Sisyphean task of restructuring France’s economy for war. He quickly 
 determined that all the previous planning had produced only ‘paper’ and that ‘all the work done 
 before [...] had to be taken up anew’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> On 19 
 September when French President Daladier asked about the 
 status of armaments production, Dautry replied, ‘if we take all the necessary measures, in one year, 
 production will <i>begin</i>’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> Three days later, Dautry met with all the directors of state arsenals, 
 workshops, forges, and foundries (over 100 people) and questioned them from eight o’clock in the morning 
 until midnight, imploring them not to ‘hide behind paper’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a>
 Their reports could not have been encouraging. During the same meeting, he fired several high-ranking 
 officers and a general.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>From October to December 1939, Dautry formed a series of central distribution organizations, and to 
 regulate the chaotic domestic metals market he established price controls and procedures for surveying
 the quantities of industrial reserves. At the national level, the Groupement d’Importation et d’Achat 
 des Ferrailles or GIAF controlled the import, purchase, and distribution of scrap iron.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>At the departmental level, Dautry combined <i>dirigisme</i> with a laissez-faire approach. Addressing 
 complaints from small business owners without arms contracts, he asked prefects to use presidents of 
 the economic regions, chambers of commerce, professional and producer organizations to form ‘groups’ or 
 ‘families’ of producers. He cited examples where this had been successful: small factory owners had 
 joined together in Lyon, industrialists in the Nord had created groups with fifteen to sixty members, and 
 moulders and shapers had joined forces in the Savoie metal industry. Dautry argued that these organizations, 
 much better than his ministry, would be better able to allocate materials and orders for munitions 
 contracts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a>
 </p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, Dautry helped establish foreign missions to purchase raw materials from abroad.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> 
 Missions to the United States, Britain, and Belgium were particularly successful and assured most of 
 France’s needs in non-ferrous metals, including copper, tin, lead, nickel, and brass.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Despite these apparent successes, in private Dautry admitted that France’s industrial mobilization 
 was failing. In late November, to the Chamber of Deputies’ Army Commission, Dautry described insufficient 
 supplies of raw materials as well as the miserable state of industrial organization, and declared, 
 ‘The problem for us is much worse than in 1914 [...]. I am not a miracle worker so don’t count on a 
 miracle on my part to get you out of this’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a>
 As France’s position failed to improve, Dautry became 
 increasingly concerned about Germany’s access to raw materials from neutral countries. </p> 
 
 <p>In late November, foreign missions to Scandinavia revealed a gaping hole in the Allied blockade. The 
 French delegate discovered that Finland’s total copper ore production was being sent to Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> The 
 situation in Norway was even worse. Norwegian production of zinc, aluminium, and nickel was essential 
 in war fabrications. Though much of the ore came from Allied countries, Norway primarily exported the 
 finished metals to Germany or neutral countries because of pre-existing contracts. British demands for 
 Norway to stop exporting metal to Germany risked losing Norwegian neutrality, but if the Allies stopped 
 sending raw materials to Norway, metallurgical production would shut down and Allied supplies from there
 would end.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Yet the most serious problem, also related to Norwegian neutrality, was the export of high quality 
 iron ore from northern Sweden to Germany by way of the so-called ‘iron road’, the rail and sea routes 
 that brought Swedish ore either through the Gulf of Bothnia — frozen during the winter — or to the 
 Norwegian port of Narvik (ice-free year round) where it was shipped through Rotterdam or Emden to 
 refineries in northern Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> 
 On 6 December 1939, Dautry wrote to President Daladier at once, advising 
 military action to cut off Germany’s Swedish iron supply.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> 
 The Supreme Allied Council debated the issue ten days later, but tabled it until February 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Despite his pessimism, in late December, Dautry reported to Daladier that his ministry had inventoried 
 resources, assured provisioning France with raw materials, and increased the number of factories devoted 
 to armaments production. Still fearing German material superiority, however, Dautry proposed the creation 
 of an armaments advisory council, with representatives from the public and private sector, to have ‘a more 
 rational utilisation of material resources, machines, and men’ by, in part, ‘suppressing wasted time, energy, 
 material and products,’ and ‘salvaging waste material’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> 
 With the proposal approved, Dautry decided to begin salvage operations consciously modelled on the Germans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> </p>
 
 <h2>Imitating the Germans, ‘à la française’ </h2>
 
 <p>In late January 1940, the British cartoonist David Low published a cartoon that captured the combination 
 of fear, admiration, and self-consciousness that Allied leaders felt toward Nazi Germany. In her book on the 
 British home front, historian Sonya Rose uses the cartoon as an example of how British ‘hegemonic masculinity’ 
 was shaped in opposition to the ‘hyper-masculinity’ of Nazi Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> As Rose describes, the cartoon shows 
 three figures in a gym. In the foreground stands a large, shirtless, balding man wearing the Union Jack as 
 a pair of shorts and holding two small barbells. Identified as ‘Allies’ Potential Superiority’, he looks over 
 his shoulder at his two smaller ‘coaches’, the tall, elderly Sir John ‘Simon’, and a much more vigorous, but 
 diminutive, ‘Reynaud’, both carrying barbells themselves. Simon points to an enormous portrait on the back 
 wall of a muscular figure meant to represent Germany and remarks, ‘All you need is hard training’ 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-207">Figure 7</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a>
 </p> 
 
 <p>The cartoon, as Rose argues, ‘connected the physically fit male body with the military might and leadership
 necessary to win the war’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
 But with its depiction of Reynaud and Simon, the cartoon also directly connected 
 ‘Allied potential’ with economic mobilization—in particular Reynaud’s slogan ‘we are the strongest’—and, 
 indirectly, with the idea that economic mobilization needed to follow the ‘hard training’ already successfully 
 undertaken by Germany. The cartoon also suggests that Reynaud, who was less than 150 cm tall, was a 
 particularly poor emissary for such shows of strength. </p> 
 
 <p>The French decision to imitate the Germans by instituting a salvage drive in the winter of 1940 would 
 prove to be more difficult than anticipated. Just as the British struggled to distinguish their own ‘temperate
 heroes’ from the ‘hyper-masculinity’ and aggressive militarism of the Germans, as Rose argues, so too, did 
 the French struggle to hold on to their ideal of their society’s greater freedom even as they adopted what 
 they had previously derided as Germany’s ‘draconian’ methods of economic mobilization. </p> 
 
 <p>In early December 1939, the French High Commissioner for National Economy, Daniel Serruys, first introduced
 the idea of a national salvage drive in a speech that was widely reprinted in newspapers. After describing 
 how the Germans had ‘for a long time [...] Used old tin cans [and] the zinc from used batteries,’ Serruys 
 explained how the French government would begin a national salvage drive. But, unlike in Germany, it would 
 be voluntary: ‘The French government, the Government of a free people, understands that this salvage must 
 remain voluntary. Let’s salvage… <i>à la française</i>, without constraints, without coercive measures’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Rather than passing laws requiring participation, Dautry delegated the task to the presidents of the 
 chambers of commerce and the SNCF (the French national railway company), providing them with a set of 
 general, voluntary instructions. During January and February, metal would be collected and weighed either 
 at local train stations or a centre run by the local mayor. The SNCF or the city government would pay 
 fifteen francs per kilogramme, then be reimbursed by the GIAF. The proceeds from donated metal would benefit 
 the Secours National, organized by a decree on 19 October 1939 to care for refugees and the families of 
 mobilized soldiers. Dautry asked individual authorities to use personal influence and even sent New Year 
 cards to mayors reminding them of the salvage drive’s importance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The collection drive would be supported with a vigorous propaganda campaign, including ‘articles in the
 press, radio announcements, posters [and] films’ that reinforced the themes of protecting loved ones, 
 self-defence, and volunteerism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a>
 For this campaign, the Armaments Ministry developed a five-point plan 
 listing the ‘general arguments’ of the propaganda. Like Serruys’ speech, the propaganda would emphasize 
 the voluntary nature of the French salvage drive, in opposition to German efforts, but, more importantly, 
 would directly exploit the fears of those on the home front. It began with France’s precarious demographic 
 situation and French leaders’ ‘urgent need to conserve the race for the future peace’. To minimize loss of 
 life, soldiers needed to be protected with ‘carapaces of steel’ and ‘overcome the adversary’s defences by 
 inundating them with a rain of steel’. Victory was simply a matter of having the most steel. But steel 
 came from iron, and iron was in short supply. Whereas Germany had, for a number of years, ‘inflicted on 
 its population unparallelled sacrifices to acquire iron’, France had been exporting 500,000 tonnes a year. 
 With war, exports had stopped, but French monthly consumption had increased from 60,000 to 250,000 tonnes. 
 Only by salvaging scrap iron from every household would France avoid importing iron (sparing valuable gold 
 reserves), and provide enough raw material for the munitions needed for France’s soldiers. Every home had 
 ‘a real arsenal’ of material in cellars, sheds, or attics that could be transformed into shells, machine 
 guns, and bullets.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The plan then offered arguments for those who had ‘a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a friend at 
 the front’: ‘You have given him the Maginot Line [...] you have sent him letters to bolster his morale, 
 care packages to improve his daily life, won’t you send him the munitions that are indispensable to attack?’.
 For those without family members, the plan evoked the fear of aerial bombardment, describing the importance 
 of scrap for anti-aircraft defences. Finally, the final line provided the financial incentive, with the 
 counter-example of German forced requisitions: ‘Not only is France simply asking you for this iron scrap,
 while Germany demands it of all Germans, France will even pay you for it’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The slogan on a poster created for a drive in Paris read, ‘Do you want to save the life of those on the 
 front lines? Do you want to do something for your own security? Yes? [...] then give us your scrap iron for 
 national defence’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a>
 But the primary vehicle for propaganda would not be newspapers, posters, radio, and 
 film. Rather, it would be schoolchildren like twelve-year-old Jacques Mallouet. Emphasis on this means of 
 publicizing was not an accident but carefully calculated. </p> 
 
 <p>In mid-January 1940, a widely distributed letter described children as ‘excellent propagandists’ who 
 needed to be associated ‘with this effort so necessary for victory’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a> Teachers, like Madame Viala, were 
 to be the linchpin of this campaign because only ‘children could ensure, in the most reliable and 
 persuasive way, that the propaganda would be easily disseminated into rural communes’. To facilitate 
 the focus on children, teachers received a detailed lesson plan from the Ministry of Education. First 
 teachers presented their students with ‘steel’s primordial role in modern warfare,’ by describing the 
 range of armaments that used steel, including tanks, machine-guns, airplanes, bombs, shells, torpedoes,
 and artillery shells. For older students, teachers next taught the ‘economic geography’ of France’s coal
 and iron resources. Finally, teachers explained and emphasized the importance of collecting scrap metal 
 like ‘old toys, kitchen utensils, pans, kitchen ranges, gas or coal stoves, old tools, broken pitchforks,
 worn-out ploughs, rusted shovels or old iron beds’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a>
 The plan had teachers conclude the salvage lesson 
 by encouraging their students to collect these objects and explain to their families that the drive would 
 protect soldiers and civilians, shorten the war, and provide considerable financial compensation for those 
 with large quantities of metal. </p> 
 
 <p>To help these young propaganda agents and metal collectors, Dautry’s Ministry produced a series of 
 inventive propaganda materials. In addition to the poster that Mallouet’s teacher prominently displayed, 
 these included good behaviour certificates (<i>billets de satisfaction</i>), postcards that children could use 
 to tell their mobilized fathers how much metal their children had collected, and even a coloured comic 
 strip (<i>image d’Épinal</i>) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-208">Figure 8</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Entitled ‘A Beautiful Christmas Fairytale’, it told the story of Titi, a little boy who wanted to help 
 win the war (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-209">Figure 9</a>). An old woman in the forest who turns 
 out to be a fairy promises Titi that he will 
 find what he needs to contribute to the war effort the next morning, ‘just like at Christmas’. After a 
 sleepless night, Little Titi is sorely disappointed when he finds his chimney full of scrap metal. Crying
 in the middle of this pile of junk, Titi thinks that the fairy has tricked him. She then reappears and 
 shows Titi that she had indeed granted him his wish: ‘Silly boy [...] don’t you know what this old metal
 can do? This old pot will become part of a glorious airplane [...] This horseshoe, this old inkwell, 
 will be a modern battleship tomorrow, or even a submarine’. Delighted, Titi gathers his friends and tells
 them what the fairy had taught him. Then they collect scrap metal and bring it to the train station where
 the station chief weighs it and pays Titi and his friends for their efforts. The message: children should
 put their selfish desires aside and work selflessly to produce armaments for the war effort.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Yet this tale of self-sacrifice for the greater good of military production conflicted with prevailing
 propaganda that told of economic self-sufficiency in France and of material deprivation in Germany. A 
 cartoon appearing on Christmas Day in <i>Le Petit Parisien</i> entitled ‘German Christmas’ showed a malnourished
 mother and her three children, all barefoot and wearing Nazi armbands 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-210">Figure 10</a>). A single piece of bread
 lies on a table with a broken leg repaired with twine, while in the background hangs a curtain with a 
 large patch. The children sob, like Titi, in front of a chimney without presents. Above the hearth a poster
 signed by Hitler reads, ‘Father Christmas is forbidden’. The second panel shows the real beneficiaries 
 of this material deprivation. A bellicose Father Christmas with an enormous sack marked ‘Christmas presents’
 passes out planes, submarines, pistols, swords, daggers, and bombs to Goering, Hitler, and two other Nazi
 military commanders. The message: in Germany, children have been forced to give up material comfort and 
 even Christmas presents to produce more armaments. This propaganda illustrated the unmistakably hard line 
 between salvage ‘à la française’ and German salvage drives. A selfless French boy gives up Christmas in 
 order to build weapons; evil Germans ban Christmas to build weapons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a>  </p> 
 
 <p>In December and early January, the press still associated salvage and material sacrifice with Germany’s
 economic desperation. When Hitler appointed Goering as dictator of the Reich’s war economy on 6 January 1940,
 Sennep, the cartoonist for <i>Candide</i>, penned a follow-up to his previous cartoon about Goering’s suggestion 
 to melt his war medals (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-211">Figure 11</a>). In it, Goering stands in 
 a bare room, shrugging as he looks down at his
 wide chest, stripped of all but one military medal. He is telling Hitler, ‘well, I had to be an example’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a></p>

 <p>Dautry worked actively to distinguish French efforts from the forced sacrifice in Germany, in part by 
 linking it to the national mobilization of the First World War. In his public launch of the French salvage
 drive in a national radio address on the evening of 21 December 1939, he described an ‘old man’ who donated
 ‘three-hundred kilogrammes of scrap iron and wanted to join it with four artillery shells [salvaged from 
 the First World War] which he used to decorate a house-hold altar on the day of Corpus Christi’. Dautry 
 concluded with an appeal for all French to join the effort: ‘Respond to my call [...] Engage yourselves 
 in the great enterprise of national salvation, in total war [...] [that] requires every one of us to 
 give entirely to the task of victory’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Articles, advertisements, and humorous texts soon recapitulated the call to salvage scrap. One slogan 
 proclaimed, ‘The Old Serve As Well… Old Metal, Old Paper’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a> A satirical poem in the <i>Canard Enchaîné</i> 
 transformed Serruys’ earlier salvage speech into verse, using word play to describe the collection of 
 rags, leather, coal, and metal, ending with an image of the completed cycle: <blockquote>After that, this 
 shapeless mass / To Serruys, we’ll pass / So that a factory transforms it / Into airplanes and bullets / Which, 
 one day, under machine-gun and flak / Will somewhere, on our numerous fronts, turn into scrap . . . let’s 
 salvage! Let’s salvage!’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> </blockquote> </p> 
 <p>Despite the association of metal salvage with German fanaticism, people
 were nevertheless receptive to the idea. Citing Reynaud’s appeal to ‘save more and consume less’, many 
 endorsed the idea of salvage drives well before any collections had been put in place. As early as 8 December,
 a Parisian newspaper editor proposed a range of collections then asked readers for their own ideas. 
 Throughout late December and into January, readers sent letters to the editor with various suggestions. 
 One reader, who had served in the Foreign Legion in 1914, pointed out the pile of scrap iron next to the 
 new footbridge across the Seine, another indicated a stash of metal across the bridge on the Loire, RN 73, 
 near Bourbon-Lancy in Allier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a>
 Other readers suggested including German cannons sent to municipalities for 
 decoration after World War I and even the rails from discontinued tramway lines.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a>
 Just three months 
 earlier, newspapers had pointed to the German salvaging of tramway lines as an example of Germany’s desperate
 situation. One columnist struggled to square his suggestion—the collection of paper, cork, tin, copper—with
 French propaganda: ‘without going as far as the Germans [...] we can take some useful lessons from them 
 [but] England and France, with their Empires, their immense resources, do not have to transform fish bones
 into egg white, nor collect their citizens’ hair to make rugs’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a> </p>
 
 <h2>‘The Short Life of the Dautry Telegram’ </h2> 
 
 <p>Residents in rural areas particularly welcomed the opportunity to participate in the national effort, but 
 were often stymied by uncooperative officials. When the groundswell of voluntary actions by local authorities
 that Dautry had hoped for did not immediately materialize, individuals sent letters to newspapers, local 
 prefectures, and the Armaments Ministry demanding that the local mayor or prefect respond to Dautry’s call.
 One reader of <i>L’Époque</i>, an anonymous ‘war widow’, described how she had ‘copper pots and all kinds of iron,
 but isolated in a village, without neighbours, or a vehicle’ she was unable to get rid of them. She proposed
 that in each municipality the mayor set up a collection centre and household collection by truck, then 
 consolidate the metal at the cantonal and departmental level.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a>
 Another reader thought that metal should be
 collected at city hall, ‘like certain religious charities used to do’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">[100]</a>
 One widow even wrote directly to 
 Dautry’s personal secretary, requesting that mayors organize collections in smaller villages, where ‘there
 is surely copper in the houses’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">[101]</a>
 A few zealous rural mayors had organized collections early on but were 
 frustrated by a lack of detailed instructions for collection, storage, delivery, and payment.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[102]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>In mid-January, Dautry tried to access this trapped resource with usual comprehensive organization. He
 issued a press release to major daily and regional newspapers; he sent out detailed instructions to prefects,
 mayors, and presidents of chambers of commerce with twenty-five ‘frequently asked questions’; and he sent 
 a follow-up letter to prefects, encouraging them to pressure communes that had not yet organized a drive 
 and to send examples of communes where collections had been particularly successful.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[103]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Not all of these efforts were successful. One incident revealed that ministers in Paris suffered from 
 the same narrow-minded thinking exhibited by the ‘French Army authorities’, who, in the words of Marc Bloch,
 ‘never realized that the greater the number of layers that an order or a “mem” has to penetrate in the 
 course of its journey from point of origin to point of reception, the greater is the risk that it will 
 never arrive in time’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[104]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>On Saturday morning, 13 January, before leaving for London to meet with the Supreme Allied Command, Dautry
 instructed an aide to send a million telegrams to rural households throughout France asking them to donate 
 scrap metal. The idea was simple, and resembled an earlier project of his in which he sent New Year’s cards
 to mayors. But when Dautry returned to Paris the following week, he was dismayed to find that bureaucratic 
 rethinking had paralysed his telegram idea. </p> 
 
 <p>Dautry channelled his frustration by writing ‘The Short Life of the Dautry Telegram’, an ‘administrative
 fable’, that offered a blow-by-blow account of the administration’s bureaucratic inefficiency and the 
 difficulties facing collection in the countryside: </p>

 <blockquote><u>Saturday Morning</u>: The Minister decides to send to the countryside a million telegrams labelled: 
 ‘Have you thought about giving me your scrap iron? I need it. Signed Dautry’. <u>Monday Morning</u>: The Minister’s
 Cabinet decides that villagers who will receive a telegram, will open it with the terror of learning of some
 bad news, will be irritated and think that we’re playing a trick on them. Lieutenant Hekking and Mr Pupier
 decide that the telegrams would be stamped with the label: ‘Scrap Iron Salvage’. <u>Monday Afternoon</u>: General
 Dumont is received by Mr Pouzet, cabinet chief to Mr Jullien, the Postal Minister. General Dumont tells him
 about Dautry’s project. <u>Tuesday Afternoon</u>: General Dumont is received by the Postal Minister. He gives his 
 approval for the distribution of telegrams, but raises an objection to the psychological shock and proposes 
 that the telegrams be sent instead to school teachers who will give them to their students, to bring them 
 home, showing that the telegram is not real, but simulated. <u>Thursday Morning</u>: Lieutenant Hekking, accompanied 
 by General Dumont, receives two government employees of the Postal Ministry who announce that they must not
 use the telegrams because they will ‘alarm the population’, but that the Postal Minister gives his full 
 support and complete collaboration... to distribute in the Côtes-du-Nord Department 25,000 publicity cards 
 from the Armaments Ministry. After this ‘experiment’, a study will be put in place to see if it should be
 generalized... END.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">[105]</a> </blockquote>
 
 <p>The implied moral of Dautry’s fable was that a lack of political will had undermined the decisive actions
 attempted by his ministry. His fable also revealed the central administration’s sensitivity (even over-
 sensitivity) to the fears of a population separated, often without news, from loved ones on the front lines.
 Not surprisingly, the telegrams were never sent. </p> 
 
 <p>Nevertheless, Dautry’s prodding at the end of January did have an effect. Usually within days of Dautry’s
 second letter, prefects contacted their mayors. Some specifically requested (or even required) reports of 
 what mayors had done.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">[106]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>These reports revealed a wide variety of rural collection experiences. Some had not organized a local 
 collection because they were close enough to a train station or because itinerant scrap dealers had already
 passed through and collected everything the villagers had.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">[107]</a> Others simply thought that the results would be
 too insignificant even to try issuing an appeal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-108">[108]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Still others made personal visits. For example, in the Ain department, Emile Duport, the mayor of Vaux
 (638 inhabitants) and president of the local lawn bowling society, personally went to each house and asked
 residents to pile their metal nearby so that a car could pick it up on 15 February.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-109">[109]</a>
 Mayors also took 
 Dautry’s advice to mobilize children, to display posters ‘inviting all the population and particularly the
 children to begin collection’, or, as was perhaps the case for Jacques Mallouet’s village, to ask personally
 the local schoolteacher to set aside a corner of the school courtyard where the children could deposit the
 scrap metal they had collected.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-110">[110]</a> 
 If the local blacksmith had not been mobilized, he was often the one to weigh the metal. Mayors 
 arranged household collections with weekly or monthly pick-ups using horse- or hand-carts, municipal garbage 
 trucks, or even military transports. In one case, a local military commander organized 70 mayors in a collection 
 drive. Some rural communes managed to collect considerable amounts of metal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-111">[111]</a> </p>
 
 <h2>‘The zeal of a population without weakness.’ </h2>
 
 <p>Despite achieving some success in the countryside, Dautry’s message found the most resonance in cities, particularly those 
 with large metallurgical industries such as Paris, Lyon, Lille, and Le Havre. Most of the metal collected in the 
 national drive would come from urban areas, where higher populations and greater access to transportation facilitated 
 collection. Usually chambers of commerce or individual mayors took the initiative, especially in areas where regional economic 
 groupings had been 
 created.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-112">[112]</a>
 On 3 January, the mayor of Grenoble asked the prefect of Isère if he could organise a scrap iron 
 and paper drive to benefit local relief efforts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-113">[113]</a>
 Without any clear instructions from Dautry, municipalities
 informed each other about how they had organized their drives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-114">[114]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>In the Nord the coordinated efforts of mayors, business leaders, train station chiefs, and the prefect
 resulted in the earliest, and most successful, collections. Lille’s chamber of commerce had created a list 
 of metal brokers who local mayors could contact, and Lille’s <i>Service des forges</i> and Boy Scout troop offered 
 organizational support.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-115">[115]</a> On 23 and 24 January, the town of Flers, south-west of Lille, collected 3340 
 kg with a municipal garbage truck and delivered it to the nearby Croix-Wasquehal train station.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-116">[116]</a> 
 On Thursday, 1 February, the Scouts of France completed Lille’s inaugural drive with three trucks, and 
 continued the following Sunday.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-117">[117]</a>
 In the following two weeks, nearly all the suburbs of Lille had similar 
 drives. Some of these collections were quite successful.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-118">[118]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The first collection drive to make national news and merit extensive photographic coverage was undertaken
 by the high school students of the <i>Lycée Hoche</i> in Versailles. On Thursday, 8 February 1940, a zealous young 
 administrator discovered that the school had a hoard of old metal tables in a school storage room. Rather 
 than report the find to the local chamber of commerce and wait for someone to come for it, he entered a 
 chemistry class and gave an impassioned speech about ‘the machine gun, the small artillery, and the 75 
 [millimetre field gun], that arm their brothers or their fathers’. Following the official lesson plan, 
 he next explained the relationship between steel and scrap iron and asked the boys for their help in moving
 the school’s own scrap metal into the courtyard. They spent the afternoon loading andirons and iron trestle
 tables into military trucks. The collection totalled 20 tonnes, enough, according to the journalist, to make
 three tanks. The following Saturday, photographs of their effort appeared on the front pages of the <i>Figaro</i> 
 and <i>L’Époque</i>, and in the weeks to come in its coverage of the metal collection effort, the press frequently 
 reinforced the event. For the first time, the voluntary national sacrifice that Dautry had been trying to 
 elicit from the French population found visual expression (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-212">Figure 12</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-119">[119]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>‘The great battle of scrap has begun’, announced the <i>Figaro</i> on its front page the following week. The 
 article described how boy scouts, train workers, concierges, and fire fighters in the eleventh arrondissement
 in Paris loaded ‘mountains of bed frames, old pans, stoves, springs, antique armour sets, fences, rusted 
 keys, stoves and worn out helmets’ onto municipal cars, carts, and wheel barrows, proving ‘the zeal of a
 population without weakness’. According to the organizer, the drive collected 10 tonnes, mostly in the 
 form of bed frames and kitchen ranges. More photographs, cartoons, and even short jokes followed over the
 next few days as the drive extended to more Parisian neighbourhoods 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-213">Figure 13</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-120">[120]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Much of this coverage emphasized the military use of the material, associating the collection with 
 military mobilization. A cartoon in <i>Le Petit Parisien</i> showed two soldiers loading an artillery shell at 
 the front and wondering aloud if it had once been a pram or sewing machine 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-214">Figure 14</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-121">[121]</a> A cartoon by Sennep
 appeared in <i>Candide</i> featuring Goering now behind the German front lines and surrounded by soldiers who 
 protect the medals on his chest, shouting ‘Watch out! On the other side, they’re salvaging scrap metal’ 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-215">Figure 15</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-122">[122]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>News of the metal collection even reached the mobilized French soldiers on the front lines. Trench 
 papers—improvised newsletters made by and for soldiers—poked fun at the metal drives. A parody of a 
 classified ad inversed the metal collection propaganda: ‘Will purchase precious metal from bullet cartridges,
 grenades, tanks, etc’. Another trench paper’s solution for the ‘waste of munitions’ was the proposed 
 ‘boomerang shell’, that at the end of its trajectory would automatically return to where it was fired.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-123">[123]</a> </p>
 
 <p>Feature stories, editorials, and news reports depicted a unified French society contributing to a national
 effort: rural and urban, religious and secular, young and old, rich and poor. Besides mayors whose ‘symbolic
 gesture’ of solemnly ‘placing a pot, a kettle, or bowl in front of city hall’, and school teachers, who 
 seconded the mayor’s gesture, the articles mentioned the role of priests who used the garden of the 
 presbytery as a local collection centre. Examples of individual donations included both the concierge who
 donated the thirty old cooking ranges from the cellar of her apartment building and a man from the 
 countryside who donated his entire collection of antique cars. Photographs and descriptions of collected
 objects included the familiar bed frames, stoves, kitchen ranges, and vehicles, as well as horseshoes, 
 shovels, ploughs, and the iron bands used to create wine barrels.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-124">[124]</a> Generational distinctions took familiar
 forms, such as the elderly as pack rats, hoarding useless material in attics and cellars, which were scoured
 by their grandchildren, teams of scouts or school children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-125">[125]</a> One cartoon portrayed sociological diversity 
 by assigning donations by profession: the hairdresser with her curling irons, the laundress with her iron,
 the blacksmith with his horseshoe, the grocer with his tin cans, the butcher with his rifle, and the mechanic
 with three crates of old tools.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-126">[126]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>These articles framed volunteerism in ways that differed from the official arguments of economic gain and
 security. Instead, participation was a way for those on the home front to feel ‘mobilized’, especially 
 important in a ‘phony war’ with little armed conflict and a massive mobilization of soldiers: ‘The French in
 the interior know that there’s a war, but many of them still do not feel it, many feel awkward when they 
 meet soldiers on leave, acknowledging that they are not taking part in the conflict. Now they have the 
 opportunity to volunteer, to put their activity in the service of National Defence’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-127">[127]</a> Those on the home front
 could now also make sacrifices for the war effort. But the sacrifice would not be easy. </p>

 <h2>The limitations of sacrifice </h2> 

 <p>The last collection drive covered in the national press, the most successful in France, inadvertently 
 revealed sacrifice’s limitations. On 29 February, the students of Paris found a way to celebrate 
 ‘Mi-Carême’—a festival usually accompanied by student debauchery but banned because of the war—by holding 
 a festive metal collection.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-128">[128]</a> 
 Over six hundred students dressed in white coats, togas, and some brandishing
 mock cardboard cut-outs of magnets (to draw the metal out of buildings), swarmed through the Latin Quarter
 and managed to fill 100 handcarts with 100 tonnes of scrap 
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-216">Figure 16</a>).Reports described 
 students making use of their finds, donning German helmets from the First World War, wearing old suits of
 armour, and even brandishing German bayonets, antiquated rifles, and rusty swords.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-129">[129]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>By the end of April, the government discovered that many of those armaments and other items were 
 valuable artefacts. Hired experts dug through metal at triage centres and unearthed antique ploughs, axes,
 helmets, and armour that they sent to the Museum of Popular Arts and Traditions for safekeeping.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-130">[130]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, the tension between scrap and valuables took another form. Partly because of the 
 different values accorded to scrap, its collection was soon accompanied by hoarding, denunciations, and 
 theft, and reports of these incidents in the local press undermined the image of patriotic unity that 
 the press had previously conveyed. Soon after laws required the declaration of scrap metal, the Armaments
 Ministry began receiving anonymous letters indicating hidden stocks. One of these letter writers, alerted
 by the need for metal from an article in <i>Paris-Soir</i>, wrote directly to Dautry on 2 January, indicating 
 how the Poudrerie Nationale of Angoulême had at least 2000 tonnes of scrap that it had hidden when Dautry
 had visited earlier. Another would-be informant wrote to the military Intendant in the Savoie department 
 about the large stocks of rags and metal at a scrap business in St-Jean-de-Maurienne. Investigation 
 revealed that the owner had correctly declared his stocks two weeks earlier; the material had not been 
 shipped because of transportation difficulties.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-131">[131]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Those on the margins of society who made a living collecting scrap simply used the collection drives 
 as a way to continue their business. In large cities where people put out their scrap in the morning for
 residential pick-ups, these <i>chiffonniers</i> gleaned the most valuable material. In Saint-Brieuc, on 6 February,
 the police commissioner described how these ‘poor wretches’ who ‘collect in bags, among all sorts of 
 detritus, whatever has marketable value’ on the morning of the first collection drive ‘made off 
 particularly well’, despite the efforts of police specially hired to supervise the operation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-132">[132]</a> Similarly,
 in Caen, on 19 February, the second day of the collection drive, two local homeless <i>chiffonniers</i>, a 
 thirty-year-old woman and her mother, ‘well known to the local police’, rummaged through the household 
 scrap put out for the municipal pick-up and found copper, zinc, and aluminium that they sold for 80 
 francs to a second-hand goods dealer. Both were arrested. During the same drive, a painting contractor 
 had left out two old car radiators and a used paint mixer worth 2000 francs; these were stolen before 
 the salvage trucks arrived.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-133">[133]</a> A week later, in nearby Banville, seven unidentified 
thieves, two women and five men, loaded 400 kg of metal into a truck and drove off to Caen where they probably 
sold it to a scrap dealer.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-134">[134]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>In other cases of collection difficulty, those employed to load and sort donated metal saw and exploited
 a lucrative opportunity. In Caen, on the first day of a collection drive that netted 80 tonnes, two 
 workers pilfered valuable metal such as zinc and sold it for 35 francs. They returned with a 
 bicycle frame and wheels to sell, but were met by two local police officers and arrested.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-135">[135]</a> Similarly, 
 during the first week of the scrap drive in Lyon, an unemployed truck driver hired to drive one of 
 Lyon’s collection trucks tried to sell three old washing machines, a stove, and 40 kg of 
 bronze on the side. He was discovered trying to sell collection goods, denounced, and arrested.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-136">[136]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>Though many dealers in second-hand goods (<i>brocanteurs</i>) undoubtedly profited as middle-men in the 
 trade of stolen metal, others who traded in scrap metal saw their livelihoods threatened. In Douvres-
 la-Delivrande, near Caen, the local scrap metal drive provoked the ire of a <i>brocanteur</i> who, during the
 course of the collection, publicly berated the participants and questioned the real destination and 
 use of the scrap. The gendarmes supervising the collection slapped him with a fine for ‘subversive language’,
 and even worse, the local section of <i>L’Ouest-Éclair</i> published his full name, age, and street address.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-137">[137]</a> </p>

 <p>Incidents like this were not uncommon. An altercation in early March 1940 between a young primary 
 schoolteacher and the father of one her pupils stands out in a particularly illustrative way. It reveals
 how the collection drive produced tensions between the local and national community, between definitions
 of ‘scrap’ and ‘valuables’, between men and women, mobilized and unmobilized, farmers and city-dwellers.
 On 3 March, in the small Tarnais village of Lapeyrière, forty-two-year-old Norbert Vilettes was outside 
 the <i>bureau de tabac</i> when he encountered Lucienne Mazens, his son’s schoolteacher. Vilettes, who had 
 apparently had too much to drink, publicly berated Mazen’s encouragement of the schoolchildren to 
 participate in the scrap metal campaign as ‘worthless’, and told her, ‘my son isn’t going to school to 
 learn how to be a thief. Collecting scrap metal is encouraging children to steal, and you can go tell 
 that to your Education Minister’. Madame Mazens, incensed, replied that she was ‘simply following orders’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-138">[138]</a></p>

 <p>That evening she described the events in a letter to her superior, the local elementary educational 
 inspector. She acknowledged that some children had taken a pile of metal in front of the local blacksmith’s
 shop, believing it to be set out for collection, and they had returned it. But she felt Vilettes’ comments,
 coming from somebody who had been ‘temporarily discharged’ from military service, to be both personally 
 insulting and seditious: ‘Because I’m obeying my superiors, because I’m doing my duty, I’m corrupting youth
 and inciting them to steal?!!’. Her protest went up the chain of command to the regional academic inspector
 and then to the prefect, who recommended an investigation to make sure that Vilettes had a clear 
 understanding of his ‘duties’. </p> 
 
 <p>The gendarmes’ investigation more or less confirmed the facts, with the added information that Vilettes’
 son, with three other students, had broken into an unoccupied house to collect metal and that Vilettes 
 himself had previously donated two bags of metal scrap at the beginning of the drive. Vilettes was not 
 accused of ‘subversive language’, most likely because the local mayor described him as an honest property
 owner and winegrower who, though he produced ‘a lot of white wine’, perhaps ‘liked the product of his 
 work a bit too much’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-139">[139]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>This incident reveals how many saw collection drives as part of the military mobilization effort. It 
 was no accident that Mazens used military language to describe her role. The investigation also revealed
 that her husband was mobilized on the front lines.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-140">[140]</a>
 When she herself was questioned by the gendarmes, she 
 replied, <blockquote>It is unfortunate to see that while some give their lives for the country, there are others 
 behind the front, who, not satisfied with luxuriating in the safety of their homes, hamper, with their 
 unsuitable and injurious words, the coordinating efforts of those working for everybody’s protection 
 who conscientiously execute their given orders.</blockquote> Her language echoed the propaganda arguments in the 
 lesson plan, emphasizing that the metal would be used to protect not only soldiers on the front but also
 citizens behind the lines. Her visceral response to Vilettes’ criticism suggests the level of anxiety 
 that she herself felt about her husband’s mobilization. Understandably. During March 1940, a full-scale
 German assault was becoming increasingly likely. </p>
 
 <h2>Scrap of Defeat </h2> 
 
 <p>When Jacques Mallouet wrote his memoirs in 2001, he had a clear memory of the posters in his classroom
 and his metal collection efforts, but he had difficulty assigning a precise date to that memory. He guessed
 early April, when the Germans invaded Norway and Denmark, the Franco-British expeditionary force 
 disembarked near Narvik, and Paul Reynaud, in a bold public lie, declared that the French forces had ‘cut
 off the iron road’. In his memoirs, Mallouet explained the scrap metal drive as a logical consequence of
 these military actions: ‘The Norwegian iron being inaccessible, there was no choice but to fall back on 
 local resources’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-141">[141]</a>
 Mallouet’s memory, though not a completely accurate description of the origin of the 
 drive, does underline how events in Scandinavia shaped the perception of the metal drive. </p> 
 
 <p>While Dautry’s foreign purchases of nickel, copper, and bronze continued to increase French reserves 
 throughout the spring of 1940—attested in hand-drawn graphs projecting increases through the summer and
 fall—the question of German access to iron continued to worry the administration.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-142">[142]</a> The decision to 
 intervene in Norway, tabled earlier in December, was picked up after the end of the Russo-Finnish war 
 in late March. Faced with the growing fears that time was not on the side of the Allies, Reynaud, with 
 Dautry’s urging, opted for an attack on Germany’s iron supply by mining Norwegian waters.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-143">[143]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>The press followed this problem closely.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-144">[144]</a> On 14 March, <i>Match</i> published an article on the Allied 
 blockade’s success with a diagram visually representing the percentage of German imports blocked: 100%
 for rubber, chocolate, and coffee, 72% for copper, but only 35% for iron. The last figure offered powerful 
 evidence for why the Allies needed to ‘cut-off the iron road’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-145">[145]</a>
 After the German surprise invasion of Norway on 9 April, articles, with accompanying 
 explanatory maps, detailed Allied efforts to limit Germany’s iron supply. One editorial reassured readers
 that German scrap salvage and the resources of Poland and Austria had been unable to meet the demands 
 of the German armaments industry, and that the largest deposit outside of Sweden and Norway was in northern
 France, safely behind the Maginot Line.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-146">[146]</a>
 By the end of April, it was clear that, counter to Reynaud’s 
 earlier confident assertions, Germany had complete control of Norway and Sweden’s iron supply. </p> 
 
 <p>Yet French propaganda continued to stress Germany’s deficiency in material resources. On 9 May 1940, 
 the day before the German invasion of Belgium, the crossword puzzle of <i>Match</i> indicated just how pervasive
 this understanding of Germany was. The clue for number one across was ‘Les Allemands recherchent les 
 premières’ (The Germans are searching for raw/first) and the eight word answer was ‘matières’ (materials)
 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-217">Figure 17</a>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-147">[147]</a> The next day, it would be obvious where Germany was 
intent on finding these much needed resources. </p> 
 
 <p>As German troops prepared to invade France, the collection drives continued to be plagued with 
 transportation difficulties, especially from the initial collection areas of schools or city halls 
 to triage centres. Neither Dautry’s appeals for volunteer labour, for donated vehicles, for the use
 of military troops nor Dautry’s assertions in newspaper articles that ‘salvaged scrap iron [was] 
 already producing cannons and shells’ could lift spirits once they began to fall, of frustrated 
 mayors, landlords, school principals, and children, like those in the tiny village of Vieux, whose 
 covered playground was unfit for any use, filled to capacity and blocked as it was with scrap metal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-148">[148]</a> </p>

 <p>The mayor of Rennes, whose drives in February and March had already successfully shipped 85 tonnes 
 of metal, received notice at the beginning of April that, because the SNCF was no longer allowed 
 to ship metal to ‘bogged down factories’, the city would have to find an alternate storage site.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-149">[149]</a> The
 35 tonnes they collected in April, temporarily stored at the station, finally was jettisoned 
 onto an embankment, unpaid for and uncounted.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-150">[150]</a>
 Among the last letters to the editor about salvage 
 appearing in <i>L’Epoque</i> came from an unidentified mayor. Described was how he had collected 25 to 
 30 tonnes of scrap metal that was stored at the local train station, awaiting pick up, but 
 the station chief, unable to get a train car since January, had to refuse more donations. Dismayed, 
 the mayor reported having his metal thrown back into the local garbage dump. His explanation for this
 ‘shambols’ (<i>pagaie</i>) was simple, the French government had ‘neglected to create enough foundries to
 process the metal (there were only two) and that had immobilized thousands of train cars now waiting 
 in depots’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-151">[151]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>He was absolutely right. The GIAF produced a dire report on the collection drive at the beginning of 
 April that confirmed these transportation difficulties and raised even more fundamental problems. Mayors,
 teachers, concierges, and SNCF station masters throughout France described a system that had completely
 broken down. The SNCF had no more room on platforms, train cars could not be loaded because they had 
 been reserved for military transport, and those that had been loaded, needed to wait. Worse yet, salvage
 yards, where metal was processed for re-sale, did not have enough manpower to unload and sort the 
 delivered metal. Further, the loading apertures on French furnaces required the material to be compressed
 in small packets, but France lacked enough compressors to do so.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-152">[152]</a> Even when scrap had been 
 successfully processed, companies often refused to use it because of its inferior quality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-153">[153]</a> 
 The GIAF estimated that, of the 85,000 tonnes of metal collected by the end of May, only 45,000 tonnes
 had made it to triage centres, leaving 40,000 tonnes on railway platforms and at local collection 
 centres.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-154">[154]</a> </p> 
 
 <p>These piles of metal, and the collection drive itself, soon came to symbolise French weakness. 
 One soldier on leave, Georges Sadoul, noted in his diary at the end of April, that at the train station
 of Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuses he had seen ‘a large pile of recently collected scrap metal’, and above 
 that was a poster reading, ‘With your scrap iron we will forge the steel of victory’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-155">[155]</a> On 16 June, 
 after his convoy was strafed by Italian bombers outside of Sully-sur-Loire, Sadoul and his fellow 
 soldiers took refuge in a nearby forest. In his diary, Sadoul recorded what was said there: <blockquote>In 
 the woods, I hear some of my comrades interminably repeating, with increasing rage, Paul Reynaud’s
 slogans: ‘With your scrap iron we will forge the steel of victory!’ Others continued with even 
 louder and more furious voices: ‘We will win because we are the strongest’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-156">[156]</a></blockquote> </p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, Wehrmacht troops were securing French copper, lead, tin, nickel, and iron reserves
 in the state arsenals of Bourges, Le Havre, and Bordeaux and confiscating the piles of scrap metal 
 left on railway platforms, in front of city halls, and in local schoolyards. Over the next four 
 years they would use French scrap to forge their own ‘steel of victory’. </p>
 
 <h2>Conclusion </h2> 
 
 <p>Raoul Dautry’s failed attempt to mobilize French scrap iron in the winter and spring of 1940 has 
 understandably been neglected by historians. Yet this marginal event, barely a footnote in France’s 
 catastrophic defeat, illuminates much about French society at war in the months preceding the German 
 invasion. This analysis of how and why the drive was put in place, the propaganda arguments used to 
 justify it, and the logistics of its implementation certainly reveals ample evidence of disorganization, 
 discord, and apathy. Historians may disagree whether or not France ‘was the strongest’ in September 
 1939, but France’s leaders certainly did not believe it. The crisis in scrap iron faced by French 
 factories in the early months of the war is just one example of the dismal state of France’s industrial
 mobilization. The difficulties faced by Dautry in putting the drive in place and in getting the 
 collected metal to factories seem to confirm Talbot Imlay’s conclusion that France ‘lacked the economic
 structure needed for a long war’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-157">[157]</a>
 During the Vichy regime, the failed collection drive came to 
 symbolize French weakness—a sign of the ‘decadent’ Third Republic and its inability to effectively 
 mobilize against Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-158">[158]</a>
 This imagery persisted in memoirs such as those by Jacques Mallouet. </p> 
 
 <p>Yet this is not the whole picture. If France had more successfully fended off Germany’s invasion, 
 it is likely that the collection drive would be remembered as a resounding victory of the French 
 people, a victory led by the heroic Raoul Dautry. Indeed, Dautry’s leadership offers a strong 
 corrective to the indecision of the sclerotic bureaucrats and military officers that pepper accounts 
 of France’s defeat. If France had been able to fight a ‘long war’ with Germany, Dautry might have 
 been able to fashion a more effective industrial mobilization.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-159">[159]</a> Historians have shown that the German
 economic organization so admired and feared by men like Dautry and Reynaud was arguably as disorganized
 and chaotic as the French Armaments Ministry.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-160">[160]</a> </p>
 
 <p>Despite all the logistical hurdles, the French people responded with enthusiasm. The metal collection
 propaganda so derided in post-war accounts resonated with many French men, women, and children who—in 
 the words of Daniel Hucker—suffered from ‘next war anxiety’ rather than defeatism or ‘visceral pacism’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-161">[161]</a> 
 In the winter and spring of 1940, rural collection efforts galvanized local populations and provided them
 a way to link the home front with the front lines. Teachers were key to this mobilization. Despite a 
 long line of scholarship blaming the teaching profession for training a generation of pacifists unwilling
 to defend France, the examples of Monsieur Chaussade, Madame Viala, or Madame Mazens support historian 
 Mona Siegel’s conclusion that teachers rallied to the flag in 1939 and 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-162">[162]</a> It was only with the fall
 of France that Dautry’s steel of victory became the scrap of defeat. </p>
