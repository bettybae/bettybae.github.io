	<p><b>[PAGE 50]</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Liberation</p><p>Freedom, hope and relief</b></p><p><blockquote>Liberation was to be a new dawn: ‘<i>Ici commence…</i>’<br><br>Roderick Kedward<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></blockquote></p><p>‘By 1944,’ in the words of McMillan, ‘it was certain that the Reich would not last a thousand years.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> As an event, the Liberation has elicited an array of verdicts and epithets. For Beevor and Cooper, it was all about ‘love-making’ and ‘drinking’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> This may well be a romantic simplication, but it does convey the essence of the end-of-war occupation atmosphere: a mixture of jubilation, ecstasy and delirium. For Kedward and Wood, the Liberation was, rather, a profound and multifaceted phenomenon, with ramifications in all kinds of spheres: gender and overseas France to name but two.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> McMillan argues simply that through the Liberation ‘France was delivered from four years of bondage’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a></p><p>Whichever assessment one accepts, it is clear that this was an epoch-defining moment: like 1789, a landmark in French history whose significance and importance can be viewed in a whole range of different arenas. It is tempting to see the Liberation as an ‘ending’—a fullstop that marks the termination of the wartime period. However, in a sense, the Liberation was much more than that, and should perhaps be viewed as a ‘beginning’. (To keep the punctuation metaphor going: it could be seen as the start of a new sentence rather than the final stages of an old one.)</p><p>It is also very easy to fall into another trap: to believe that the Liberation was exclusively about joy, elation and untrammelled freedom, and to overlook the fact that, in reality, the years 1944, 1945 and 1946 were extremely difficult. Of course the Liberation period incorporated bliss and exultation, but it was also synonymous with violence and national division. It was a time, moreover, of wholesale recriminations; there was a constant fear of civil war and an ever-present awareness that France, if she was to survive in the post-war world, would have to put all her energy into national economic reconstruction. In this sense, the Liberation was a time of great trauma and tribulation, and not just unadulterated happiness and relief.</p><p>This chapter will narrate the main phases of the Liberation and then assess whether it was a specific event that can be linked to a time and place or whether it was more of an evolutionary process. It will also explore the interrelations, after 1944, between de Gaulle, the Free French, the forces of the internal resistance, the Allies and the ordinary French people. More specifically, the debate about who, or what combination of forces, actually achieved the Liberation will be considered. Was it de Gaulle who roused the nation into self-expression or was the contribution of the Allies the crucial ingredient in 1944? What role did the internal resistance play? We also need to be aware of two other debates: how was power transmitted in 1944, and in what kind of state did France emerge from the Liberation?</p><p>Beyond these issues, it will be interesting and necessary to explore the main themes that underpin the Liberation period. Hope, uncertainty, renaissance, unity, division, retribution, reconstruction were just some of these themes. What was their meaning and significance?</p><p><b>The process</b></p><p>It is commonplace to reduce the Liberation to one glorious and specific event.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> Many onlookers take 26 August 1944 and de Gaulle’s procession down the Champs d’Elysées as that one ‘moment’: the point in time—laced with symbolism—when freedom became a reality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> It is natural, and to a certain extent predictable, that historians, and other onlookers, should desire—and actually locate—a defining moment for everything that the Liberation represented. And de Gaulle’s famous Parisian stroll seems the ideal candidate. However, the Liberation of France was a complex process with a variety of intermediate phases and a series of significant dates:</p><p>8 November 1942 The Allies land in North Africa—the liberation of Algeria. 18 March 1943 Algeria is declared independent of the Vichy regime. October 1943 The liberation of Corsica. 6 June 1944 The Allies land in Normandy. 25 August 1944 Paris is liberated. September 1944 De Gaulle sets up the <i>Gouvernement Provisoire de la Republic Française </i> (GPRF)—the ‘Government of National Unanimity’. 7 September 1944 Pétain and Laval are captured and taken to Sigmaringen in Germany. 15 September 1944 Special courts are organised for the <i>L’Épuration</i> (the purges). 23 October 1944 De Gaulle’s GPRF is recognised by the Allies. July/August 1945 The trial and sentence of Pétain. January 1946 De Gaulle resigns as President of the GPRF after his draft constitution is rejected—he creates a ‘non-party’ <i>Rassemblement du Peuple Français </i> (RPF). April/May 1946 Municipal elections are held. October 1946 The Fourth Republic is established; Laval is tried and sentenced; legislative elections take place.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> <b>[PAGE 52] </b></p><p>It could be argued that the Liberation process straddled all the above events: from the ‘mini-liberations’ of 1942 and 1943 to the legal and constitutional developments of 1944 and 1946.</p><p>For Kedward the key to the issue is territory. He argues that the Liberation amounted to a series of small but significant advances:</p><p><blockquote>The Liberation of France is first and foremost about territory, specific territory. It is about the fight for territory, and the reclaiming of territory. On 2 June 1944 this territory begins at Paulhac-en-Margeride. On 6 June 1944 it begins on the Normandy beaches; on 8 June, momentarily and tragically, it begins at Tulle in the Corrèze; on 15 August on the rugged coastline of Provence. It had already begun earlier, in November 1942 in Algeria, and in October 1943 in Corsica.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a></blockquote></p><p>‘Mini-liberations’ were happening all over France in the months preceding August 1944 (e.g. Corsica and Algeria)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> and even after de Gaulle’s famous promenade in Paris there was still work to be done. In this sense it is more accurate to think of the Liberation of a France as a process, not as a moment. Kedward and Wood agree, arguing that the Liberation was characterised, first and foremost, by ‘diversity’ and ‘plurality’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Ousby sums this view up neatly:</p><p><blockquote>Step by step, the occupiers were forced out of France in the last six months of 1944. There was no national date for liberation. Each town and village still celebrates a different date, the gaps between them marking advances that often looked bogged down, pockets of German defence that often turned out to be unexpectedly tough.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a></blockquote></p><p>Whatever its exact parameters, the Liberation was a reality. Throughout 1944 the CNR had been planning for the moment. It demanded political unity and economic reform. As it announced: ‘A new Republic will be founded, which will sweep away the reactionary regime of Vichy and return to our democratic and popular institutions the power which they lost through the corrupting and treasonous activity that preceded the surrender.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a></p><p><b>Transfer of power</b></p><p>The transfer of power at the Liberation was always going to be a delicate process. As Larkin puts it: The Allied invasion of France confronted both Vichy and de Gaulle with the problem of contriving a transfer of power which would respect order and legitimacy yet would leave the balance of moral dignity with oneself rather than with the other side.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Footitt and Simmonds are particularly interested in the way that power ‘on the ground’ was claimed, and distributed, in 1944. They paint a picture of a France that was hopelessly confused: myriad local Liberation committees, significant regional variations, and a situation in which the Allies were gradually, and <i>willingly</i>, retreating—thus leaving the field open to de Gaulle, the FFI, and other new organisations and authorities. Though <b>[PAGE 53]</b> de Gaulle might present it otherwise, the transition of power was ‘piecemeal’ and far from seamless.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a></p><p>Adjacent to this issue is the question of who was responsible for the Liberation. Kedward states in the introduction to <i>The Liberation of France</i>:</p><p><blockquote>Studies of the Liberation are complicated and sustained by the unending arguments about agency. These are due not only to rivalry between different strands within the Resistance narrative but also to the pivotal role of the allied <i>débarquements</i>. Tears welled up in the eyes of Pierre Boyer, a grain merchant in Saint-Affrique in the Aveyron, when he described the rows of American, British and Canadian graves in Normandy. He had been a <i>maquisard</i> at the liberation of Montpellier, but in 1991 he stated unequivocally that the French only participated in the national liberation. Ultimately, he said, they owed everything to the invading Allies. And what of the debts, less often recognised, to the troops from Algeria, Morocco, West and Equatorial Africa, and more distant French colonies, who fought in the liberating armies? The overwhelming case that France could only be liberated by invasion has never seriously been contested, and it is certainly not the intention of this book to do so, though the huge cost in French civilian lives, as well as Allied military lives, has to be confronted.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a></blockquote></p><p>The debate about agency is a complex one. It involves questions of political and military responsibility and, as Footitt and Simmonds make plain, it has always been affected by partisan concerns:</p><p><blockquote>By and large, Anglo-Saxon historians concentrate almost exclusively on the role of the Allies; their armies, their civil affairs officers, their political leaders and so on, with walk-on parts for the Free French and the Resistance…French historians on the other hand have devoted most of their attention to the role of the Resistance in the Liberation, giving little place to the Allies.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a></blockquote></p><p>This is an important point to note. More than most historical debates, the one surrounding the Liberation of France is cloaked in polemic, bias and myths. This is not surprising. So much was at stake in the Liberation, and so much depends on its legacy, that writers and rewriters of history have seized the opportunity to impose their own views.</p><p>Some writers have ascribed all to de Gaulle. The argument put forward is that de Gaulle ignited the flame of resistance; he was the key anti-Vichy and anti-German figurehead; he was the man who emerged to symbolise the reality of the Liberation in August 1944; and thus, when one is apportioning credit, de Gaulle must take his full share. The lack of modesty evident in de Gaulle’s <i>War Memoirs</i> can also affect our judgement.</p><p>There is of course no doubt that de Gaulle was a central, if not indispensable, figure in both the Resistance and the Liberation. In Algeria he had created the CFLN and, as Jackson states: ‘De Gaulle set about turning the CFLN into a government that could assume power in liberated France.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> By May 1944 the CFLN, under de Gaulle’s tutelage, had metamorphosised into the GPRF. However, the exigencies of the situation< <b>[PAGE 54]</b> de Gaulle found himself in, post-August 1944, led to him exaggerating his role in the Liberation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> In a sense it was natural for de Gaulle to overplay his involvement—he was by nature a vain and egotistical man—but in another sense it was a strategy. What de Gaulle found on his return to France in August 1944 was a nation ravaged economically and divided politically. If he wanted to inspire the country into reconstruction and revival—as he most certainly had to—he had to motivate the people of France into action and he had to make efforts to induce a feeling of hope. As Ousby says:</p><p><blockquote>Men do not become leaders by popular acclamation just through shrewd political manoeuvring, though de Gaulle had certainly proved his mastery of this skill. Nor do they become leaders by popular acclamation just through the example of their courage, though de Gaulle had certainly set this example since June 1940. They become leaders by popular acclamation if they have a vision which answers a need, deeply and widely felt, and if they have at their command the language which makes people realise how deeply and widely they feel their need of the vision. De Gaulle had both the vision and the language. To a people who had spent four years humiliated and divided he had a healing myth to offer, a myth which promised to heal humiliation and heal division, which promised even to heal history. His rhetoric conjured the myth into life.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a></blockquote></p><p>One key strategy was to tell the population that both they and he had been intrinsic to the Liberation. This, in effect, was the art of myth-making. During the war—particularly early on—de Gaulle was reluctant to plan ahead, or even to talk about, the hoped-for future.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Perhaps this was a tactic; perhaps this was a rare piece of modesty.</p><p>Whatever the nature and extent of de Gaulle’s involvement, the reality is that the people of France owed a profound debt of gratitude to the Allies—even if, at times, they may have been alarmed and put out by their arrogance. As Ousby states: Obviously it is not hard to challenge the Gaullist myth on its own, strictly historical, terms. France had not seen liberation by France, much less by the whole of France. She had been liberated by the Allied armies in which the French army formed only a minority, and by <i>résistants</i> who—though their numbers had grown as the Allied armies approached—were still, as they had always been, only a minority of the French…To offer even such a literal correction to the Gaullist myth is already to indicate the problems confronting de Gaulle.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a></p><p>We know that the wartime relationship between de Gaulle and the Allied powers had never been cordial, and by 1944 it had deteriorated further. While de Gaulle saw the need to have one single French authority, the Americans had their own blueprint for France’s future; at the same time they made it known that they would liaise with whatever French authorities they discovered <i>in situ</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a></p><p>In 1944 there was a point when Allied military leaders sought to minimise the involvement of de Gaulle and the indigenous French forces and to by-pass Paris in the military operation that ultimately brought liberation. Price argues that France’s role in the Liberation was, all in all, ‘limited’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> <b>[PAGE 55] </b></p><p>It is also clear that tension between de Gaulle and the Allies carried over into the arena of practicalities:</p><p><blockquote>Roosevelt’s intention was that liberated France should be administered by an American military administraton (AMGOT) and to this end American officials were receiving crash courses at Charlottesville in how to become French administrators; de Gaulle meanwhile was preparing his own lists of ‘Commissioners of the Republic’ who would represent the GPRF in liberated France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a></blockquote></p><p>This was not just a case of two different conceptions of the Liberation; this was a case of mutual hostility and antagonism. As McMillan has written: ‘De Gaulle and the Free French abhorred the idea that not only might France be liberated solely by American and British troops but, even worse, the liberated <i>patrie</i> would be placed under an Allied Military Government of the Occupied Territories, as in the case of Sicily in 1943.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> De Gaulle’s will may have eventually triumphed—AMGOT was ‘stillborn’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>—but the fact is that each ‘side’ was extremely unsure about the other’s intentions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> This just added to the confusion and uncertainty.</p><p>We should also take account of the internal resistance and its role in 1944. Anarchic and unpredictable they may have been, but the France-based forces always believed that they would be a key part of the equation when the <i>dénouement</i> came. But, however much of a nuisance they caused, they could never escape the reality that both de Gaulle and the Allies looked down their noses at them. Kedward says that the FTPF, in particular, complained about the ‘cautious’ and ‘submissive’ role that others had delineated for them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> McMillan states:</p><p><blockquote>In planning the Liberation of Europe, the Allied strategists, in particular the Americans, had attached little importance to the contribution that internal resistance movements might make to freeing their own countries. Their role was to be confined to sabotaging German reinforcements and providing useful local intelligence. For leaders of the French Resistance such a role was deemed to be far from adequate to expunge the cruel memories of 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a></blockquote></p><p>The debate about agency is long-running. As Kedward argues, ‘“Liberation by whom?” is not just a post-war controversy about the relative merits of Allied invasion, on the one hand, and arming the Maquis, on the other; it was an issue which occupied people’s minds long before the summer of 1944.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> What was the role of de Gaulle? What was the role of the Allies? What was the role of the ordinary French people? These questions were being asked throughout 1944 and 1945; after the Liberation, the same questions were being asked. Perhaps the best strategy is Footitt and Simmonds’; they conclude that, ‘there was not one Liberation of France but many.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a></p><p>In the aftermath of the Liberation a series of US posters tried to suggest that the Franco-American relationship was healthy and harmonious—and always had been. One announced: ‘A LA FRANCE ÉTERNELLE SES AMIS, SES ALLIES’; another: ‘LIBERTÉ, EGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ …ENFIN.’ A third was even more positive in its depiction of the relationship. It showed an American military policeman and a shapely <b>[PAGE 56]</b> French woman smiling massively as they travelled together by motor-bike. The caption read: ‘ENTENTE CORDIALE…!’ These images idealised a diplomatic relationship which, in reality, was far from cordial.</p><p><b>Themes and cross-currents</b></p><p>If the process of the Liberation period is interesting and significant, the underlying themes are even more fascinating.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> For, as much as at any other time in French history— if not more—there were fierce cross-currents running beneath the surface of political life. They influenced all aspects of society and they affected the fears and aspirations of ordinary people. If one analyses the nature, tone and emphases of the new authorities’ propaganda and publicity, one cannot help but be struck by the emphasis on certain themes and sentiments which add up to a significant statement about the nature of the French psyche c. 1944. Barber puts it nicely. He says that France and the French people were ‘split between the impulse to explore the implications of calamity and to proceed as if nothing had gone wrong’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a></p><p>The most obvious theme was hope. After four years of darkness and hopelessness, there was, in the weeks and months following August 1944, a genuine sense of optimism. On the streets of French towns and cities there were celebrations and parties: a signal that hope had been restored. Price talks about the ‘expectancy’ in France and the desire for ‘a new beginning’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> The feeling was that hope and enthusiasm had triumphed over apathy and resentment. It is in this sense that some historians have talked about the Liberation as a ‘<i>fête</i>’ or a ‘carnival’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> Similarly, even though there was a fear of chaos and civil war, the belief was that somehow France <i>had to</i> survive. But twinned with hope was, perhaps, a more heartfelt sense of relief. After more than a thou sand days of curfews and shortages, and Germans patrolling the streets, France once again was free. It is significant that de Gaulle entitles Volume 3 of his <i>War Memoirs</i>—the tome that dealt with the Liberation period—‘Salvation’. There was, most certainly, something spiritual and almost mystical about the Liberation experience.</p><p>The themes of hope and relief are very evident in official GPRF posters issued during 1944–45. In one, a woman standing on a special platform is lifting her arms to the skies; and behind her a large group of people are doing likewise. The look on her face suggests that she is happy, thankful, and hopeful. Another government-sponsored image is more ambiguous. It features a woman peering into the distance; she is looking into some kind of haze and is depicted raising her hand to her forehead. It is as if she is mopping her brow in relief—or shielding her eyes and her face from what she perhaps views as future problems for France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> Whatever their exact meaning, these two images are suggestive of the state of the French psyche in 1944 and 1945.</p><p>Hope and relief were central to the French mindset in 1944. We should not overlook the fact, however, that the nation was in a state of flux—not unnaturally, of course, given the turbulence of the wartime years. On many issues, there was serious uncertainty: How should post-Liberation France be governed? What was the best way to treat the wartime collaborators? How, and at what speed, should France rebuild?</p><p>For Kedward, the Liberation was an ‘opening and a closure’, a land-mark period in <b>[PAGE 57]</b> which France ‘looked backwards and forwards’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> It marked the end of German occupation and it saw the start of important social and economic developments. Women were rewarded for their wartime efforts with the vote. The communists advertised their yearning for some kind of ‘national insurrection’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> More generally, the Liberation meant a start to economic reconstruction and what Price has called ‘a massive social revolution’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a></p><p>There was also a growing feeling that France after 1944, in economic and political terms, was being born again. The key word was ‘revolution’. Kedward dwells on this point:</p><p><blockquote>In his celebrated, but Delphic, message to the internal Resistance in June 1942, General de Gaulle claimed that ‘<i>le peuple français</i>’ had condemned both the pre-War Republic and the Vichy regime, and he added, ‘<i>Tandis qu’il s’unit pour la victoire, il s’assemble pour une revolution</i>.’ Wresting the concept and promise of revolutionary change away from Vichy’s ‘<i>Revolution nationale</i>’ was one of the major recuperative aims of Resistance writing and action, inside and outside France. The term ‘<i>liberation</i>’ remained a stronger mobilising concept than the term ‘<i>révolution</i>’, but the two shared many column inches in the clandestine press as if they were synonymous. Liberation was to be a new dawn: ‘<i>Ici commence…</i>’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a></blockquote></p><p>There was not only a new political elite, but in time a new republican regime and a new set of parties and factions. Allusions to 1789 were common and revolutionary symbolism became fashionable once more. Kedward writes:</p><p><blockquote>The picture emerges of a period of euphoria when Resisters bridged the local vacuum of power with an assertive display of popular, patriotic ideals, setting up local committees to administer supplies, to organise recruitment for the army, and to relaunch their committees on a more equal, just and fraternal footing. There have been few occasions in French history since 1789 when the slogans of the Revolution have commanded such universal respect. For a month at least, before the weight of restructuring the economy and continuing the war began to sap people’s optimism, there was a widespread belief that French society could be recast to give equal opportunities to everyone. It was an ideal to which resisters look back with pride. It was a period, say many, when very ordinary men and women were momentarily in charge of their own history.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a></blockquote></p><p>Revolutionary imagery is particularly evident in the celebratory posters published by the GPRF in August 1944. Two in particular are worthy of note. One, under the word ‘LIBÉRATION’, features a French-style Statue of Liberty; the inscription on the plinth reads ‘LA FAYETTE’. Another features a Frenchwoman in classical revolutionary garb; the slogan swirling in the sky reads ‘LIBERTÉ’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> The new French authorities were keen to assert that 1944 and 1789 were part of the same lineage: they both represented freedom and liberation.</p><p>The Liberation gave a strong impetus to artistic creativity. In the same way as the Occupation inspired writers and painters, so the Liberation, as a period and process, <b>[PAGE 58]</b> galvanised artists and intellectuals. As Barber writes:</p><p><blockquote>A burning moment of absolute anger and desolation in human history creates extraordinary impulses which remain with us and provoke, haunt and harass us. The Liberation of Paris in August 1944 and its aftermath is one such moment… It was a period of Europe’s most intense and most creative self-exploration… After years of suppression and silence, liberated Paris was a vocal and visual eruption of cacophonic and panoramic dimensions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a></blockquote></p><p>Barber goes further and talks about ‘weapons of liberation’. In Paris, in 1944, he identifies ‘weapons of art, weapons of performance and weapons of writing.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> Barber highlights the creative work of Genet, Giaconetti and Dubuffet in particular and argues that during the war France had not only suffered military invasion but, ‘had been subjugated by language as well.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a></p><p><b>The purges</b></p><p>If there was something bright and healthy about the French attitude to liberation and revival, there was also something dark and sinister lurking within the French body politic. This, after all, was the era of the purges: an attempt to eradicate collaborators and collaborationists who had survived the war. From executions to beatings and headshavings, <i>l’Épuration</i> was an exercise in vengeance. At times this campaign was organised and formal; at others anarchic and chaotic.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> Ousby suggests there were two main phases of <i>l’Épuration</i>: ‘rough justice’ (1944) and ‘the official creation of special courts’ (mid-September 1944 onwards).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> It would be accurate to look upon the <i>l’Épuration</i> as another element—albeit the most bloody—in ‘<i>la guerre franco-française</i>’, the spectre of which was to dominate and haunt France throughout the 1940s.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a></p><p>It was perhaps inevitable that the sequel to war, occupation, collaboration and resistance would be blood-letting and a period of wholesale recriminations. The wartime era had been an emotional rollercoaster for France. After the Liberation France had to mete out a necessary amount of justice or, rather, had to be <i>seen</i> to be meting out a necessary amount of justice. As Ousby declares: ‘Disaffected <i>résistants</i> on the one side and tainted <i>collabos</i> on the other, both required a firm hand. “Nothing can be done except through order”, de Gaulle insisted.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> This was a tricky dilemma: punish too few collaborators and risk minimising the ‘crime’ of collaboration; punish too many and risk depicting France as a nation of collaborators—just when de Gaulle had a political interest in promoting the idea of unity and France as a ‘nation of resisters’.</p><p>Even though Barber argues that ‘Paris was a city obsessed with violence’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> the general historical view is that <i>l’Épuration</i> was decidedly lenient. De Gaulle and the post-war authorities understood that they had to make an example of the most notorious collaborators—like Pétain and Laval—but in the end they shied away from a more comprehensive purge. They made great play of dealing with the most notorious offenders—but they left it at that.</p><p>So, in many ways the post-war purge was aimed only at identifying, and then punishing, a suitable—and smallish—number of people. Pétain and Laval were brought <b>[PAGE 59]</b> back to France for trial; they, along with people like Brasillach, were extremely useful high-profile scape-goats. As Beevor and Cooper argue: ‘France knew that it could not face the post-war world until accounts had been settled with Marshal Pétain and Pierre Laval.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> In the end, and altogether, there were ‘100,000–150,000 deaths’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> between 1942 and 1945. That said, the years of <i>l’Épuration</i> were extremely chaotic and anarchic, making it difficult to judge the scale of the post-war ‘terror’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a></p><p>The purge was, by its very nature, calculated and cynical; because if every Frenchman ‘guilty’ of an act of collaboration was prosecuted half the population of the country would probably have been indicted. Retribution was harsh, but always pragmatic. The most apt conclusion must be this: in the immediate post-war period France exhibited an extremely strong desire for ‘justice’; the process though was chaotic.</p><p>We also need to point out the relationship between <i>l’Épuration</i> and the intricate web of post-war myth-making. This link is best explained by McMillan:</p><p><blockquote>Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the <i>épuration</i> was its relative moderation. Partly this was because de Gaulle was determined to prevent the outbreak of anarchy and civil war: violence had to be curtailed and minimised and the authority of the State upheld. Partly too, it was a question of preserving the myth of <i>la France résistante</i> in the interests of national unity. Hence, collaborators could be presented as a handful of guilty men (or women) unrepresentative of the nation as a whole.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a></blockquote></p><p>And as Ousby argues: ‘In a sense the <i>épuration</i> continues today, or rather it has been resumed in the wake of Klaus Barbie’s trial in the late 1980s.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a></p><p>If, in political and legal terms, the Liberation meant <i>l’Épuration</i>, in economic terms it meant reconstruction. This topic will be discussed at length in the next chapter—because in many ways it was an ongoing consequence or legacy of the wartime period. For the time being, it is important to note that during the Liberation period, as was the case in the decade or so following 1944–45, ‘reconstruction’ was the chief buzzword. A Ministry of Reconstruction was established and a state-sponsored ‘propaganda’ campaign proclaimed the intrinsic necessity of rebuilding.</p><p>Reflecting this, publicity posters, which only a couple of years earlier had been dominated by ‘vulnerable’ female figures representing ‘invaded’, ‘occupied’ and ‘subservient’ France, were now monopolised by strong men with bulging biceps: ‘RETROUSSONS NOS MANCHES: ÇA IRA ENCORE MIEUX!’, ‘LES SOLDATS DONNENT LEUR SANG! LES METAL-LOS OFFRENT LEURS BRAS! TOUS AU TRAVAIL.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> In this new selection of posters, the economic challenge facing France in the Liberation years and beyond was likened, explicitly, to the military challenge that had faced the country between 1940 and 1944. Political and judicial adjustments had been made by the new liberation authorities; it was now time for the economy to take centre stage. <b>[PAGE 60]</b></p><p><b>Unity and disunity</b></p><p>Dalloz argues that de Gaulle had two main aims in the weeks and months following his return to France: to re-establish state authority and to monitor the purges.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a> These were his twin priorities; the General believed that if he could accomplish both, the Liberation would proceed relatively smoothly. As it was, October 1944 emerged as a landmark date: De Gaulle’s provisional government was recognised by the Allies. In the end though, there was something quite anti climactic about this moment. Throughout the war, de Gaulle had been obsessed by the notion of ‘legitimacy’—about what was, and was not, France’s ‘legitimate’ government; ironically though, when it was achieved official recognition was ‘something of a damp squib’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> Nevertheless, the Liberation was now complete: the occupiers had been removed, the task of moulding a ‘new France’ had begun, and a new political authority had been recognised. Kedward sums up the meaning of the Liberation. He says:</p><p><blockquote>For Vichy leaders, it was the moment when their subservience to Germany was fully exposed… the internal Resistance, the Liberation was the triumphal justification of Republican patriotism, of anti-fascism and a faith in the fight for freedom which had seemed ‘absurd’ in 1940…For the external Resistance, the Liberation was the moment when de Gaulle, the symbol of protest and resistance, became the embodiment of power.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a></blockquote></p><p>The Liberation was, as we have seen, a period of contrasts: hope—but at the same time uncertainty and relief; renaissance—but also retribution. The sharpest dichotomy was that between unity and division. On the one hand there was a huge and quite natural sense of unity during the Liberation and in post-Liberation France. The feeling was that the nation had emerged triumphant because of the toil of the French people and as a result of significant cross-class solidarity in the face of the occupier. The whole country, therefore, joined hands to celebrate its own success. After the war the notion of unity evolved into a very strong sense of partnership. Although there was much mutual suspicion evident in the relationship between the Gaullists and the communists in particular—the former feared a ‘socialist revolution’, the latter a ‘de Gaulle dictatorship’—the exigencies of the situation encouraged the growth of tripartism: <i>Mouvement Républicain Populaire</i> (MRP) communist-socialist ‘partnership’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> Whatever the tensions and frictions—and these were not insignificant—it was clear that Gaullists and communists-socialists had enough in common. This ‘coming together’ of traditional foes was a crucial and poignant aspect of the Liberation era.</p><p>Accompanying this feeling was an intriguing sense of continuity. It was impossible to ignore the profound dislocation that the wartime experience had brought. Despite this— or possibly because of it—de Gaulle made a point of re-occupying his old War Ministry office when he arrived back in Paris; nothing, not even a world war, was going to alter his routine. It was also curious—and significant—that the people of France opted for a new constitutional arrangement (the Fourth Republic) that was almost identical in structure to the pre-war regime (the Third Republic). Bizarrely, 96 per cent of people <b>[PAGE 61]</b> voted against the continuation of the Third Republic in a special referendum…only to vote in favour of something extremely similar (the new 1946 constitution). Perhaps subconsciously, France did not really want to change, even after the shattering experience of world war.</p><p>For many historians, post-war ‘unity’ was just an illusion. According to this view, what existed in reality was a divided country, riven by bitterness and recriminations, and held together only by the cleverness and shrewdness of de Gaulle. In fact, his notion of ‘a nation of resisters’ evolved into a strategically useful myth. It implied that ‘every-one’ was a hero and ‘everyone’, therefore, could take the credit for the Liberation of France. In many ways, this was far-fetched—but it did help de Gaulle consolidate things in and around 1944 and it did, perhaps, prevent post-war France plunging into calamitous civil war. In time, onlookers were to become extremely cynical about this myth—they were to talk about bandwagon-jumpers, ‘last-minute resisters’ and the ‘RMS’ (<i>Resistance du Mois de Septembre</i>)—but in August 1944 a unifying myth, of whatever sort, was necessary.</p>
