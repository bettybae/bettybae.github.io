<b>The 'Blank Check'</b><br><br>
<i>Telegram from the Imperial Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg, to the German Ambassador at Vienna. Tschirschky, July 6, 1914</i><br><br>

Berlin, July 6, 1914<br><br>

<i>Confidential. For Your Excellency's personal information and guidance</i><br><br>

The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador yesterday delivered to the Emperor a confidential personal
letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph, which depicts the present situation from the Austro-
Hungarian point of view, and describes the measures which Vienna has in view. A copy is now
being forwarded to Your Excellency.<br><br>

I replied to Count Szagyeny today on behalf of His Majesty that His Majesty sends his thanks to
the Emperor Francis Joseph for his letter and would soon answer it personally. In the meantime
His Majesty desires to say that he is not blind to the danger which threatens Austria-Hungary
and thus the Triple Alliance as a result of the Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation. Even
though His Majesty is known to feel no unqualified confidence in Bulgaria and her ruler, and
naturally inclines more to ward our old ally Rumania and her Hohenzollern prince, yet he quite
understands that the Emperor Francis Joseph, in view of the attitude of Rumania and of the
danger of a new Balkan alliance aimed directly at the Danube Monarchy, is anxious to bring
about an understanding between Bulgaria and the Triple alliance [...]. His Majesty will, further
more, make an effort at Bucharest, according to the wishes of the Emperor Francis Joseph, to
influence King Carol to the fulfilment of the duties of his alliance, to the renunciation of Serbia,
and to the suppression of the Rumanian agitations directed against Austria-Hungary.<br><br>

Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now
going on between Austria-Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence.
The Emperor Francis Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by
Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship.<br><br>

<b>23 July, 1914:<br>
The Austro-Hungarian Ultimatum to Serbia<br>
English Translation</b><br><br>

<i>The Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Berchtold, to the Minister at Belgrade, von
Giesl:</i><br><br>

Vienna, July 22, 1914<br><br>

Your Excellency will present the following note to the Royal Government on the afternoon of
Thursday, July 23: On the 31st of March, 1909, the Royal Serbian Minister at the Court of Vienna
made, in the name of his Government, the following declaration to the Imperial and Royal
Government:<br><br>

Serbia recognizes that her rights were not affected by the state of affairs created in Bosnia, and
states that she will accordingly accommodate herself to the decisions to be reached by the
Powers in connection with Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin. Serbia, in accepting the advice of
the Great Powers, binds herself to desist from the attitude of protest and opposition which she
has assumed with regard to the annexation since October last, and she furthermore binds
herself to alter the tendency of her present policy toward Austria-Hungary, and to live on the
footing of friendly and neighborly relations with the latter in the future.<br><br>

Now the history of the past few years, and particularly the painful events of the 28th of June,
have proved the existence of a subversive movement in Serbia, whose object it is to separate
certain portions of its territory from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. This movement, which
came into being under the very eyes of the Serbian Government, subsequently found expression
outside of the territory of the Kingdom in acts of terrorism, in a number of attempts at
assassination, and in murders.<br><br>

Far from fulfilling the formal obligations contained in its declaration of the 31st of March, 1909,
the Royal Serbian Government has done nothing to suppress this movement. It has tolerated
the criminal activities of the various unions and associations directed against the Monarchy, the
unchecked utterances of the press, the glorification of the authors of assassinations, the
participation of officers and officials in subversive intrigues; it has tolerated an unhealthy
propaganda in its public instruction; and it has tolerated, finally, every manifestation which
could betray the people of Serbia into hatred of the Monarchy and contempt for its institutions.<br><br>

This toleration of which the Royal Serbian Government was guilty, was still in evidence at that
moment when the events of the twenty-eighth of June exhibited to the whole world the
dreadful consequences of such tolerance.<br><br>

It is clear from the statements and confessions of the criminal authors of the assassination of
the twenty-eighth of June, that the murder at Sarajevo was conceived at Belgrade, that the
murderers received the weapons and the bombs with which they were equipped from Serbian
officers and officials who belonged to the Narodna Odbrana, and, finally, that the dispatch of
the criminals and of their weapons to Bosnia was arranged and effected under the conduct of
Serbian frontier authorities.<br><br>

The results brought out by the inquiry no longer permit the Imperial and Royal Government to
maintain the attitude of patient tolerance which it has observed for years toward those
agitations which center at Belgrade and are spread thence into the territories of the Monarchy.
Instead, these results impose upon the Imperial and Royal Government the obligation to put an
end to those intrigues, which constitute a standing menace to the peace of the Monarchy.<br><br>

In order to attain this end, the Imperial and Royal Government finds itself compelled to demand
that the Serbian Government give official assurance that it will condemn the propaganda
directed against Austria-Hungary, that is to say, the whole body of the efforts whose ultimate
object it is to separate from the Monarchy territories that belong to it; and that it will obligate
itself to suppress with all the means at its command this criminal and terroristic propaganda. In
order to give these assurances a character of solemnity, the Royal Serbian Government will
publish on the first page of its official organ of July 26/13, the following declaration:<br><br>

"The Royal Serbian Government condemns the propaganda directed against Austria-Hungary,
that is to say, the whole body of the efforts whose ultimate object it is to separate from the
Austro- Hungarian Monarchy territories that belong to it, and it most sincerely regrets the
dreadful consequences of these criminal transactions.<br><br>

"The Royal Serbian Government regrets that Serbian officers and officials should have taken part
in the above-mentioned propaganda and thus have endangered the friendly and neighborly
relations, to the cultivation of which the Royal Government had most solemnly pledged itself by
its declarations of March 31, 1909.<br><br>

"The Royal Government, which disapproves and repels every idea and every attempt to
interfere in the destinies of the population of whatever portion of Austria-Hungary, regards it as
its duty most expressly to call attention of the officers, officials, and the whole population of the
kingdom to the fact that for the future it will proceed with the utmost rigor against any persons
who shall become guilty of any such activities, activities to prevent and to suppress which, the
Government will bend every effort."<br><br>

This declaration shall be brought to the attention of the Royal army simultaneously by an order
of the day from His Majesty the King, and by publication in the official organ of the army.<br><br>

The Royal Serbian Government will furthermore pledge itself:<br><br>

1. to suppress every publication which shall incite to hatred and contempt of the Monarchy, and
the general tendency of which shall be directed against the territorial integrity of the latter;<br><br>

2. to proceed at once to the dissolution of the Narodna Odbrana to confiscate all of its means of
propaganda, and in the same manner to proceed against the other unions and associations in
Serbia which occupy themselves with propaganda against Austria-Hungary; the Royal
Government will take such measures as are necessary to make sure that the dissolved
associations may not continue their activities under other names or in other forms;<br><br>

3. to eliminate without delay from public instruction in Serbia, everything, whether connected
with the teaching corps or with the methods of teaching, that serves or may serve to nourish the
propaganda against Austria-Hungary;<br><br>

4. to remove from the military and administrative service in general all officers and officials who
have been guilty of carrying on the propaganda against Austria-Hungary, whose names the
Imperial and Royal Government reserves the right to make known to the Royal Government
when communicating the material evidence now in its possession;<br><br>

5. to agree to the cooperation in Serbia of the organs of the Imperial and Royal Government in
the suppression of the subversive movement directed against the integrity of the Monarchy;<br><br>

6. to institute a judicial inquiry against every participant in the conspiracy of the twenty-eighth
of June who may be found in Serbian territory; the organs of the Imperial and Royal
Government delegated for this purpose will take part in the proceedings held for this purpose;<br><br>

7. to undertake with all haste the arrest of Major Voislav Tankosic and of one Milan Ciganovitch,
a Serbian official, who have been compromised by the results of the inquiry;<br><br>

8. by efficient measures to prevent the participation of Serbian authorities in the smuggling of
weapons and explosives across the frontier; to dismiss from the service and to punish severely
those members of the Frontier Service at Schabats and Losnitza who assisted the authors of the
crime of Sarajevo to cross the frontier;<br><br>

9. to make explanations to the Imperial and Royal Government concerning the unjustifiable
utterances of high Serbian functionaries in Serbia and abroad, who, without regard for their
official position, have not hesitated to express themselves in a manner hostile toward Austria-
Hungary since the assassination of the twenty-eighth of June;<br><br>

10. to inform the Imperial and Royal Government without delay of the execution of the
measures comprised in the foregoing points.<br><br>

The Imperial and Royal Government awaits the reply of the Royal Government by Saturday, the
twenty-fifth instant, at 6 p.m., at the latest.<br><br>

A reminder of the results of the investigation about Sarajevo, to the extent they relate to the
functionaries named in points 7 and 8 [above], is appended to this note.«<br><br>

Appendix:<br><br>

«The crime investigation undertaken at court in Sarajevo against Gavrilo Princip and his
comrades on account of the assassination committed on the 28th of June this year, along with
the guilt of accomplices, has up until now led to the following conclusions:<br><br>

1. The plan of murdering Archduke Franz Ferdinand during his stay in Sarajevo was concocted in
Belgrade by Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Cabrinovic, a certain Milan Ciganovic, and Trifko Grabesch
with the assistance of Major Voija Takosic.<br><br>

2. The six bombs and four Browning pistols along with ammunition -- used as tools by the
criminals -- were procured and given to Princip, Cabrinovic and Grabesch in Belgrade by a
certain Milan Ciganovic and Major Voija Takosic.<br><br>

3. The bombs are hand grenades originating from the weapons depot of the Serbian army in
Kragujevatz.<br><br>

4. To guarantee the success of the assassination, Ciganovic instructed Princip, Cabrinovic and
Grabesch in the use of the grenades and gave lessons on shooting Browning pistols to Princip
and Grabesch in a forest next to the shooting range at Topschider.<br><br>

5. To make possible Princip, Cabrinovic und Grabesch's passage across the Bosnia-Herzegovina
border and the smuggling of their weapons, an entire secretive transportation system was
organized by Ciganovic. The entry of the criminals and their weapons into Bosnia and
Herzegovina was carried out by the main border officials of Shabatz (Rade Popovic) and Losnitza
as well as by the customs agent Budivoj Grbic of Losnitza, with the complicity of several others.«<br><br>

On the occasion of handing over this note, would Your Excellency please also add orally that -- in
the event that no unconditionally positive answer of the Royal government might be received in
the meantime -- after the course of the 48-hour deadline referred to in this note, as measured
from the day and hour of your announcing it, you are commissioned to leave the I. and R.
Embassy of Belgrade together with your personnel.<br><br>

<b>28 July 1914:<br>
The Pledge Plan</b><br><br>

<i>Telegram from the Imperial Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg, to the German Ambassador at
Vienna, Tschirschky, July 28, 1914:</i><br><br>

Telegram 174<br>
Berlin, July 28, 1914<br>
Urgent<br><br>

The Austro-Hungarian government has distinctly informed Russia that it is not considering any
territorial acquisitions in Serbia. This agrees with Your Excellency's report to the effect that
neither the Austrian nor the Hungarian statesmen consider the increase of the Slavic element in
the monarchy to be desirable. On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian government has left us
in the dark concerning its intentions, despite repeated interrogations. The reply of the Serbian
government to the Austrian ultimatum, which has now been received, makes it clear that Serbia
has agreed to the Austrian demands to so great an extent that, in case of a completely
uncompromising attitude on the part of the Austro-Hungarian government, it will become
necessary to reckon upon the gradual defection from its cause of public opinion throughout all
Europe.<br><br>

According to the statements of the Austrian General Staff, an active military movement against
Serbia will not be possible before the 12th of August. As a result, the Imperial government is
placed in the extraordinarily difficult position of being exposed in the meantime to the
mediation and conference proposals of the other cabinets and if it continues to maintain its
previous aloofness in the face of such proposals, it will incur the odium of having been
responsible for a world war, even, finally, among the German people themselves. A successful
war on three fronts cannot be commenced and carried on on any such basis.<br><br>

It is imperative that the responsibility for the eventual extension of the war among those
nations not originally immediately concerned should, under all circumstances, fall on Russia. At
Mr. Sazonoff's last conversation with Count Pourtals, the Minister already conceded that Serbia
would have to receive her "deserved lesson." At any rate the Minister was no longer so
unconditionally opposed to the Austrian point of view as he had been earlier. From this fact it is
not difficult to draw the conclusion that the Russian government might even realize that, once
the mobilization of the Austro-Hungarian Army had begun, the very honor of its arms demanded
an invasion of Serbia. But it will be all the better able to compromise with this idea if the Vienna
Cabinet repeats at Petersburg its distinct declaration that she is far from wishing to make any
territorial acquisitions in Serbia, and that her military preparations are solely for the purpose of
a temporary occupation of Belgrade and certain other localities on Serbian territory in order to
force the Serbian government to the complete fulfillment of her demands, and for the creation
of guarantees of future good behavior -- to which Austria-Hungary has an unquestionable claim
after the experiences she has had with Serbia. An occupation like the German occupation of
French territory after the Peace of Frankfort, for the purpose of securing compliance with the
demands for war indemnity, is suggested. As soon as the Austrian demands are complied with,
evacuation would follow. Should the Russian government fail to recognize the justice of this
point of view, it would have against it the public opinion of all Europe, which is now in the
process of turning away from Austria. As a further result, the general diplomatic, and probably
the military, situation would undergo material alteration in favor of Austria-Hungary and her
allies.<br><br>

Your Excellency will kindly discuss the matter along these lines thoroughly and impressively with
Count Berchtold, and instigate an appropriate move at St. Petersburg. You will have to avoid
very carefully giving rise to the impression that we wish to hold Austria back. The case is solely
one of finding a way to realize Austria's desired aim, that of cutting the vital cord of the Greater-
Serbia propaganda without at the same time bringing on a world war, and, if the latter cannot
be avoided in the end, of improving the conditions under which we shall have to wage it, insofar
as is possible.<br><br>

Sa Majesté l'Empereur<br>
Neues Palais<br><br>

Am glad you are back. In this serious moment, I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has
been declared to a weak country. The indignation in Russia shared fully by me is enormous. I
foresee that very soon I shall be overwhelmed by the pressure forced upon me and be forced to
take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such a calamity as a European
war I beg you in the name of our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going
too far.<br><br>

Nicky<br><br>

<i>Kaiser to Tsar, July 29, 1:45 A.M.</i><br>
This and the previous telegraph crossed.<br><br>

28. July 1914<br><br>

It is with the gravest concern that I hear of the impression which the action of Austria against
Serbia is creating in your country. The unscrupulous agitation that has been going on in Serbia
for years has resulted in the outrageous crime, to which Archduke Francis Ferdinand fell a victim.
The spirit that led Serbians to murder their own king and his wife still dominates the country.
You will doubtless agree with me that we both, you and me, have a common interest as well as
all Sovereigns to insist that all the persons morally responsible for the dastardly murder should
receive their deserved punishment. In this case politics plays no part at all.<br><br>

On the other hand, I fully understand how difficult it is for you and your Government to face the
drift of your public opinion. Therefore, with regard to the hearty and tender friendship which
binds us both from long ago with firm ties, I am exerting my utmost influence to induce the
Austrians to deal straightly to arrive to a satisfactory understanding with you. I confidently hope
that you will help me in my efforts to smooth over difficulties that may still arise.<br><br>

Your very sincere and devoted friend and cousin<br><br>

Willy<br><br>

<i>Kaiser to Tsar, July 29, 6:30 P.M.</i><br><br>

Berlin, 29. July 1914<br><br>

I received your telegram and share your wish that peace should be maintained. But as I told you
in my first telegram, I cannot consider Austria's action against Servia an "ignoble" war. Austria
knows by experience that Servian promises ono paper are wholly unreliable. I understand its
action must be judged as trending to get full guarantee that the Servian promises shall become
real facts. This my reasoning is borne out by the statement of the Austrian cabinet that Austria
does not want to make any territorial conquests at the expense of Servia. I therefore suggest
that it would be quite possible for Russia to remain a spectator of the austro-servian conflict
without involving Europe in the most horrible war she ever witnessed. I think a direct
understanding between your Government and Vienna possible and desirable, and as I already
telegraphed to you, my Government is continuing its exercises to promote it. Of course military
measures on the part of Russia would be looked upon by Austria as a calamity we both wish to
avoid and jeopardize my position as mediator which I readily accepted on your appeal to my
friendship and my help.<br><br>

Willy<br><br>

<i>Tsar to Kaiser, July 29, 8:20 P.M.</i><br><br>

Peter's Court Palace, 29 July 1914<br><br>

Thanks for your telegram conciliatory and friendly. Whereas official message presented today by
your ambassador to my minister was conveyed in a very different tone. Beg you to explain this
divergency! It would be right to give over the Austro-servian problem to the Hague conference.
Trust in your wisdom and friendship.<br><br>

Your loving Nicky<br><br>

<i>Tsar to Kaiser, July 30, 1:20 A.M.</i><br><br>

Peter's Court Palais, 30 July 1914<br><br>

Thank you heartily for your quick answer. Am sending Tatischev this evening with instructions.
The military measures which have now come into force were decided five days ago for reasons
of defence on account of Austria's preparations. I hope from all my heart that these measures
won't in any way interfere with your part as mediator which I greatly value. We need your
strong pressure on Austria to come to an understanding with us.<br><br>

Nicky<br><br>

<i>Kaiser to Tsar, July 30, 1:20 A.M.</i><br><br>

Berlin, 30. July 1914<br><br>

Best thanks for telegram. It is quite out of the question that my ambassadors language could
have been in contradiction with the tenor of my telegram. Count Pourtalès was instructed to
draw the attention of your government to the danger & grave consequences involved by a
mobilisation; I said the same in my telegram to you. Austria has only mobilised against Servia &
only a part of her army. If, as it is now the case, according to the communication by you & your
Government, Russia mobilises against Austria, my rôle as mediator you kindly intrusted me with,
& which I accepted at you[r] express prayer, will be endangered if not ruined. The whole weight
of the decision lies solely on you[r] shoulders now, who have to bear the responsibility for Peace
or War.<br><br>

Willy<br><br>

<i>Kaiser to Tsar, July 31</i><br><br>

Berlin, 31. July 1914<br><br>

On your appeal to my friendship and your call for assistance began to mediate between your
and the austro-hungarian Government. While this action was proceeding your troops were
mobilised against Austro-Hungary, my ally. thereby, as I have already pointed out to you, my
mediation has been made almost illusory.<br><br>

I have nevertheless continued my action. I now receive authentic news of serious preparations
for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility for the safety of my empire forces preventive
measures of defence upon me. In my endeavours to maintain the peace of the world I have
gone to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster which is now threatening
the whole civilized world will not be laid at my door. In this moment it still lies in your power to
avert it. Nobody is threatening the honour or power of Russia who can well afford to await the
result of my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me by my
grandfather on his deathbed has always been sacred to me and I have honestly often backed up
Russia when she was in serious trouble especially in her last war.<br><br>

The peace of Europe may still be maintained by you, if Russia will agree to stop the milit.
measures which must threaten Germany and Austro-Hungary.<br><br>

Willy<br><br>

<i>Tsar to Kaiser, July 31<br>
This and the previous telegram crossed.</i><br><br>

Petersburg, Palace, 31 July 1914<br><br>

Sa Majesté l'Empereur, Neues Palais<br><br>

I thank you heartily for your mediation which begins to give one hope that all may yet end
peacefully. It is technically impossible to stop our military preparations which were obligatory
owing to Austria's mobilisation. We are far from wishing war. As long as the negociations with
Austria on Servia's account are taking place my troops shall not make any provocative action. I
give you my solemn word for this. I put all my trust in Gods mercy and hope in your successful

Sa Majesté l'Empereur<br>
Berlin<br><br>

I received your telegram. Understand you are obliged to mobilise but wish to have the same
guarantee from you as I gave you, that these measures do not mean war and that we shall
continue negociating for the benefit of our countries and universal peace deal to all our hearts.
Our long proved friendship must succeed, with God's help, in avoiding bloodshed. Anexiously,
full of confidence await your answer.<br><br>

Nicky<br><br>

<i>Kaiser to Tsar, August 1</i><br><br>

Berlin, 1. August 1914<br><br>

Thanks for your telegram. I yesterday pointed out to your government the way by which alone
war may be avoided. Although I requested an answer for noon today, no telegram from my
ambassador conveying an answer from your Government has reached me as yet. I therefore
have been obliged to mobilise my army.<br><br>

Immediate affirmative clear and unmistakable answer from your government is the only way to
avoid endless misery. Until I have received this answer alas, I am unable to discuss the subject of
your telegram. As a matter of fact I must request you to immediatly [sic] order your troops on
no account to commit the slightest act of trespassing over our frontiers.<br><br>

<b>4 August, 1914<br>
President Poincaré's War Message</b><br><br>

<i>Address to Parliament.<br>
From the French Yellow Book Journal Officiel, Paris, August 5, 1914.</i><br><br>

GENTLEMEN:<br><br>

France has just been the object of a violent and premeditated attack, which is an insolent
defiance of the law of nations. Before any declaration of war had been sent to us, even before
the German Ambassador had asked for his passports, our territory has been violated. The
German Empire has waited till yesterday evening to give at this late stage the true name to a
state of things which it had already created.<br><br>

For more than forty years the French, in sincere love of peace, have buried at the bottom of
their heart the desire for legitimate reparation.<br><br>

They have given to the world the example of a great nation which, definitely raised from defeat
by the exercise of will, patience, and labour, has only used its renewed and rejuvenated strength
in the interest of progress and for the good of humanity.<br><br>

Since the ultimatum of Austria opened a crisis which threatened the whole of Europe, France
has persisted in following and in recommending on all sides a policy of prudence, wisdom, and
moderation.<br><br>

To her there can be imputed no act, no movement, no word, which has not been peaceful and
conciliatory.<br><br>

At the hour when the struggle is beginning, she has the right, in justice to herself, of solemnly
declaring that she has made, up to the last moment, supreme efforts to avert the war now
about to break out, the crushing responsibility for which the German Empire will have to bear
before history. (<i>Unanimous and repeated applause</i>.) . . . Our fine and courageous army, which
France today accompanies with her maternal thought (<i>loud applause</i>) has risen eager to defend
the honour of the flag and the soil of the country. (<i>Unanimous and repeated applause</i>.)<br><br>

The President of the Republic interpreting the unanimous feeling of the country, expresses to
our troops by land and sea the admiration and confidence of every Frenchman (<i>loud and
prolonged applause</i>).<br><br>

Closely united in a common feeling, the nation will persevere with the cool self-restraint of
which, since the beginning of the crisis, she has given daily proof. Now, as always, she will know
how to harmonise the most noble daring and most ardent enthusi asm with that self-control
which is the sign of enduring energy and is the best guarantee of victory (<i>applause</i>).<br><br>

In the war which is beginning, France will have Right on her side, the eternal power of which
cannot with impunity be disregarded by nations any more than by individuals (<i>loud and
unanimous applause</i>).<br><br>

She will be heroically defended by all her sons; nothing will break their sacred union before the
enemy; today they are joined together as brothers in a common indignation against the
aggressor, and in a common patriotic faith (<i>loud and prolonged applause and cries of 'Vive la
France'</i>).<br><br>

She is faithfully helped by Russia, her ally (<i>loud and unanimous applause</i>); she is supported by
the loyal friendship of Great Britain (<i>loud and unanimous applause</i>).<br><br>

And already from every part of the civilised world sympathy and good wishes are coming to her.
For today once again she stands before the universe for Liberty, Justice, and Reason (<i>loud and
repeated applause</i>)<br><br>

'Haut les coeurs et vive la France!' (<i>unanimous and prolonged applause</i>).
