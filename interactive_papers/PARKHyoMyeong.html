Certain Victory Images of World War II in the Japanese Media
</p>

<p>
(page 46) 13 and 14. (left) <i>Asahigraph</i> (13;25), 21 December 1938, back cover. This Art Deco Brazil Coffee advertisement with its image of skiers would not have been out of place in any upscale American or European magazine of this time. The sophisticated leisure touted here was doomed by mobilization of the home front for the China war. Coffer could hardly be had at any price after 1941, and no one would wear the posh sweater with large “B” on it once the “ABCE” (American, British, Chinese and Dutch) powers became the enemy. (right) <i> Asahigaph</i> (13:26), 28 December, p. 34. A page of advertisements for luxury goods reflecting materialism, one of the ecils emanating from the West; cameras electric clocks, neckties and cosmetics, All of these products (except the German-made Voigatlander cameras retailing at the astronomical price of 140 yen and 165 yen) were made in Japan for the Japanese market. Advertisements like these were never carried in PWR and would almost entirely disappear from <i>Asahigragh</i> after 1941. Items such as cameras would vanish from shop shelves during the Pacific War. 
</p>

<p>
(page 48) 16-17. PWR 41, 23 November 1938. 
(top) “Civilizing the Savage Tribe” of Taiwan’s mountainous interior the extreme-angle cover photograph accentuates rugged facial features and makes the spear (a symbol of savagery) look longer and sharper. The contrast between Taiwan, receiver of the civilization, and Japan, bestower, was a measure of Japan’s greatness.
</p>

<p>
(page 84) 29. <i> Asashigraph </i> (29:26) <i> China Battle Front Photograph </i> 23, 29 December 1937. “Fall of Nanjing.” Japanese troops 150 feet in front of Zhonghua Gate, Nanjing, on 12 December 1937.
</p>
<p>
(page 113) 10 and 11. <i> PWR </i> 24, 7 July 1938. (bottom, p. 12) On Army Day, citizens and soldiers bent and flexed in unison to the beat of the same music printed beneath the photograph.
</p>

<p>
(page 114) 12 <i> PWR </i> 14, 8 May 1938, p. j10 One photograph from an article. “The Police Protect the Imperial Capital during the China Incident,” shows a policeman fitting a Tokyo family with gas masks. 
</p>

<p>
(page 120) 26 <i> PWR </i> 184, 3 September 1941, pp. 2-3. This two-page poster-size message uses the voices of fallen soldiers to coerce the home front to do their part for the air defense: “A bomb is only a bomb in the moment in explodes. After that, it is only a fire. And you wouldn’t run away without trying to put out a mere fire, would you? You encouraged the brave warrior who were drafted, telling them to ‘do your best job for us, so that your death serves the nation.’ And now that the situation has grown serious, it is your turn to guard the city. The souls of fallen heroes are waiting for you to join the fight.” Illustration: Suzuki Gyosui
</p>

<p> 
(page 162) 36 and 17. (left) <i> PWR </i> 151, 15 January 1941. Morale-boosting with battledores, New Year’s 1941. This New Year’s issue features three beauties – a Japanese woman in the center flanked by a German and Italian – representing the Axis of powers, each holding a battledore with an Axis leader on it: Konoe, Mussolini and Hitler. Having the Japanese woman holding Mussolini, the Italian holding Hitler, and German holding Konoe, visually reinforced the image’s message of solidarity. Representations of Hitler and Mussolini were uncommon in the Japanese wartime press.
</p>

<p>
(page 276) 42-44. (top left) <i> National Language (Kokugo) </i>, a Japanese phrasebook published in Keijo (Seoul) in 1942. The language level was very basic, the emphasis on patriotism pronounced. On the first page (picture here), the phrases are “Worship from Afar of Japanese Imperial Palace” (with a photograph of the Double Bridge) and “Patriotic Group,” “Council,” and “Rising Sun Flag.”
(top right) The “Katakana Society” produced a series of Japanese language books in the late 1930s and early 1940s for distribution among Chinese, Korean, Southeast Asian. This typical page includes greetings and phrases about coming and going. The illustration reveal as much about communication as the text, as a (presumably non-Japanese) boy shows a proper deference toward a Japanese soldier.
</p>
<p>
71. <i> PWR 272, 19 May 1942, p. 2. “Sign-board of the Times” 
(page 286) The footprints of such vigorous development have already been demonstrated before the watching eyes of the people of the world in the form of the ardent sincere cooperation of Burma and the Philippines, as well as the resources being developed in Malaya, Shonan, Borneo, and Java, and the heartfelt respect of the residents there, That’s right, the Southern Regions continue to grow rapidly. With our great pride as the leader, Japan, let us become their sun and gentle rain.”
</p>

<p>
(page 315) 14 and 15. <i> PWR 262, 10 March 1943. (left, p. 12) A full-page cartoon for children to color by Yokoyama Ryuichi (1901-2001)… (right, p.13) Another cartoon for children to color by Ishikawa Shinsuke(1906-1995)
</P>

<p>
(page 324) 17-30. Four front convers of <i> Chuo Koron </i> display subtle clues to the magazine’s problems with the censor.
</p>

<p>
(page 375) 1. <i> PWR </i> 327, 28 June 1944. The “Signbord of the Times” says (vertically from right to lest): “For us, only the wait was unbearable, but finally the day has come – ATTACK, JUST ATTACK.”
</p>

<p>
(page 409) 1. <i> PWR </i> 353, 3 January 194. The “Signboard of the Times” on the front cover of the New Year’s issue carries the message, “In this new year, although the fierceness of the battle intensifies, our will to fight is unyielding. We One Hundred Million are already kamikazefied. The people in this Land of Gods renew their will to fight.
</p>

<p>
(page 415) 5. <i> History Pictures </i> 375, February 1943, p.12. “Recently donated to the Navy Hall, this Honma Shugaku;s portrait of the nine warrior-gods who, at the beginning of the Great East Asia War, penetrated the important base of the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, sinking enemy warships as their lives scattered like the petals of nation-protecting flowers.”
</p>

<p> 
(page 425) 24-27. <i> PWR </i> 243, 21 October 1942, pp 4-5. “On 31 May, the Special Attack Forces made a daring moonlight raid, slipping through the heavy dragnet in Jackson Bay outside of Sydney Bay, and scored a great blow to the enemy by sinking one enemy ship moored there.” (right page, top) “The remains of the Four Pillars are solemnly carried from the ship- repatriating them.” (right page, bottom) “Some of the relatives who have come to receive the remains and tell them ‘you really did well.’” (left page, top) “The remains, borne by family members and old friends, proceed silently past the Marine Youth Corps, who salute the remains with the dipped funerary flags.” (left page, bottom) “Is there anyone, among we one hundred mllion citizens, who would not weep before the spirit of incomparable loyalty of the four fallen warriors?”
