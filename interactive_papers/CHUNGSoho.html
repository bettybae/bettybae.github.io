	case 1: $("div#commentary").html('Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (1922 - 2007) was an American novelist and essayist renown for his satirical literary style and is critically acclaimed to be among the most influential American novelists of the 20th century. <sup>1</sup> Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and attended Cornell University as Chemistry major. However, being interested in journalism Vonnegut became the managing editor of The Cornell Daily Sun. He enrolled in the US army and was captured by the German troops more or less instantly after his dispatch to Europe. <sup>2</sup> Vonnegut was sent to Dresden as an American POW and survived the bombing of Dresden by being in an underground slaughterhouse meat locker that the Germans referred to as Schlachthof Fünf (“Slaughterhouse Five”). <sup>3</sup> “On February 13, 1945, British and American bombers destroyed the city by dropping high explosives followed by incendiary bombs. The resulting firestorm turned the non-militarized city into an inferno that killed up to 60,000 civilians.” <sup>4</sup> Vonnegut writes, “The night they came over, we spent in an underground meat locker in a slaughterhouse. We were lucky, for it was the best shelter in town. Giants stalked the earth above us. First came the first murmur of their dancing on the outskirts, then the grumbling of their plodding toward us, and finally the ear-splitting crashes of their heels upon us--and thence to the outskirts again. Back and forth they swept: saturation bombing.” <br><br>He was liberated by the Russian Red Army soldiers in May 1945 and was rewarded a Purple Heart upon his return to America. This experience was Vonnegut’s inspiration for his novel, Slaughterhouse-Five.<sup>5</sup> Kurt was identified with his peculiar writing style which comprised of lengthy sentences and minimal use of punctuation marks. Even though Vonnegut was successful in establishing himself as a literary figure, he struggled with chronic depression and attempted suicide in 1984. <sup>6</sup> Vonnegut mentions in Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage that “Being present at the Dresden has affected my character far less than the death of my mother, the adopting of my sister’s children, the sudden realization that those children and my own were no longer dependent on me, the breakup of my marriage, and on and on.” <sup>7</sup><br><br><br>1 “<a href="http://www.biography.com/people/kurt-vonnegut-9520329#awesm=~oEdpYRmtjQwssI">Kurt Vonnegut Biography</a>” (accessed on May 12, 2014).<br><br>2 William Rodney Allen, “A Brief Biography of Kurt Vonnegut,” <a href="http://www.vonnegutlibrary.org/about/">Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library</a>, (accessed on May 12, 2014) <br><br>3 Kurt Vonnegut, <i>Armageddon in Retrospect</i> (New York: G.P.

This does not influence the controversy about whether the bombing was necessary. But it indicates that it caused far fewer deaths than the 1943 bombing of Hamburg or the 1945 Tokyo firestorm.” (589)<br><br>“In January alone, 450,000 Germans died; in each of the ensuing three months, more than 280,000, a figure that included victims of the Anglo-American bombings of Dresden, Leipzig and other eastern cities. During the final four months of the war, more Germans perished than in the whole of 1942-43. Such numbers emphasize the price paid by the German people for their army leadership’s failure to depose the Nazis and quit the war before its last terrible act.” (594)<br><br>“In Germany’s cities, half the housing stock had been destroyed, including 3.8 million of 19 million apartments. Richard Johnston of the New York Times wrote from the ruins of Nuremberg: "Like timid ground creatures, a few Germans came up from their shelters, caves and cellars this morning to blink in strong sunlight and stare unbelieving at the awful mess that was their town ... Nuremberg is a city of the dead." Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg were worse. The Thirty Years’ War, three centuries earlier, had inflicted greater proportionate loss on Germany’s population, but the physical devastation of 1945 was unparalleled in history: Europe’s great cities had been spared by the First World War, and even from the rampages of Napoleon.” (631, from Johnston, <i>New York Times</i>, 22 April 1945)'); break;

	<p>
	The trip to Dresden was a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">lark.</a> It took only two hours. Shriveled little bellies were full. Sunlight and mild air came in through the ventilators. There were plenty of smokes from the Englishmen.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon: The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd. It looked like a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Sunday school picture of Heaven</a> to Billy Pilgrim.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Somebody behind him in the boxcar said, "Oz." That was I. That was me. The only other city I'd ever seen was Indianapolis, Indiana.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Every other big city in Germany had been bombed and burned ferociously. Dresden had not suffered so much as a cracked windowpane. Sirens went off every day, screamed like hell, and people went down into cellars and listened to radios there. The planes were always bound for someplace else-Leipzig, Chemnitz, Plauen, places like that. So it goes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Steam radiators still whistled cheerily in Dresden. Streetcars clanged. Telephones rang and were answered. Lights went on and off when switches were clicked. There were theaters and restaurants. There was a zoo. The principal enterprises of the city were medicine and food- processing and the making of cigarettes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	People were going home from work now in the late afternoon. They were tired.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Eight Dresdeners crossed the steel spaghetti of the railroad yard. They were wearing new uniforms. They had been sworn into the army the day before. They were boys and men past middle age, and two veterans who had been shot to pieces in Russia. Their assignment was to guard one hundred American prisoners of war, who would work as contract labor. A grandfather and his grandson were in the squad. The grandfather was an architect.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The eight were grim as they approached the boxcars containing their wards. They knew what sick and foolish soldiers they themselves appeared to be. One of them actually had an artificial leg, and carried not only a loaded rifle but a cane. Still-they were expected to earn obedience and respect from tall, cocky, murderous American infantrymen who had just come from all the killing at the front.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And then they saw bearded Billy Pilgrim in his blue toga and silver shoes, with his hands in a muff. He looked at least sixty years old. Next to Billy was little Paul Lazzaro with a broken arm. He was fizzing with rabies. Next to Lazzaro was the poor old high school teacher, Edgar Derby, mournfully pregnant with patriotism and middle age and imaginary wisdom. And <i>so</i> on.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The eight ridiculous Dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures really <i>were</i> American fighting men fresh from the front. They smiled, and then they laughed. Their terror evaporated. There was nothing to be afraid of. Here were more crippled human beings, more fools like themselves. Here was light opera.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So out of the gate of the railroad yard and into the streets of Dresden marched the light opera. Billy Pilgrim was the star. He led the parade. Thousands of people were on the sidewalks, going home from work. They were watery and putty-colored, having eaten mostly' potatoes during the past two years. They had expected no blessings beyond the mildness of the day. Suddenly--- here was fun.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Billy did not meet many of the eyes that found him so entertaining. He was enchanted by the architecture of the city. Merry amoretti wove garlands above windows. Roguish fauns and naked nymphs peeked down at Billy from festooned cornices. Stone monkeys frisked among scrolls and seashells and bamboo.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Billy, with his memories of the future, knew that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">the city would be smashed to smithereens and then burned</a>- in about thirty more days. He knew, too, that most of the people watching him would soon be dead. So it goes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His finger- tips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario's coat were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There at the corner, in the front rank of pedestrians, was a surgeon who had been operating all day. He was a civilian, but his posture was military. He had served in two world wars. The sight of Billy offended him, especially after he learned from the guards that Billy was an American. It seemed to him that Billy was in abominable taste, supposed that Billy had gone to a lot of silly trouble to costume himself just so.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The surgeon spoke English, and he said to Billy, "I take it you find war a very comical thing."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Billy looked at him vaguely. Billy had lost track momentarily of where he was or how he had gotten there. He had no idea that people thought he was clowning. It was Fate, of course, which had costumed him---Fate, and a feeble will to survive.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Did you expect us to <i>laugh</i>?" the surgeon asked him.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The surgeon was demanding some sort of satisfaction. Billy was mystified. Billy wanted to be friendly, to help, if he could, but his resources were meager. His fingers now held the two objects from the lining of the coat. Billy decided to show the surgeon what they were.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"You thought we would enjoy being <i>mocked</i>?" the surgeon said. "And do you feel <i>proud</i> to represent America as you do?''
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Billy withdrew a hand from his muff, held it under the surgeon's nose. On his palm rested a two-carat diamond and a partial denture. The denture was an obscene little artifact---silver and pearl and tangerine. Billy smiled.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The parade pranced, staggered and reeled to the gate of the Dresden slaughterhouse, and then it went inside. The slaughterhouse wasn't a busy place any more. Almost all the hooved animals in Germany had been killed and eaten and excreted by human beings, mostly soldiers. So it goes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Americans were taken to the fifth building inside the gate. It was a one-story cement-block cube with sliding doors in front and back. It had been built as a shelter for pigs about to be butchered. Now it was going to serve as a home away from home for one hundred American prisoners of war. There were bunks in there, and two potbellied stoves and a water tap. Behind it was a latrine, which was a one-rail fence with buckets under it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There was a big number over the door of the building. The number was <i>five</i>. Before the Americans could go inside, their only English-speaking guard told them to memorize their simple address, in case they got lost in the big city. Their address was this: "Schlachthof-fünf." <i>Schlachthof</i> meant <i>slaughterhouse</i>. <i>Fünf</i> was good old <i>five</i>.
