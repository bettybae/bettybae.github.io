	<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>
	<b>Background and context </b><br><br>

	(1) This book seeks to introduce the reader to an important and highly controversial period of French history: world war and occupation.<br>
	(2) It may be helpful here to sketch out the main contours of the period under consideration.<br>
	(3) For the first two years or so, the Vichy administration had some autonomy, but after 1942 and the German invasion of the southern zone all this changed and the occupiers were, effectively, in control of the whole country.<br>
	(4) At the same time, a myriad of groups—both inside and outside France—were forming and evolving with the explicit aim of resisting the German presence in France and opposing the Vichy regime.<br>
	(5) Ultimately, these forces, in tandem with the Allied powers, were able to help extricate France from the despair and shame of the Occupation.<br>
	(6) This, however, began to change in the 1970s.<br>
	(7) To comprehend the wartime period, however, one must first appreciate the climactic nature of the Fall of France—described variously as a ‘debacle’, a ‘disaster’ and a ‘catastrophe’.<br>
	(8) It is extremely difficult to analyse the Fall of France in 1940 without making reference to the political and economic tribulations of the previous decades, and so an understanding of the inter-war years is crucial to an overall analysis of 1940.<br>
	(9) The Great Depression and the Crash of 1929, together with fascist riots in 1934 and the emergence of the Popular Front in 1936, helped to create a weak and divided France—a France torn by left-right tension and prone to extremism on both flanks of the political spectrum.<br>
	(10) This, of course, was most obvious on the military plane.<br>
	(11) It is easy to detect a definite arrogance in the stance taken by the French authorities.<br>
	(12) It could also be argued, quite strongly, that France’s foreign policy in the period 1919–39 was weak and incoherent.<br>
	(13) It is also undeniable that inter-war France was beset by terrible political feuding and in-fighting.<br>
	(14) Another view is that national economic decline prepared the way for military defeat, even if it did not directly cause it.<br>
	(15) This book will explore, and synthesise, the main secondary writings on the Occupation period; in certain places too, the spotlight will shift to key primary sources.<br>
	(16) In the following two chapters the ‘high’ politics of the period will be explored.<br>
	(17) In Chapter 4, the focus will shift to the Liberation.<br>
	<br>
	<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br>
	<b>Occupation</b><br><br>
	<b>French and Germans</b><br><br>
	(1) The Occupation of France was heralded by Article 1 of the Franco-German Armistice, signed in June 1940.<br>
	(2) By 1942 Germany had moved into the southern zone.<br> 
	(3) However, it would be a mistake to view the Occupation, solely, as a crude Nazi strategy — as, if you like, ‘France under the swastika’.<br>
	(4) In the next chapter we will examine the Vichy regime and the policy of collaboration, and in Chapter 3 we will explore the reality of the Resistance, in all its diversity and plurality.<br>
	(5) So, in this chapter the nature and everyday reality of the Occupation and the social and economic effects of the German invasion will be considered.<br><br>
	<b>Beginnings</b><br><br>
	(6) How and why did Nazi Germany commence its Occupation?<br>
	(7) It is clear, first, that the Occupation was a strategic measure.<br>
	(8) In those regions of France occupied by the Germans, the Reich is to exercise all the rights of an occupying power.<br>
	(9) Consequently, the French Government is immediately to notify the authorities and public services of the occupied territories that they will have to conform to the decisions of the German military commanders and to collaborate faithfully with them.<br>
	(10) The Armistice was not particularly specific about what the day-to-day reality of the Occupation would be.<br>
	(11) This is most vividly illustrated in Article 18: ‘The cost of maintaining German troops in French territory falls on the French Government.<br>
	(12) There were thus obligations — and also restrictions.<br><br>
	<b>Reality</b><br><br>
	(13) The reality of the post-Armistice situation was symbolised by the ‘line of demarcation’ which separated occupied France in the north from unoccupied France in the south.<br>
	(14) There are other important questions: What did the Occupation mean in practical terms?<br> 
	(15) Kedward paints an extremely vivid picture of the Occupation’s initial impact:<br>
	(16) Most obviously, the Occupation had severe economic effects.<br>
	(17) France was exploited mercilessly for the good of the German war effort.<br>
	(18) Food was a particularly crucial issue.<br>
	(19) On another level there was the <i>service du travail obligatoire</i> (STO): a scheme which obliged France to send nationals to Germany to work for the Nazi regime.<br>
	(20) In social terms, the Occupation had a wide array of ramifications.<br>
	(21) The dislocation implicit in war and the Occupation also had a range of significant demographic effects.<br>
	(22) In the sphere of communications the German presence was extremely evident.<br>
	(23) Likewise the German presence had not insignificant consequences for leisure.<br>
	(24) The Occupation was also a period of massive, and profound, artistic creation.<br>
	(25) In addition, the Germans made significant efforts to promote themselves and their country.<br>
	(26) Politically, the occupied zone was a strange mix.<br>
	(27) We started this section by making reference to the ‘line of demarcation’ which split the northern zone from the southern zone and which inevitably came to symbolise national division.<br><br>
	<b>The German presence</b><br><br>
	(28) Underlying all of this was the presence of the Germans.<br>
	(29) The presence of the Gestapo had its effect.<br>
	(30) The Gestapo attempted to regulate the life of the occupied zone.<br>
	(31) Throughout the Occupation period, the Franco-German dynamic was fascinating to observe.<br>
	(32) For its part, France had a somewhat schizophrenic view of Germany and Germans.<br>
	(33) Of course, de Beauvoir hated the whole notion of the Occupation — calling it at one point, ‘absolutely hellish’ — but she begins to admire the Germans’ kindness, politeness and general decency.<br>
	(34) More than anything, the Germans’ presence had consequences for the northern zone’s Jewish population.<br>
	(35) The Occupation was, therefore, a terrible ordeal.<br><br>
	<b>Division</b><br><br>
	(36) The main legacy of the Occupation was division.<br>
	(37) The traditional urban-rural friction — always on display, even at the best of times — had a similar kind of tone: the urban areas felt that the countryside was starving the cities.<br>
	(38) In summing up, it is helpful to refer to a cartoon of a café scene in a wartime French newspaper.<br>
	<br><br>
	<b>CHAPTER TWO</b><br><br>
	<b>Vichy and collaboration</b><br><br>
	<b>From the National Revolution to Hitler’s revolution</b><br><br>
	(1) Vichy is a tranquil, pleasant and unsuspecting town.<br>
	(2) The reality of the situation is that between 1940 and 1944, the humble and picturesque town of Vichy was home to conservatives, traditionalists, anti-semites, and even the odd heart-and-soul fascist.<br>
	(3) This chapter will consider the general political climate at Vichy and the main contours of government; it will then move on to assess the two ultra-controversial <i>Pétainiste</i> initiatives of 1940 — the National Revolution and collaboration; and finally it will offer a series of perspectives on the question of how we should interpret the Vichy era as a whole.<br>
	(4) On 16 June 1940 Paul Reynaud resigned as premier and was succeeded by Pétain.<br>
	(5) The pace of life at Vichy was slow, relaxed and leisurely — a far cry from the trauma, emotion and devastation of world war.<br>
	(6) The key relationship was that between Vichy and Berlin.<br><br>
	<b>The National Revolution</b><br><br>
	(7) The key development in the early years of Vichy was the National Revolution.<br>
	(8) The National Revolution emerges, in general terms, as an exercise in nostalgia.<br>
	(9) In an era of German occupation, German tutelage and German exploitation, there was in fact something peculiarly French about the National Revolution.<br>
	(10) The National Revolution was also an innately ‘French’ scheme in the sense that it was the project of those people in the Vichy administration who stood furthest away from the Germans and who wanted to lift the spirits of France by returning to the essence of French society and French history.<br>
	(11) Although historians constantly use the phrase National <i>Revolution</i>, Pétain tended to prefer the term National <i>Restoration</i>.<br>
	(12) On economic matters — in the early days at least — Vichy was ultra-conservative.<br> 
	(13) In this spirit, Vichy offered special aid packages to small family farms.<br>
	(14) Vichy was a regime of contrasts.<br>
	(15) Initially, therefore, there was a myriad of influences at Vichy — ‘reactionary, monarchist, corporatist, clerical’ — but in the end it was the ‘modernists’ who took sway and the government, whatever Pétain’s personal prejudices, began to embrace state planning and technology (the inception of a 10-year plan being a prime example of this policy in action).<br>
	(16) It could also be argued that there was a progressive dimension to Vichy rule in the realm of social affairs and welfare.<br> 
	(17) In power, Pétain prioritised the birth-rate issue and sent a clear message out to the effect that a woman’s place was in the home.<br>
	(18) More generally, Pétain glorified the family.<br>
	(19) There were other planks to Vichy’s moral crusade.<br>
	(20) The administration was eager to ‘clean up’ what it viewed as a decadent and corrupt education system and thus determined to help foster a more ‘patriotic’ climate in schools.<br>
	(21) In all of its strictures on the family, morality and demography, Vichy knew that it was also tapping into Catholic and Christian teaching.<br>
	(22) Throughout its policy pronouncements and preaching on morality, there was one underlying theme: the belief that Vichy incarnated some higher kind of patriotism.<br>
	(23) Although in one sense Pétain’s patriotic credentials <i>were</i> unquestionable — the ‘Victor of Verdun’ was France’s greatest living soldier — in another, perhaps more important way, it was difficult to comprehend how a man who had agreed to collaborate with Hitler could continue to play the ‘patriotic’ card.<br>
	(24) On the whole, it is difficult to gauge the popularity of the National Revolution with ordinary people living in the southern zone.<br>
	(25) There were also the inevitable tensions: on the level of ideas between traditionalists and modernists, on the level of personalities between Pétain and Laval, and on the level of governance between Berlin and Vichy.<br><br>
	<b>Collaboration</b><br><br>
	(26) If the National Revolution was, in essence, about France returning to its roots and rediscovering its Frenchness, collaboration was, in fundamental terms, about the Vichy regime and ordinary French people kowtowing to a foreign power.<br>
	(27) Collaboration came in many forms: liaisons in the black market, personal friendships and, most notorious of all, ‘<i>collaboration horizontale</i>’.<br>
	(28) While it is interesting to debate the ethics and morality of collaboration, it is probably more important to assess how and why it actually took place.<br>
	(29) At its most stark, collaboration was a desperate and unavoidable reaction to defeat and collapse in 1940.<br>
	(30) Laval’s attitude was different, and on the surface far less ‘principled’.<br>
	(31) Beyond the issue of personalities, there was a longstanding belief in France — evident especially in the 1930s — that an alliance with the diplomatic powers of central Europe was an inevitable, and also desirable, arrangement.<br>
	(32) On the French side, there were other factors encouraging the search for an accommodation with Germany: the desire, or need, to impress the Germans in an effort to water down the main terms of the Armistice and the genuine belief that the Vichy regime and Hitler stood for similar values — the notion, in effect, that collaboration was an ideological understanding.<br>
	(33) If the National Revolution was predominantly the project of Pétain, collaboration was — with the acquiescence of the Marshal — the issue on which Laval acquired his main notoriety.<br>
	(34) On a social level, collaboration was unavoidable.<br><br>
	<b>Vichy and the Jews</b><br><br>
	(35) The most notorious aspect of the wartime period was Vichy’s attitude, and policy, towards the Jews.<br>
	(36) Institutional anti-semitism in France during the wartime period was a mix of Vichy laws and German ordinances (for good measure the occupiers monitored and examined all ‘French’ legislation).<br>
	(37) It is vital to comprehend the scale of Vichy’s anti-semitic crusade.<br>
	(38) The debate which has preoccupied historians has been a simple and important one: What factors, in reality, explain Vichy’s anti-semitic policy?<br>
	(39) As regards Vichy’s involvement in the Holocaust, an obvious line of thinking is that which emphasises the indigenous nature of antisemitism in France.<br>
	(40) Alternatively, it could be postulated that it was the Catholic tradition in France, rather than the lineage of anti-semitic ideas, that had a significant impact on Pétain.<br>
	(41) In a similar vein, it is crucial to acknowledge the influence of the Action Française on the Vichy leader.<br>
	(42) It could be argued that Vichy’s anti-semitism was in some way aimed at ‘impressing’ Berlin.<br>
	(43) These of course are all legitimate lines of argument; each perspective has its own merit and validity and each merges and overlaps with others.<br>
	(44) It is difficult though to account for Vichy’s anti-semitic policy without acknowledging the pivotal role played by Laval.<br><br>
	<b>Collaborationism</b><br><br>
	(45) The other highly distinctive form of collaboration was that which traded in ideas: collaborationism.<br>
	(46) What we are dealing with here is a group of hardcore collaborators — The Ideologists’: people like Jacques Doriot, Marcel Déat, Robert Brasillach, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Alphonse de Châteaubriant, Lucien Rebatet, Fernand de Brinon, Jean Luchaire and Joseph Darnand.<br>
	(47) The Parisian collaborationists had very little in common with Pétain and Pétainism.<br>
	(48) The conclusion must be that collaboration — if defined in its broadest sense — was always going to be inevitable once France had collapsed and had been occupied.<br>
	(49) The defeat in 1940 had profound implications: on the one hand, the ultra-traditional crusade that was the National Revolution; on the other, the <i>realpolitik</i> of collaboration.<br>
	(50) Lest we forget, Vichy, for most of the wartime period, had little real independence.<br>
	<br><br>
	<b>CHAPTER THREE</b><br><br>
	<b>Resistance</b><br><br>
	<i>Internal and external</i><br><br>
	(1) The Resistance’, as a phrase, is a misnomer.<br>
	(2) At root there is one basic question: What actually counted as an act of resistance? The truth is that every resister had his or her own particular way of resisting.<br><br>
	<b>What was the French Resistance?</b><br><br>
	(3) There are two key issues.<br>
	(4) What was the Resistance? Important clues to its identity may be found in the things that provoked people into resistance: patriotism, morality, instinct, revenge, the onward march of the German war machine.<br>
	(5) It could also be argued that ‘community’, or rather ‘sense of community’, was a vitally important part of the Resistance value-system.<br>
	(6) The ‘ideology’ of the Resistance—where it is possible to identify one at all—was only loose and fragmentary.<br>
	(7) The Resistance was, in addition, about justice.<br>
	(8) So, ‘complex, confused, under-explored and unexplorable’, the Resistance is an intriguing phenomenon.<br><br>
	<b>Varieties of resistance</b><br><br>
	(9) It could be argued that there were as many types of resistance as there were individual resisters.<br>
	(10) On another level, it is possible to distinguish between the attitude of individuals and organisations.<br>
	(11) Moving on, it is also clear that ordinary women—on their own and also as part of groups—played a significant role in the Resistance.<br>
	(12) The ‘everyday battle’ also consumed, and provoked, others.<br>
	(13) It should also be noted that resistance was very much conditional on geography.<br>
	(14) So, the most obvious characteristic of the Resistance was its diversity.<br><br>
	<i>External resistance</i><br><br>
	(15) The external resistance is, of course, the most celebrated form of resistance.<br>
	(16) Even as late as May 1940, de Gaulle was an important figure in the French government, liaising with Reynaud and advancing his own personal views about France’s proposed military strategy.<br>
	(17) Throughout this four-year period, de Gaulle did not endear himself to others.<br>
	(18) In essence, as Shennan argues, there were two main phases to the history of the external resistance.<br>
	(19) Many books have been written about de Gaulle: his life, career and political philosophy.<br>
	(20) Second, it would be fair to say that, as the war went on, de Gaulle’s politics changed.<br>
	(21) These two illustrations indicate how tactically aware de Gaulle had to be.<br>
	(22) Appropriate tactics were also crucial in other areas.<br>
	(23) It is also possible to identify other features of the political de Gaulle.<br>
	(24) Second, the notion of ‘legitimacy’ must be considered.<br>
	(25) And it is in this sense that one must acknowledge the element of destiny and prophecy inherent in de Gaulle’s posturings.<br><br>
	<i>Internal resistance</i><br><br>
	(26) The internal resistance, by contrast, was a more complicated and heterogeneous phenomenon.<br>
	(27) It would be true to say that the internal resistance had a different personality north and south of the German-imposed ‘border’.<br>
	(28) In the unoccupied zone resistance forces were up against the ultraconservative regime of Pétain and, thus, they developed a much more overtly left-wing programme, implicit in which was the belief that radical political change was desirable post-Liberation.<br>
	(29) Overall, we must acknowledge the massive diversity and serious incoherency of the France-based resistance groups.<br>
	(30) In time, the fragmentary nature of the internal forces became less of an issue.<br>
	(31) The Communist Party had been a growing influence in France during the inter-war years.<br>
	(32) The Nazi-Soviet pact may have been comprehensible when viewed in the most Machiavellian of terms—the USSR was not ready to fight; Germany wanted to carve up Poland with its new ‘ally’—but for communist parties around Europe (particularly the one in France) it gave rise to a massive moral and political conundrum.<br>
	(33) Everything changed though with the Nazis’ invasion of the USSR in 1941.<br>
	(34) It could be argued that, during the years 1941–44, the communists became the fulcrum of the Resistance.<br>
	(35) And for its part, and perhaps quite naturally, the Communist Party attempted to exaggerate its role.<br>
	(36) The Maquis on the other hand was an anarchic guerrilla-style movement which operated out of the south and was famed, primarily, for its unorthodox and often badly organised terror gangs.<br>
	(37) These qualifications are certainly necessary, but it is possible to sketch out some of the main characteristics of the Maquis.<br>
	(38) The Maquis was loosely organised, strong in rural areas, and southern-based.<br>
	(39) It would be accurate to assert, in addition, that the Maquis operated as a separate entity—though always unpredictable—for no more than two and a half years.<br>
	(40) The way in which the Maquis was viewed ‘from outside’ is also interesting.<br>
	(41) Thus, although the Maquis and the other internal resistance groups had the same enemies, and also shared some common beliefs, they were quite distinct as resistance forces.<br>
	(42) Initially, de Gaulle’s Free France grouping and the various move-ments of the internal resistance had very little in common in terms of tactics, organisation, ideology or expectations at the Liberation.<br>
	(43) There was also a lack of understanding between internal and external forces.<br>
	(44) The truth is that in 1940 and 1941 there was a chasm separating the outlook of the internal groupings and that of the external elements—so much so that many people talked of the Free French/Fighting French as if they were in some way separate from the ‘Resistance’ (which they tended to equate to the internal resistance).<br><br>
	<b>Problems and obstacles</b><br><br>
	(45) If one serious issue for the Resistance was ‘unification’, the other fundamental problem was its relationship with the Allies.<br>
	(46) The fact of the matter was that the Allies viewed de Gaulle as an unattractive personality; and whatever their supposed common interests, they did not get on.<br>
	(47) The perspective of the US was very similar.<br>
	(48) The Resistance also faced serious problems in its dealings with the colonies.<br>
	(49) Ironically—or perhaps predictably—the Liberation also brought problems, and ‘insults’, for de Gaulle.<br><br>
	<b>A movement of substance?</b><br><br>
	(50) In evaluating the nature and essence of the French resistance, it must be acknowledged that there was never such a thing as ‘the Resistance’.<br>
	(51) Clearly, the Allies had a profound influence on events in 1944 and 1945, whatever de Gaulle said in later years.<br>
	(52) It is also interesting that two historians—Cady and Shennan—have identified some common links between the Resistance and Vichy.<br>
	(53) Ousby sums things up nicely: ‘Though they might have been small in number, there were certainly <i>résistant</i>s in France from the start, and so there was resistance, which grew from insignificance to play a part in how the drama of the Occupation was acted out.<br>
	<br>
	<b>CHAPTER FOUR</b><br><br>
	<b>Liberation</b><br><br>
	<b>Freedom, hope and relief</b><br><br>
	(1) ‘By 1944,’ in the words of McMillan, ‘it was certain that the Reich would not last a thousand years.<br>
	(2) Whichever assessment one accepts, it is clear that this was an epoch-defining moment: like 1789, a landmark in French history whose significance and importance can be viewed in a whole range of different arenas.<br>
	(3) It is also very easy to fall into another trap: to believe that the Liberation was exclusively about joy, elation and untrammelled freedom, and to overlook the fact that, in reality, the years 1944, 1945 and 1946 were extremely difficult.<br>
	(4) This chapter will narrate the main phases of the Liberation and then assess whether it was a specific event that can be linked to a time and place or whether it was more of an evolutionary process.<br>
	(5) Beyond these issues, it will be interesting and necessary to explore the main themes that underpin the Liberation period.<br><br>
	<b>The process</b><br><br>
	(6) It is commonplace to reduce the Liberation to one glorious and specific event.<br>
	(7) It could be argued that the Liberation process straddled all the above events: from the ‘mini-liberations’ of 1942 and 1943 to the legal and constitutional developments of 1944 and 1946.<br>
	(8) For Kedward the key to the issue is territory.<br><br>
	<b>Transfer of power</b><br><br>
	(9) The transfer of power at the Liberation was always going to be a delicate process.<br>
	(10) Adjacent to this issue is the question of who was responsible for the Liberation.<br>
	(11) The debate about agency is a complex one.<br>
	(12) Some writers have ascribed all to de Gaulle.<br>
	(13) There is of course no doubt that de Gaulle was a central, if not indispensable, figure in both the Resistance and the Liberation.<br>
	(14) Whatever the nature and extent of de Gaulle’s involvement, the reality is that the people of France owed a profound debt of gratitude to the Allies—even if, at times, they may have been alarmed and put out by their arrogance.<br>
	(15) In 1944 there was a point when Allied military leaders sought to minimise the involvement of de Gaulle and the indigenous French forces and to by-pass Paris in the military operation that ultimately brought liberation.<br>
	(16) It is also clear that tension between de Gaulle and the Allies carried over into the arena of practicalities:<br>
	(17) We should also take account of the internal resistance and its role in 1944.<br>
	(18) In the aftermath of the Liberation a series of US posters tried to suggest that the Franco-American relationship was healthy and harmonious—and always had been.<br><br>
	<b>Themes and cross-currents</b><br><br>
	(19) If the process of the Liberation period is interesting and significant, the underlying themes are even more fascinating.<br>
	(20) The most obvious theme was hope.<br>
	(21) The themes of hope and relief are very evident in official GPRF posters issued during 1944–45.<br>
	(22) Hope and relief were central to the French mindset in 1944.<br>
	(23) For Kedward, the Liberation was an ‘opening and a closure’, a land-mark period in which France ‘looked backwards and forwards’.<br>
	(24) There was also a growing feeling that France after 1944, in economic and political terms, was being born again.<br>
	(25) The Liberation gave a strong impetus to artistic creativity.<br><br>
	<b>The purges</b><br><br>
	(26) If there was something bright and healthy about the French attitude to liberation and revival, there was also something dark and sinister lurking within the French body politic.<br>
	(27) It was perhaps inevitable that the sequel to war, occupation, collaboration and resistance would be blood-letting and a period of wholesale recriminations.<br>
	(28) Even though Barber argues that ‘Paris was a city obsessed with violence’, the general historical view is that <i>l’Épuration</i> was decidedly lenient.<br>
	(29) So, in many ways the post-war purge was aimed only at identifying, and then punishing, a suitable—and smallish—number of people.<br>
	(30) The purge was, by its very nature, calculated and cynical; because if every Frenchman ‘guilty’ of an act of collaboration was prosecuted half the population of the country would probably have been indicted.<br>
	(31) We also need to point out the relationship between <i>l’Épuration</i> and the intricate web of post-war myth-making.<br>
	(32) If, in political and legal terms, the Liberation meant <i>l’Épuration</i>, in economic terms it meant reconstruction.<br>
	(33) Reflecting this, publicity posters, which only a couple of years earlier had been dominated by ‘vulnerable’ female figures representing ‘invaded’, ‘occupied’ and ‘subservient’ France, were now monopolised by strong men with bulging biceps: ‘RETROUSSONS NOS MANCHES: ÇA IRA ENCORE MIEUX!’, ‘LES SOLDATS DONNENT LEUR SANG! LES METAL-LOS OFFRENT LEURS BRAS! TOUS AU TRAVAIL.<br><br>
	<b>Unity and disunity</b><br><br>
	(34) Dalloz argues that de Gaulle had two main aims in the weeks and months following his return to France: to re-establish state authority and to monitor the purges.<br>
	(35) Accompanying this feeling was an intriguing sense of continuity.<br>
	(36) For many historians, post-war ‘unity’ was just an illusion.<br>
	<br>
	<b>CHAPTER FIVE</b><br><br>
	<b>Legacy</b><br><br>
	<b>An era still alive</b><br><br>
	(1) It should come as no surprise to discover that the wartime period in France—dramatic, traumatic and painful—has had a profound effect on France’s national psyche in the post- Liberation period.<br>
	(2) The Liberation was the most immediate, and obvious, legacy of the wartime period.<br>
	(3) Beevor and Cooper identify three main issues in the immediate post-war period.<br>
	(4) It is also apt to cite the words of Maurois.<br>
	(5) This chapter will be divided into two main sections.<br><br>
	<b>The immediate post-war years</b><br>
	(6) Lottman might argue that the writers and intellectuals of the Left Bank enjoyed a postwar celebration that ‘seemed to last for years’, but the reality of the situation for most ordinary people was confusion, uncertainty, division and ‘disarray’.<br>
	(7) It is clear nevertheless that the competing claims of the various resistance groups helped to create a post-war climate which bordered on the frenzied.<br>
	(8) This intra-resistance squabbling was not the only type of division—merely the most obvious.<br>
	(9) It is difficult to underestimate the scale of the devastation suffered by France during the wartime years.<br>
	(10) In time, long-range planning became <i>de rigeur</i>.<br>
	(11) In the social sphere there were important developments—not least the granting of voting rights to women in 1946.<br>
	(12) One of the most interesting, and understated, legacies of the Occupation period relates to foreign policy.<br>
	(13) In another sense, it is clear that the Occupation period conditioned the nature, and main thrust, of de Gaulle’s post-war foreign policy.<br>
	(14) In many ways this was a logical policy and in line with public opinion, for the 1940s and 1950s were years of severe strain in Franco-American relations.<br>
	(15) In the short term, however, the key legacy of the wartime period was another change of regime.<br>
	(16) In reality the new Republic did not do enough for enough people.<br><br>
	<b>Right and left</b><br><br>
	(17) The confrontations and politicking of the Occupation period had significant consequences for the post-war era.<br>
	(18) Whatever the qualifications and caveats—and many of course can be made—it is clear that de Gaulle and his associates emerged triumphant from the wartime years.<br>
	(19) For the extreme right—which must be clearly differentiated from the Gaullist right— the war and its aftermath meant temporary extinction.<br>
	(20) It is Milza, however, who notes that by 1960 ‘neo-fascism’ was benefiting from the conjunction of three favourable factors: ‘the survival, during the vicissitudes of the immediate post-war, of collaborationist fascism, the acceleration in the pace of economic change, and lost colonial wars’.<br>
	(21) The Poujadist outburst of the late-1950s was also, in some ways, a legacy of the wartime period.<br>
	(22) Whereas the right suffered post-war, the left blossomed.<br>
	(23) Most potently perhaps, there is Pétain’s legacy.<br>
	(24) Whatever the fortunes of left and right, we should not forget that the immediate postwar era was also a period of <i>tripartisme</i>.<br><br>
	<b>Myth against myth</b><br><br>
	(25) In the long term, the legacy of Vichy has been just as powerful as that of the Resistance.<br>
	(26) For three decades or more, Vichy was a topic that ordinary people did not talk about in respectable company.<br>
	(27) De Gaulle’s task, however, was a tricky one.<br>
	(28) Already, therefore, we see doubt being cast on the notion of France as a ‘nation of resisters’.<br>
	(29) The decades after 1945, however, witnessed a number of developments that jeopardised the continued existence of the myth.<br><br>
	<b>The Mitterrand era</b><br><br>
	(30) The dawn of the Mitterrand presidency in 1981 gave free rein to new ‘revisionist’ attitudes.<br>
	(31) The Bousquet affair began in 1949 when he was sentenced to a three-year jail term for his actions during the war.<br>
	(32) It is clear from the headlines that accompanied the Bousquet case that a regime was being judged: ‘A FIGHT TO PUT WARTIME NIGHT-MARES TO REST’, ‘WAR CRIMES TRIAL OPENS OLD WOUNDS’, ANXIOUS TIMES FOR THOSE WITH DIRTY WAR LAUNDRY’ and ‘JUDGEMENT ON VICHY’.<br>
	(33) The case of Paul Touvier was not dissimilar to that of Bousquet.<br>
	(34) For Patrick Marnham the key aspect of the situation was that Touvier could not hope to receive a fair trial.<br>
	(35) In the aftermath of Touvier’s arrest, a national opinion poll revealed that 37 per cent of French people thought it ‘normal’ that a religious order should have protected him.<br>
	(36) These cases are interesting, but we should not lose sight of their real importance.<br>
	(37) Klaus Barbie, a German agent based in France, and Maurice Papon were also put through the same imperfect process as Bousquet and Touvier.<br>
	(38) We should, however, strike a note of caution here.<br>
	(39) The legacy of the Occupation period is a profound one.<br><br>
	<b>France today</b><br><br>
	(40) The war years have left their imprint on modern-day France.<br>
	(41) For a start there is a political party, the <i>Front National</i>, which is still acutely aware of the Occupation years.<br>
	(42) These references to the most sensitive aspects of the Occupation in FN discourse are not just haphazard.<br>
	(43) Historians of France are often reminded of the ever-present legacy of the French revolution.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Evaluation</b><br><br>
	<b>Issues and themes</b><br><br>
	(1) At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the subject of the Occupation still provokes historians and unnerves ordinary French people.<br>
	(2) In Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 we explored the Occupation, the Vichy regime and collaboration, the Resistance and the Liberation as if they were routine historical topics.<br>
	(3) Likewise, the term ‘Vichy’ still has a particularly powerful resonance in contemporary political debate: it can stir up all kinds of horrible memories for people, it can signify political betrayal and dishonesty, and it can conjure up images of a weak, humiliated and fallen nation.<br>
	(4) The word ‘resistance’ also has a mesmeric effect—but in a positive, and not a negative, way.<br>
	(5) It may be argued that France is still in <i>the midst of</i> liberation.<br>
	(6) Several key points and themes need highlighting. First, if the wartime years meant anything they meant division.<br>
	(7) Second, life in occupied France was about choices.<br>
	(8) Third, was the Occupation period an end or a beginning? The simple answer is that it was both.<br>
	(9) With hindsight it is now no longer satisfactory to depict the Occupation as merely a confrontation between ‘the good’ (the resisters) and ‘the bad’ (the Germans and the collaborators).<br>
	(10) The men who personified these two stark options were once colleagues and friends, but ended up as rivals and antagonists.<br>
	(11) The irony of course is that de Gaulle, after piloting France towards liberation, not only became disillusioned with post-war political arrangements in France but also, during and after his presidency, became deeply unpopular.<br>
	(12) Today, the many statues and commemorative plaques that grace the villages, towns and cities of France are potent reminders of the heroism of resistance, the hopes and expectations that went alongside liberation, and the awfulness and terror of the Holocaust.<br>
	(13) But it is the statues and commemorative plaques which have not been erected that tell the real story.<br>
