	<h4>The Context of Columbus</h4>
	<br>
		
		<p>
		Most books about Columbus have been biographies, which, even at their best, can seem to abstract their protagonist from his proper context. The historical tradition has concentrated on Columbus's credentials as the European 'discoverer' of America, accentuating his heroic individualism or that of rival claimants. Interest in his idiosyncratic geographical theories has fortified his singular image. He is popularly regarded as the great exemplar of timeless prowess, registering achievements in the face of contemporary derision. Washington Irving, who popularized this myth in prose, and Cole Porter, who did so in doggerel, have a lot to answer for. In reality, of course, new notes are rarely struck by one-man bands. It is true that Columbus's cosmography was admitted by only a small number of experts, but experts rarely rule, and it was on political and financial backing, not informed assent, that the launching of Columbus's enterprise depended. The background against which such backing for further Atlantic exploration became possible in Castile took shape between the 1470s and 1490s. Many events contributed: Columbus's own suit at court; the prominence and sympathy of many of his fellow-Genoese; the growth of confidence of a purposeful political leadership in and around the persons of the Catholic Monarchs; the effects of Luso-Castilian rivalry and, in some respects, of the war of Granada. The context which bound all these elements together was the progress of the conquest of the Canary Islands.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Castilian interlopers in the African trade had attracted Portuguese complaints in the previous three decades, but the war of 1474-79, in which Afonso V challenged Ferdinand and Isabella for the crown of Castile, acted as a catalyst for Castilian activity. The monarchs were open-handed with licences for voyages of piracy or carriage of contraband; the Genoese of Seville and Cadiz were keen to invest in these enterprises, and Andalusian mariners, including many who were to ship with Columbus or who made transatlantic journeys after him, were schooled in Atlantic navigation. The main action of the war took place on land in northern Castile but was accompanied by a 'small war' at sea in the latitudes of the Canaries. Castilian privateers were licensed by their monarchs to break into Portugal's monopoly of Guinea trade by force; Antonio da Noli deserted to Castile; Portuguese ships made numerous attacks on Castilian settlers in Lanzarote. The importance of the unconquered islands of the archipelago - precisely the largest and richest, Gran Canaria, La Palma and Tenerife - and the fragility of the Castilian hold on Gomera (see p.184) were thrown into prominence. 'When Ferdinand and Isabella sent a force to resume the conquest in 1478, a Portuguese expedition in seven caravels was already on its way. The intervention of the Catholic Monarchs thus has the character of a pre-emptive strike against the Portuguese.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Other, longer-maturing reasons also influenced the royal decision. First, the monarchs had other rivals than the Portuguese: the Peraza lordship of the islands had effectively descended, by marriage with Ines Peraza, to Diego de Herrera, a minor nobleman of Seville, who fancied himself as a conquistador. His claim, however, to have made vassals of nine 'kings' or native chiefs of Tenerife and two of Gran Canaria<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> was, to say the least, exaggerated. He had raided those islands in the hope of extracting tribute by terror, and had attempted, in the manner of previous conquistadores, to dominate them by erecting intimidating stone turrets. But such large, populous and indomitable islands could not be conquered by the private enterprise of a provincial hidalgo; effective conquest and systematic exploitation demanded concentrated resources and heavy investment, such as could be organized with greater readiness at court. And even had Herrera been capable of completing the conquest, it would have been unwise to permit him to do so. He was not above intrigue with the Portuguese; he might have become a turncoat, like Antonio da Noli in the Cape Verde Islands. And he was typical of the sort of truculent paladin whose power in a peripheral region was an affront to the crown. Almost since the inception of the Canarian seigneurie, lords and kings had been in dispute over the limits of royal authority in the islands. Profiting from a local rebellion against seigneurial authority in 1475-76 - one of a series of such rebellions - the monarchs determined to enforce their suzerainty and, in particular, the most important element in it, the right to be an ultimate court of appeal, throughout the colonies of the archipelago. In November of that year, they initiated an enquiry into the juridical basis of the lordships of the Canaries; embodied in an agreement between seigneur and suzerain in October, 1477, were its findings, that Herrera's rights were unimpeachable, saving the superior lordship of the crown, but that 'for certain just and reasonable causes' which were never specified, the right of conquest should revert to the crown.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Beyond the political motives for royal intervention in the Canaries were economic ones. As always in the history of Latin involvement in the African Atlantic, gold was the spur. According to a highly privileged observer, King Ferdinand's interest in the Canaries was aroused by a desire to open communications with 'the mines of Ethiopia' (that is, Africa).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> The conclusion of the Portuguese war effectively denied him access to the lucrative new gold sources developed on the underside of the African bulge, around the mouth of the Volta, in the 1480s: this must have helped to stimulate the search for alternative sources and may help to explain, for instance, the emphasis on gold in the journals of Columbus. Meanwhile, however, the conquest of the Canaries was worth completing for the islands' own sake, especially for their dyestuffs and for the potential sugar lands of the unconquered islands. Both these commodities had rapidly growing markets in Europe.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It proved almost as hard to advance the conquest under royal auspices as under those of Herrera. It took six years of unremitting campaigns to reduce Gran Canaria to submission; the conquests of La Palma and Tenerife were not considered complete until 1492 and 1496 respectively. The ferocity of native resistance was responsible in part; but finance and manpower proved almost equally hard to command. Though royal intervention had begun as an attempt to take the conquest out of private hands and bring it into the 'public' domain, as the conquest wore on private sources of money and means of recruiting tended increasingly to displace royal ones. Instead of wages, the conquistadores were promised a plot of conquered land. Instead of the yield from the sale of indulgences or the direct use of the crown's share of booty to meet the costs of the war, booty yet uncollected was pledged as rewards to conquerors who could raise the necessary finance elsewhere. By the end of the process, the conquests of La Palma and Tenerife were being financed by ad hoc companies, in which financiers and conquistadores agreed to share the proceeds.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
  		At the nerve-centre of the monarchs' war effort, scraping contingents together, assembling groups of financial backers, was Alonso de Quintanilla, a treasury official who was one of the most influential architects of policy in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. He seems to have been given responsibility for the organisation of the conquest from 1480, when dwindling returns from the sale of indulgences caused a crisis of finance. He devised a wide range of expedients, including the mortgaging of royal booty and recourse to Italian, chiefly Genoese, capitalists. In doing so he adumbrated the circle that would later contribute to the financing of Columbus. Quintanilla himself was instrumental in arranging the backing for the 'Enterprise of the Indies', as for that of the Canaries. In both cases, he was supported by key figures, the Genoese merchants of Seville, Francesco Pinelli and Francesco da Rivarolo. Pinelli had been involved in Canarian finance for as long as Quintanilla, as he administered the receipts of the sale of indulgences on the monarchs' behalf from March, 1480; Quintanilla's first personal subvention was made in April. Pinelli went on to acquire the first sugar mill on Gran Canaria and make loans to the conquerors of La Palma and Tenerife. For his part as a backer of Columbus, the monarchs made him one of the first administrators of the Indies trade when it was organised as a royal monopoly in 1497. Francesco da Rivarolo may have done even better out of the whole affair. There is no evidence that he contributed personally to the conquest of Gran Canaria, but his son-in-law was one of the biggest investors, and the Rivarolo family was a close-knit business partnership carefully managed by the patriarchal Francesco. He took part in the financing of the conquests of La Palma and Tenerife in his own right and became the richest merchant in the archipelago, with interests essentially, but not exclusively, concentrated in sugar and dyestuffs. He was a mainstay of Columbus, whose fourth voyage he financed and who later dwelt in his house. Some non-Genoese of Seville from the fringes of Columbus's world' also took a hand in paying for the conquest of the Canaries: the Duke of Medina Sidonia, whom Columbus saw as a possible patron; Gianotto Beraldi, Florentine (according to most sources), who had a share of the New World trade in its early years. But the balance was strongly Genoese. The same is broadly true of the financial circle that sustained Columbus or advanced money for his voyages. There seems to have been sufficient overlap for the conquest of the Canaries and the discovery of America to be seen, to some extent, as the work of the same group of men. The Genoese of Seville played, for Castile in the Atlantic, a role similar to that of the Florentines of Lisbon in the impulsion of Portugal into the Indian Ocean a few years later.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
		</p>
		
		
  		<p>
  		The Canaries were a vital part of the context of Columbus in a further sense: they provided him with his starting point. The port of San Sebastian de la Gomcra, from which he set sail, was uniquely suited to his purpose: no deep-water harbour was further west, none closer to the path of the north-east trade winds that would carry him across the Atlantic. It is probably no exaggeration to say that, but for the accidents which made the Canaries Castilian, the New World could not have become predominantly Spanish. Attempts to explore the Atlantic from the Portuguese islands of the Azores, like that of Ferdinand van Olmen in 1487, were doomed to be turned back by the prevailing winds. Gomera only became a safe starting point in 1489, when the last native rebellion was crushed by a force' of conquistadores from the lately conquered Gran Canaria. The event left the island in the hands of the exmistress of the king and widow of Gomera's administrator, Dona Beatriz de Bobadilla, who had probably met Columbus in Cordova in 1486.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a>
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<br>
  		<h4>The Last Canarian Conquests</h4>
  		<br>
  		
  		<p>
  		The conquests of Gran Canaria, La Palma and Tenerife and of the last native insurgents of Gomera, which form the immediate backdrop to the creation of a Castilian empire in the New World, belong to the traditions of Iberian expansion within the peninsula, in the Mediterranean and in Africa - conceived, or at least represented, in the same way, as 'crusades' or extensions of the 'Reconquest', justified to a remarkable extent in the same terms, 'written up' by chroniclers in the same chivalric language. But before these elements of continuity can be explained, the course of the conquests must be summarised.
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		Two observations made by one of the most insightful of contemporary chroniclers are helpful for an understanding of the conquests. Although the natives were neolithic 'savages', literally armed with sticks and stones, their stratagems and the defensible terrain brought them frequent victories over technically superior adversaries. And the conquest made 'continuous' demands on the scant resources which Ferdinand's and Isabella's heavily committed monarchy could spare for the task. A remark of the chronicler, the royal secretary, Hernin de Pulgar, about Gran Canaria could be extended to the natives of the other islands as well: they might have proved insuperable, but for the internal rivalries which the conquistadores exploited.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> As in Naples, Granada, Mexico and Peru, Castilian conquerors were the beneficiaries of indigenous civil wars.
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		Undermanned and irregularly provisioned, for the first three years of the conquest of Gran Canaria, the Castilians contented themselves with making 'entradas' or raids by land on native villages. Working for wages, and therefore with little incentive to acquire territory, the recruits from urban militia forces did not touch the mountain fastnesses on which the Canarians used to fall back for defence. Rather, they concentrated on places in the low plains and hills, where food, not fighting could be found - the plains where the natives grew their cereals, the hillsides up and down which they shunted their goats. It was a strategy of mere survival, not of victory. Between raids, the invaders remained in their stockade at Las Palmas, where inactivity bred insurrection. The arrival of Pedro de Vera as military governor in 1480 inaugurated more purposeful strategies: he planned amphibious operations to the otherwise barely accessible west coast and t~e erection of another stockade - a 'second front' - at Gaete. But his first major victory was the result of a miscalculation by the defenders, who descended to the plain of Tamaraseite near Las Palmas, to offer 'conventional' battle with disastrous results: if the chronicler Diego de Valera can be believed, de Vera slew the most formidable native chief in a suspiciously knightly or Homeric encounter, with his own hand.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Towards the end of 1480 or early 1481 the natives' seedtime brought a lull in hostilities, probably formalized by a mass baptism, to which the natives would have submitted cheerfully enough, without understanding much of its significance. Certainly a group of chiefs or notables whom the Spaniards had captured and in some sense converted, arrived the court of Ferdinand and Isabella in May, 1481. The Catholic monarchs wished to impress these new subjects with their clemency as well as their power and, urged on by ecclesiastical advisers, desired to speed the conversion of other Canarians by a timely display of Christian charity. They bestowed a letter of privilege, declaring they had taken the people of Gran Canaria 'beneath our protection and royal defence, like the Christians they are' and guaranteeing their right to move and trade among Castilian dominions on an equal footing with Castilian-born subjects, as well as promising freedom from enslavement.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> For the time being these stipulations held good and the recipients of this charter must have been well satisfied with their own achievements as well as dazzled by those of the monarchs. From that time on, the movement of 'loyalism' among the natives grew, so that in the coming campaigns Pedro de Vera was able to play off rival factions as a means to final victory. In particular, the capture and conversion of one of the most important chiefs, known to tradition as Tenesor Semidan but better identified by his baptismal name of Don Fernando Guanarteme, in February, 1482, immeasurably strengthened de Vera's hand, as Don Fernando was able to induce many of his compatriots, especially around his power base in the north of the island, to submit.
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		Yet victory still proved elusive and, frustrated by the inaccessibility of the insurgents of the south who held out in the central mountains, beyond perilous goat walks and precipitous defiles, Pedro de Vera turned to a policy of terror and of scorched earth. Innocent natives were burnt to death in reprisal for the loss of Spanish soldiers. Supplies and livestock were seized to deny them to the enemy. Gradually, coerced by these tactics, or persuaded by the eloquence of Don Fernando, the natives surrendered. Some abandoned hope and ended their struggle by self-immolation, flinging themselves from terrible heights, chillingly described by Spanish chronicles. A remnant continued resistance with justified confidence, for even in the winter of 1483, stalked in a remote defile by a corps of Basque freelances, they were able to win a remarkable victory by their usual practice of precipitating an avalanche against the enemy column. De Vera implicitly acknowledged that force could not prevail against them on their chosen terrain: he withdrew to Las Palmas and invited his adversaries to make honourable terms. Apart from rebels who continued to roam the mountain tops for a few years, without inflicting any serious damage, the entire island was held to have submitted by the summer of 1483.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a>
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		The condition of Gomera in the 1480s sets its experience apart from that of the other islands. Unique among islands still occupied by natives in having resident Castilian lords, it was also unique among 'conquered' islands, because the indigenous population remained undisturbed (except for the exaction of tribute by the Peraza family) and undisplaced by European colonists. Its very singularity was its undoing. The Genoese financiers of the conquest of the Canaries are unlikely to have tolerated the abandonment of potential sugar lands indefinitely to native herders and gatherers; while the recurring tension between the Peraza and their reluctant 'vassals' made the status quo unstable and gave the crown a pretext for intervention. Gomera's traditional links with the Portuguese, who, as we have seen, strove for an understanding with the natives at intervals from the 1430s, may also have aroused Castilian apprehension. The natives rebelled in 1478, taking the opportunity of the Luso-Castilian war to 'procure favours from Portugal', as was alleged by the Peraza and believed by Ferdinand and Isabella. A further rebellion in 1484 can be inferred from the monarchs' warning that they should obey their lords and pay their tribute. By 1488, they were again in revolt. In 1488 and 1489, royal forces from Gran Canaria made two brutal incursions, between which Hermin Peraza, who ruled the island on his family's behalf, was put to death by the natives. In revenge, the rebels were executed or enslaved in droves, with dubious legality, as 'rebels against their natural lord', and the island permanently garrisoned from Gran Canaria. The treatment of the natives touched tender consciences in Castile; the monarchs established an inquiry by a committee of jurists and theologians into the proprieties of the case; the release of the enslaved Gomerans was recommended and many of them eventually returned to the archipelago to help colonise other conquests.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Their native land, however, was now ripe for transformation by European settlers. In the next decade, it became another colonial sugar island.
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		The conquests of Tenerife and La Palma were relatively rapid but by no means easy. In neither case was success effected by prowess - despite the chivalric postures struck by the Spaniards in the sources - but in the one case by stratagem and in the other by luck. Alonso de Lugo's invasion of La Palma in 1492 was preceded by the missionary activities of a remarkable woman: the native neophyte, Francisca de Gazmira. That an episcopal licence should have been conferred on a lay, native, female missionary suggests remarkable charismatic powers which she seems to have used to good effect among her people.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> It was perhaps thanks to this preparation that Lugo encountered little opposition and some help when he landed on the western seaboard. Reinforced by Christian tribes of the west, he marched around the coast in a clockwise direction, defeating piecemeal tribes who made no effort to unite in resistance. The interior was the scene of a fiercer defence, for there volcanic activity and erosion have combined to create a vast natural fortress, La Caldera, which was occupied by a single tribe under a leader whom tradition calls Tanausu. If our sole but tardy source can be believed, Tanausu might have resisted indefinitely had Lugo not tricked him into attending a sham parley, at which he was overcome and his followers decimated.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> Here, for once, the chronicle tradition seems to depart from an heroic version of events. The surviving text dates from the 1590s, when such bold revisionists as the Dominican, Fray Alonso de Espinosa, were challenging the received image of the conquest of the Canaries, praising the natural virtues of the natives and defending their rights. No doubt this version is as warped as that of the contemporary chronicles, which reflect a perception saturated in chivalric literature. But cruelty and ruthless daring are thoroughly characteristic of everything that is known for certain about Alonso de Lugo.

  		Partly, perhaps, because of his early reputation for rapacity, Lugo's operations thereafter were bedevilled by shortage of finance and legal entanglements with his Genoese (and" in one case, Majorcan) backers. He narrowly averted disaster in both the campaigns to which the conquest of Tenerife committed him. From the first, which occupied the summer of 1494, he barely escaped the near destruction of his force with his life after being lured into a trap at Acentejo near the mouth of the Orotava valley. He was probably making for the land of Taoro - the richest of nine territorial and tribal chieftaincies into which the island seems to have been divided.
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		<p>
  		He returned with larger forces, probably late in 1495, disabused of his first facile expectation that the conquest would take ten months. Now, however, it was the turn of the chief of Taoro to succumb to overconfidence. That overweening native prince had driven four tribes into alliance with Lugo; the remainder formed a hostile confederacy, which attacked Lugo's camp near La Laguna in the flat terrain that suited the Spaniards' cavalry and gave the islanders little protection from crossbow fire. Even after the inevitable victory, Lugo remained in winter quarters. When he gingerly sallied forth, early in 1496, he found the natives depleted and debilitated by an unidentified epidemic - the first of a series of mysterious diseases, presumably brought by the Europeans, which caused a demographic disaster in Tenerife, comparable, on the islands' smaller scale, to those which later devastated the New World. Lugo resumed his march on Taoro. This time, when he reached Acentejo, he was prepared and avenged the former massacre in a definitive victory. The last chief of Taoro sent his despair the way of his hope and committed ritual suicide, just as some of the defenders of Gran Canaria had done. Surprisingly, no chronicler mentions the event, but the spot where the chief ended his life became a celebrated landmark and is referred to in many early land grants to colonists. After this, the tribes who remained in arms quickly made their submissions and by June, 1496, Alonso de Lugo was able to parade their leaders before his monarchs, under the eyes of the Venetian ambassador, at Almazan.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a>

  		<h4>Granada, the Ganaries and America</h4>
  		<br>
  		
  		
  		<p>
	  	The completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands is very close in time to the first conquests in the New World and the last in the Iberian peninsula. Indeed, the overlap is striking, as the conquest's of the greater Canaries, from 1478 to 1496, encompassed the years of the Granada War and of Columbus's first two voyages. The crucial question is whether there was any conceptual continuity, because, if people thought of all three conquests in the same way, then there may have been a basis for continuity in other respects- institutional, economic, social.
  		</p>
  		
  		
	  	<p>
	  	The juridical passion of Castilian monarchs and their advisers, the obsessive desire to justify in theory - even more, perhaps, than to vindicate in practice - all their doings and especially all their wars, means that their conceptions were often made explicit. The evidence is overwhelming that the conquest of the Canaries was conceived and justified, not only by the monarchs and their advisers, but also at quite humble social and intellectual levels, as an extension of the 'Reconquest', not much different in kind from the subjugation of Granada. The myth of the Reconquest became deeply imbedded in late medieval Spain. It fed on the period's 'Gothic revival' - a pervasive interest in the history of Visigothic Spain and, particularly, in the monarchs' claim to be heirs of the Gothic kings. In the first Castilian reference to the islands, from a letter of the mid-fourteenth century, King Alfonso XI informed the pope - mistakenly but without apparent insincerity - that his prede,cessors had fought 'the kings of Africa' for those lands and that 'the acquisition of the Kingdom of Africa is well known to pertain to our royal right and no other'. The same or like arguments were not forgotten in the next century, as is apparent from the submissions of one of the most accomplished Castilian jurists of the day, Alonso de Cartagena, who alleged that the Canaries were part of the realms of the Visigothic kings, or at least fell within their rights of conquest: rights which descended with their regality through the line of monarchs of Castile. The same train of thought was current still in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella: witnesses into the enquiry into the status of the Canarian seigneury in 1476-77 believed that the islands had belonged to Don Rodrigo, the last Gothic king. Arguments reminiscent of Alonso de Cartagena's were recapitulated by Cardinal Carvajal on an embassy to Rome in 1494.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	Though its adversaries happened to be infidels, the concept of the 'Reconquest' was secular in part, because in just war theory, as derived from St Augustine, recovery of usurped lands was a valid pretext, whoever the foe. Despite some fantastic attempts - like Oviedo's speculation that the New World might have been part of the realm of King Tubal - the conquest of America could not be convincingly represented in these terms, nor justified on a basis derived solely from a civil-law tradition. Remarkably, therefore - into a world where Christ and Muhammad had never been heard of- echoes of the religious language associated with the 'Reconquest' crossed the Atlantic. Although not formally dignified by crusading indulgences, Castile's American wars were justified by evangelical zeal and sanctified by apparitions of St James. In this respect, the Canary Islands really do look like a conceptual 'half-way house' between Spain and America. The conquests, up to and including that of Gran Canaria, were crusades in the technical sense, for which indulgences equivalent to those of the Holy Land pilgrimage were proclaimed by the popes. And not only were Canarian wars thought of as extensions of the 'Reconquest': the inhabitants seem actually to have been muddled with Moors. For a Venetian ambassador, Don Fernando Guanarteme was 'a Saracen king'. The conquistadores and royal chancery, in making terms with Canarians, adopted the formulae developed during the wars against the Moors and deployed at the time in the 'capitulations' or surrender terms of Granadine cities. It was common for Moors to be ritually 'challenged' to submit before conflict (indeed, this may have been a Moorish practice borrowed by the chivalric world), and the same opportunity was given, if the chroniclers are to be believed, to the Canarians before major encounters. The terms granted to the Canarian vanquished of 1481, which we have described, closely echoed those of surrendering Moors.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	In practical and juridical terms, however, the Canarians were unlike the Moors, yet remarkably similar to some of the peoples the Castilians were about to encounter on the other side of the ocean. Their apparent primitivism, as we shall see in the next chapter, set them apart; and, where the Moors were contumacious infidels, they were ignorant pagans who had not explicitly rejected the gospel. As the conquest wore on, the terms offered to the islanders seemed to move away from the model suggested by the Moors and to anticipate the conceptual framework of the early conquests of American Indians; the act of submission was represented as a voluntary reception of Christianity and an acknowledgement that, far from possessing internal sovereignty, the natives were by nature or divine will subjects of the Castilian crown. These terms were recorded in the charter of 1480: 'Reduced and converted to our Holy Catholic Faith, they sent to us to render and tender their obedience and fealty and acknowledged us as their king and queen and natural lords.' Chronicles record numerous offers of similar terms.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> It must be remembered, however, that Spanish attitudes were protean and unsystematic. For roughly the first half-century of Spanish conquest in the New World, Castilians' conceptions of their rights and of the Indians' status were moulded by reliance on the papal donation - something never admitted in the Canaries. And, even in 1492, it was possible for the natives of Tenerife to be conceived by conquistadores as a sovereign community. One of the most curious documents in the history of the Spanish empire records that in the summer of that year, one of the conquerors of Gran Canaria, Lope de Salazar, went to Tenerife to make a treaty ('a concertar pazes') with one of the tribes; its terms are unknown but it was a unique case of natives treated on equal terms without starting from an inferior juridical position. The crown's representatives on Gran Canaria honoured Lope's treaty with, if anything, supererogatory zeal: in 1493, when the peacemaker seized three native slaves, the governor pretended to agree to their sale but sent his son with a police force to impound the captives and arrest Lope de Salazar as a 'treaty-breaker’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	What were the implications, for colonial development, of these elements of conceptual continuity? Although the period of formation of colonial society in Granada, the New World and the major islands of the Canaries lies outside the terms of reference of this book, the essential points demand to be made. The three areas presented widely differing environments which imposed contrasting patterns of settlement and different institutions of government. Granada had an established rural economy and international trade, whereas that of the Canaries had to be constructed ab initio and that of the New World transformed to meet European tastes and needs. Granada was an enviable land, conquered by the monarchs in person with the sort of mixture of 'feudal' host and urban militia as had been traditional in Spain; it had a large native population, too, and all three elements had at first to be accommodated: Granada became a mixture of big fiefs and peasant properties, about evenly matched.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> In the New World, the greater Castilian aristocracy neither sought nor got a stake while the huge indigenous labour force precluded settlement at low social levels until demographic disasters supervened. The Canaries had no such labour force; and in the major islands of the archipelago sugar rapidly came to dominate the economy. Thus the predominant pattern was of big merchant proprietors served by sharecroppers of European - and chiefly Portuguese - origin. The only cases which seem to stand outside this pattern are those of the Duke of Medina Sidonia (the one magnate who contributed to the conquest and who in the Canaries was, through his agents, an active merchant rather than a rentier) and the Church, which possessed the only fief granted with rights of jurisdiction by the monarchs in the islands conquered in their reign.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	This raises the question of how Castilian conquests were governed and how 'feudal' they were - that is, in this context, how far jurisdiction was reserved to the crown and administered by bureaucrats, or how far it was devolved to local wielders of landed wealth. In Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella were generous with jurisdictional fiefs, but in the Canaries and the New World they and their successors made such grants sparingly or - in most of the territories - not at all and fought hard against the seigniorial pretensions of some conquistadores: the privileges of the Peraza were modestly whittled down; Alonso de Lugo was encumbered with a succession of bureaucratic 'lieutenants'; Columbus was never allowed to exercise the jurisdiction rashly granted him on paper; Cortes was compensated with an admittedly substantial fief for the loss of what threatened to become a territorial principality; conquistadores' rights to the labour services or tributes of Indians in the New World were of strictly limited heritability and were, in the royal conception if not always in practice, regarded as incompatible with the exercise of jurisdiction or the concept of vassalage; a royal army crushed the aspirations to effective independence of the conquerors of Peru, and a network of royal tribunals and itinerant judges was gradually spread all over the New World to make royal justice increasingly accessible and immediate. Within Castile, seigniorial jurisdiction made gains at royal expense in the course of the sixteenth century. In their overseas possessions, however, it was as if the monarchs had seized with relief a tabula rasa, which they were determined to prick with their own stylus.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	Nevertheless, in three very important respects it is useful to speak of feudal models in Castilian overseas expansion. First, as Charles Verlinden has argued, the starting points - the lordships of Bettencourt and the Peraza, the jurisdictional 'admiralcy' of Columbus - assumed the alienation ofjurisdiction from the crown, and were expressed in the language of lordship and vassaldom.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> In this respect, Castilian expansion was like that of all the other cases we have noticed. Secondly, the soi-disant hidalgos who lorded it over small colonists in the islands or called the natives their 'vassals' in the New World, did not see things from the royal perspective: if not of feudalism, the empire was a world of feudal pretension. Finally, it is true that grants of land and labour services were the most important element in royal policy throughout the empire - at least, for most of the first half of the sixteenth century. They were the means by which exploitation was organised and loyalty tenuously secured. The disposal of substantial rewards of the conquests in patronage forms a link between the peninsular conquests, the Canaries and the New World and distinguishes them collectively from the monarchs' inherited patrimony, which was, by universal agreement albeit not in unwavering practice, inalienable.

	  	<h4>The 'Rise' of Portugal and Castile</h4>
	  	<br>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	Traditionally, the problem of Portugal's emergence as a long-range commercial and imperial power has looked more difficult than it is. Misplaced emphasis on the early fifteenth century - to the exclusion of the long fourteenth-century apprenticeship and the belittlement of the late fifteenth-century leap forward - has made the phenomenon seem dramatic, while misrepresentation of the Infante Dom Henrique has made it seem heroic. Seen in proper context, the emergence of Portuguese imperialism appears more intelligible. The same is true of Castile's education for empire in Andalusia and the Canaries. Yet Castile and Portugal still seem imperfectly fitted for their roles, while the exclusion or pre-emption of other, superficially more likely candidates, demands to be explained.
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	It may be helpful to recall that the Portuguese phenomenon was not unique. Two hundred years later, the Dutch did something very similar, from a comparable starting point. Both peoples were marginal 'poor relations' of Christendom, numerically feeble, concentrated in coastal settlements where they mingled peasant and piscatorial vocations. Both had experienced recent or current civil wars. Both had maritime traditions based on fishing, with commercial and industrial origins linked to the salting and marketing of fish - cod in the Portuguese case, herring in that of the Dutch. Both practiced shipping and piracy in neighboring seas for a long time before taking up their imperial vocations. Both looked out on the Atlantic but had Mediterranean apprenticeships- the Portuguese as corsairs and carriers in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Dutch as pirates and grain shippers in the late sixteenth. Both had rich industrial and urban neighbours who brought in capital and expertise: the Florentines and Genoese to Lisbon, the Flemings to Amsterdam. Looked at together, both cases begin to seem less astonishing. What appeared to be poor equipment begins to resemble a syndrome of success.
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	None of this, however, helps to explain why Portugal- much less Castile - was not preceded in the Atlantic by the French, the Catalans or the Genoese. France was the richest and most populous kingdom in Christendom. She had Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards. Her lands had been nurseries of crusaders and of Mediterranean, Levantine and Iberian colonists throughout the high middle ages. The Barbary crusades show that on the eve of European expansion into the Atlantic, this tradition was not dead. There were communities of long-distance Atlantic fishermen in northern France, just as there were in Portugal. What we have seen of the history of Bettencourt’s and La Salle's expedition shows how nearly the Atlantic became French; but it shows, too, why Iberian powers had a crucial geographical advantage. By the standards of the time, the eastern Atlantic was still a perilous sea and the Atlantic archipelagoes distant and dangerous places. Bethencourt switched his allegiance to Castile for the sake of a short lifeline and a handy base. Appeals to the internal divisions of France explain nothing: the achievements of the Genoese, Catalans and Dutch and, to a lesser extent, of Portuguese and Castilians were all launched from home bases riven by dissension. Nor would it be convincing to dwell on France's supposed 'continental destiny' - her commitment to a strategy of European hegemony, imposed by her long and vulnerable land frontier: the country of western Europe with the longest land frontier, relative to its size, is Portugal. More significant, perhaps, was France's position outside the main sea routes that linked the Mediterranean and northern. economies in the late middle ages. Early commerce from Genoa or Majorca touched at La Rochelle or Nantes, but from the first the Bay of Biscay was uncongenial: even galleys preferred to skirt it; and increasingly they made their runs directly for the English Channel from Baiona or another Galician or, occasionally, Cantabrian port. Even a galley could complete the voyage in a week or, exceptionally, as little as three days. The big Genoese round ships, carracks and cogs, went straight from Seville or Cadiz.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	The Catalan failure is more difficult to understand. It has to be set in the context of a long period of climacteric from the late fourteenth to the late fifteenth centuries, in which the Crown of Aragon gradually and fitfully yielded its prominence in the affairs of Latin Christendom, and in which the commercial might of Catalonia shrank in relation to that of other trading peoples. This 'decline of Catalonia' is one of the great unsolved puzzles of late medieval history. Like the superficially similar problem of the 'decline of Spain' in the seventeenth century, it may to some extent be a matter of distorted perceptions rather than of real decadence, and of relative rather than absolute decline. The great age of Catalan achievement in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, like that of Castile in the sixteenth, aroused false expectations. Spectacular victories masked the poverty and vulnerability of the domestic base. Resources were overstreteched and energy wasted - especially in the Catalan case, as we have seen, on the Sardinian wars. In the fifteenth century, Catalonia was still robust in many ways; some new openings were exploited and Catalan Levantine trade through Rhodes seems to have increased. If Barcelona was in decline, Valencia was growing.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> But just as in the seventeenth century the strength of France and the spectacular rise of northern European powers broke the Spanish hegemony and reduced Spain to more limited ambitions, so in the fifteenth century Catalonia was eclipsed by redistributions of forces which created new great powers at either end of the Mediterranean - the Turks in the east, Castile in the west. Why, specifically, did the Catalans withdraw from the Atlantic? From the mainland and Majorca, they had led the Atlantic 'space race' in its early phase; their 'imperial' experience was arguably the most relevant of all potentially interested peoples'. Their commercial motivation must have been at least as strong as that of their rivals. It is tempting to see them excluded from the route to Atlantic archipelagoes by Portuguese control of Ceuta; but the Catalan withdrawal seems to predate that event. The last explicit known evidence of Aragonese attempts to maintain mastery of the seas around the Canaries dates from 1366 (see p.158). Abandonment of the Atlantic may have been a sort of rational economy at a time when Mediterranean commitments were vast and growing. The Aragonese protectorate in the Maghrib gave Catalan traders an established 'route of gold'; further Atlantic exploration was a desperate recourse, of which the Portuguese, Castilians and Genoese had greater need. Catalan traders did return to the Atlantic archipelagoes in the sixteenth century, but only in the wake of Castilian war fleets.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a>
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
	  	The last of the potential rivals of Portugal and Castile was in many ways the most formidable of all. The Iberian empires depended on Genoese capital and expertise. Why then did no Genoese Atlantic empire in its own right ever take shape? Apart from an emblem of Genoese sovereignty painted over one of the Canary Islands in the Dulcert map, there is no evidence of any Genoese wish to go beyond the vicarious enjoyment of the profits of Atlantic exploitation. Part of the explanation lies in the nature of the Iberian empires themselves, part in the Genoese tradition. The privileged position of Genoese merchants in Portugal and Castile provided convenient bases for Atlantic operations; their control of resources and their profits on loans could be maintained, at most times, without political control. Their covert colonialism throve in a setting where the Castilians and Portuguese provided manpower and might, the Genoese capital and technical prowess. At times, doubts were expressed in Portugal and Castile about the distributions of the benefits of this informal bargain. In the late fifteenth century, attempts were made to expel or exploit the Genoese of the Atlantic islands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Castilian monarchs attempted to exclude Genoa from the New World and, for a while, to replace the Genoese as the holders of the monarchy's debts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> Involvement in Portugal and Castile seems justified; the Genoese strategy of indirect control was a success.
	  	</p>
	  	
	  	
	  	<p>
		It was not, of course, a consciously evolved strategy. Genoa, even in the heyday of Mediterranean expansion, never created an etatiste empire on the Venetian model. Collective action was impossible in the hurly-burly of Genoese politics. Empire-building was the work of outcast entrepreneurs, aristocratic adventurers, freebooter factions excluded from civic life or autonomous companies of merchant- conquerors like the Maona of Chios. It was rare for Genoa to hold substantial colonies in anything approaching full sovereignty. The network of Genoese merchant-quarters was the most strictly commercial of the medieval Mediterranean 'empires'. The biggest Genoese traders in Portugal, the Lomellini, were creole expatriates who behaved as if unbeholden to Genoa's state interests; they operated along routes of their own, between Lisbon and Bruges, with Castilian, French and even Irish ports which the merchants of Genoa proper neglected. The Lomellini were an extreme case, but they show how the emulous character of Genoa's commercial life made Genoa's 'empire' fissile. The role of the Genoese within the empires of Portugal and Castile was thoroughly consistent with the parts they had played in the empires of Byzantium and of the House of Barcelona.
	  	</p>
		
		
		<p>
  		Apart from Genoese surrogacy, it is the Canary Islands that are the key to everything that is most spectacular in the rise of Castile. Allegretto Allegretti thought America <i>was</i> 'another Canary Island'. It may have been on that sort of confusion that Castile based her claim to the New World before the papal donation, for her treaty rights with Portugal assigned her any 'islands of Canary, still to be discovered’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> It was barely more than twice as far from Gomera to Santo Domingo as from Cadiz to Gomera in terms of days of sail.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
  		Yet if the islands were physically close to the New World and anticipated some of the features of colonial societies as they would take shape in the remoter Atlantic, we have repeatedly seen how close they were, in the 'tone' set by the colonists, to the metropolitan world, from which they were a means of escape and of which they were a bodged recreation. In the colonies, Canarian and American alike, the institutions and economies of home were necessarily modified. But a tenacious spirit, an enduring self-perception, survived these changes. What was this 'spirit'? One of the most popular new books of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella was the one described in Don Quixote as 'the best in the world' - the Tirant lo blanc of Joan Martorell, an extravagant chivalric romance, in which one of the characters is a 'king of the Canary Islands', who launches, with presumably conscious irony on the author's part, an invasion of Europe. The erection of an island-kingdom is a common denouement in works of the genre: in <i>Don Quixote</i>, the tradition is derided through Sancho Panza's aspiration to rule an island. When the Catholic monarchs added the style of 'King and Queen of the Canary Islands' to the list of titles with which they headed their letters, they were exceeding fiction and making a reality of romance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> The same spirit had been evinced by the Peraza and the chroniclers of the conquest of the Canaries. If we were to continue the history of Castilian empire-building into the New World, we should see it there too in overwhelmingly the greater part of conquistadores' surviving literary allusions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> The world of Castilian naval warfare is the world of Count Pero Niiio, whose chronicle, written by his standard-bearer in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, is a treatise of chivalry as well as an account of campaigns: <i>El vitorial</i> celebrates a knight never vanquished in joust or war or love, whose greatest battles were fought at sea; and 'to win a battle is the greatest good and the greatest glory of life'. When the author discourses on the mutability of life, his interlocutors are Fortune and Wind, whose 'mother' is the sea 'and therein is my chief office'.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> The rise of a Castilian overseas empire, no less - as we have seen - than those of Portugal or of the House of Barcelona, owed a great deal to the strength of chivalric values and to the influence of chivalric romance.
