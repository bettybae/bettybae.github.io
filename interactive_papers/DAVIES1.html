	<p><b>[PAGE 5]</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p><p><b>Occupation</b></p><p><b>French and Germans</b></p><p><blockquote>A feeling of rape (<i>Un sentiment de viol</i>)<br><br>Henri Frenay on the Occupation<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></blockquote></p><p>The Occupation of France was heralded by Article 1 of the Franco-German Armistice, signed in June 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> This notorious document announced that Germany would be occupying northern and western regions of the country; approximately 35 million French people would, therefore, have to live under direct German tutelage. Agulhon talks about the occupied zone as the ‘third quarter of the disjointed nation’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> Kedward argues that, initially, French people thought of the Occupation in military terms only and ‘did not envisage it in either political or economic terms’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> while Larkin says that the attitude of most French people was ‘stunned acceptance’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> In the second half of 1940, the Nazis launched a systematic campaign of pro-German, anti-British propaganda.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a></p><p>By 1942 Germany had moved into the southern zone. The Occupation was, by then, complete. We must remember that occupation was not a new experience for France. She had suffered the same fate, albeit for much shorter durations, in 1814, 1871 and 1914. Occupation 1940-style, however, was to be on an altogether different scale. In time it was to become a military, social, economic, political and psychological reality; and it would leave an indelible stain on the nation’s psyche.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Naturally, the Occupation had an immediate and varied impact. The most obvious effect was dislocation. As German troops swarmed into France, a mass of people ‘emigrated’ from the north to the south. This ‘exodus’ involved women and children primarily and, in the decades since, has gained mythical status; in photographs and newsreel film it has been depicted graphically.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Ousby has explored this theme further and called his chapter on the Occupation: ‘Presence and absence’. Alluding to the writings of Sartre, he declares: The occupation began by demanding that people accept the fact of presence, the presence of a foreign conqueror in their midst. Yet increasingly it demanded that they also reconcile themselves to the fact of absence, or rather to a series of absences which began with the disappearance of friends, neighbours or fellowcitizens and pointed towards a vacancy of the spirit, an engulfing nothingness.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> At its most stark, the Occupation meant a climate of fear and suspicion. Larkin claims that there was a safe ‘middle ground’ between resistance and collaboration but that, in practice, everyone was in a state of ‘moral disarray’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a></p><p>However, it would be a mistake to view the Occupation, solely, as a crude Nazi strategy — as, if you like, ‘France under the swastika’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Of course, in many ways this was what the Occupation was all about; but, in another way, the Occupation can be viewed as a clever and subtle strategy. For, splitting France in two was a brilliant example of ‘divide and rule’ thinking in action. Creating an ‘independent’ southern zone was a definite tactic. In essence, from the German standpoint, the thinking was: give the French some independence, let them squabble among themselves, and let us not exert unnecessary energy on governing areas of France that have no great economic utility. Kedward expands on this point:</p><p><blockquote>The division between the zones which had seemed a thin line on a map was gradually seen for what it really was, a military frontier which the Germans could close or open at will, and in the first weeks after the armistice it was opened only to selected workers and administrators whom the Germans decided were vital to the smooth recovery of basic industries and public services in Paris and the north. By leaving as many people as possible to French initiatives in the south, the Germans ensured that grievances about food and other provisions were directed against French rather than German authorities. It was part of their tactics for maximising the effects of the war and defeat for which the French would be held responsible, and minimizing the effects of the Occupation which could be held against themselves.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a></blockquote></p><p>The Germans ruled France via a military governor. He had large freedom of action in both political and economic domains. In general though, he had only one aim: to maintain order and stability. He was aided by staff in Paris and the regions, and also by a well oiled police and propaganda machine. These were important dimensions to the German presence in France, but the key relationship was that between the Military Governor and the German Ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz. What existed, therefore, was a kind of cabinet-style operation: the Military Governor and the Ambassador working in tandem with a small group of councillors. Together, they possessed a good working knowledge of France and French affairs.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a></p><p>In the next chapter we will examine the Vichy regime and the policy of collaboration, and in Chapter 3 we will explore the reality of the Resistance, in all its diversity and plurality. In these two chapters, the ‘headline’ political issues will be examined and important insights will be gained into the nature of both political ‘factions’ and, through this, into the nature of the profound fault-line that existed in wartime France. This chapter, however, will focus on the political, military, social and economic undercurrents of the Occupation. There are three main issues: <i>Origins</i>: why did the Occupation take place? <i>Reality</i>: what did the Occupation mean in practice? <i>Implications</i>: how should we assess the effects, consequences, and legacy, of the Occupation?</p><p>So, in this chapter the nature and everyday reality of the Occupation and the social and economic effects of the German invasion will be considered. For the most part, the situation in the occupied zone will interest us. Occasionally though, it will be helpful to take a more holistic view of the Occupation; at times, therefore, it will be useful to take examples and illustrations from the southern unoccupied zone. <b>[PAGE 7]</b></p><p><b>Beginnings</b></p><p>How and why did Nazi Germany commence its Occupation? More specifically, what was the rationale behind the policy? What was Hitler’s tactical thinking? What was the significance of the Armistice and the ramifications of the Montoire meeting? The Armistice of June 1940 was an event tinged with vengeance. Hitler held the meeting with Pétain in an old railway carriage — an explicit reminder of the 1918 meeting when the roles were reversed and France was in the ascendant. At the start of the chapter we looked at the military ramifications of the Armistice. Here we will examine the aspects of the Armistice which shed light on the Germans’ ‘philosophy’ of occupation, and also those features that can broaden and deepen our understanding of what occupied France, in reality, was like. To sum up: what can the Armistice tell us about the nature of the Occupation?</p><p>It is clear, first, that the Occupation was a strategic measure. Article 2 of the Armistice makes this plain: it is not that France is being occupied for the sake of it, or for purposes of revenge, but rather, ‘to assure the protection of the interests of the German Reich’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> In this sense the Occupation was a tactic, one part of Hitler’s European master plan. The Armistice goes on to state, and define, the role of the occupier:</p><p>In those regions of France occupied by the Germans, the Reich is to exercise all the rights of an occupying power. The French Government undertakes to assist in all ways the carrying-out of orders made for the execution of these rights and to have them put into force with the help of the French administration.</p><p>Consequently, the French Government is immediately to notify the authorities and public services of the occupied territories that they will have to conform to the decisions of the German military commanders and to collaborate faithfully with them. The German Government will give to the French Government and to the central administrations all facilities for putting into force the administration from Paris of occupied and unoccupied territory.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a></p><p>This, as one can see, is an extremely clear statement of intent. As Simon intimates, ‘France’ was a worthless, hollow term after the Armistice.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a></p><p>The Armistice was not particularly specific about what the day-to-day reality of the Occupation would be. Perhaps only a quarter or so of the Armistice terms dealt directly with social and economic matters; the rest of the articles were avowedly military in substance. Nevertheless, the raft of non-military terms do go some way to substantiating the view that sees the Armistice as a particularly harsh, vindictive document. The key word is subservience. The French might have been hoping for some kind of partnership; but what they got, in the end, was a servant-master relationship.</p><p>This is most vividly illustrated in Article 18: ‘The cost of maintaining German troops in French territory falls on the French Government.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> This was blanket liability — France was to pick up the tab for the whole Occupation. Other significant duties were put the way of France (or what was left of it). It had to ‘assure across unoccupied territory the transit of goods between the German Empire and Italy to the extent required by the <b>[PAGE 8]</b> German Government’ and also to ‘undertake the repatriation of the population in the occupied regions’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a></p><p>There were thus obligations — and also restrictions. Article 17, for example, states that there must be no transport of ‘securities and food-stuffs’ from occupied territory into unoccupied areas; and further, that the French government<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a></b> will guarantee this. Likewise Article 14 stipulates that: ‘With regard to the French broadcasting stations, a restriction on transmitting will immediately be put into force.°’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> Not everything, though, was put down in black and white. The Germans, after all, had licence to do as they pleased, to make up the rules of the Occupation as they went along, and to dictate terms, continually, during the wartime period.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a></p><p><b>Reality</b></p><p>The reality of the post-Armistice situation was symbolised by the ‘line of demarcation’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> which separated occupied France in the north from unoccupied France in the south.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> It eventually disappeared, but this should be viewed as an indicator of <i>total</i> occupation rather than as any kind of German ‘concession’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> While it existed, the line remained a visible reminder of national division. Sweets comments:</p><p>The major crossing-point closest to Clermont-Ferrand was located at Moulins, north of Vichy. Before its suppression on 1 March 1943…this boundary was a major irritant to the French. Because their country was divided by closely watched internal frontiers, they were forced to communicate with friends, relatives, or business associates on regulation postcards and letters subject to German interception and censorship. During the first year of the Occupation, travel between the two zones was restricted severely by German authorities, and occasionally traffic was cut off entirely to pressure the French in negotiations concerning the application of the Armistice terms.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a></p><p>So ‘the line’ was a real-life symbol. And Paris — the capital of the occupied zone — was akin to a ‘vast German garrison town’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a></p><p>There are other important questions: What did the Occupation mean in practical terms? How did France, and ordinary French people, respond to the Nazi invasion? What was the nature of French-French, French-German and German-French relations during the wartime period?</p><p>Kedward paints an extremely vivid picture of the Occupation’s initial impact: Those returning in July to their homes in the occupied zone found all tricolour flags removed from public buildings and replaced by Nazi insignia, street directions in bold German type, a curfew imposed from eight o’clock in the evening to six in the morning, total absence of French cars and lorries, and groups of Germans everywhere buying lavishly in the re-opening shops, riding from one tourist site to another, staging endless parades and holding concerts in the local bandstands…. Shopkeepers had to accept the German currency and were obliged to serve Germans first, though not all German soldiers insisted on <b>[PAGE 9]</b> this.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a></p><p>In the crudest of terms, the Occupation can be characterised as an exercise in control and exploitation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> In this sense, there was massive, and acute, disruption; in another sense, French people just got on with their day-to-day lives and were unaffected. This is the paradox inherent in the Occupation: there was both change and continuity and, in the words of Nettelbeck, ‘disillusionment and illusions…abjection and hope’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> Most obviously, the Occupation had severe economic effects. Defrasne has described the Occupation as an ‘economic pillage’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> and in reality it would be difficult for anyone to disagree with this verdict. The bare bones are these: France’s index of industrial production fell from 100 in 1938 to 54 in 1941 and 33 in 1944; meanwhile the index for agricultural output fell away from 100 in 1938 to 69 in 1944.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a></p><p>France was exploited mercilessly for the good of the German war effort. The occupiers altered the whole <i>raison d’être</i> of the French economy for selfish reasons. Production, distribution and exchange were all affected. Cobban talks about the ‘Nazi exploitation of France’:</p><p><blockquote>This took many forms. Occupation costs were raised after the invasion of North Africa, from 300 to 500 million francs a day. The vast amount of credit which the German authorities accumulated in this way was used for the acquisition of raw materials and food stuffs, French securities and works of art, for payments to the dependants of French workers recruited for labour in Germany, and to finance all the civil and military services of the occupying power…. The Germans insisted on a policy of controlled wages and prices. This resulted in the growth of a vast and nation-wide black market, which the occupying authorities themselves tolerated and used with an appropriate rake-off ….nd the financial exploitation of France, which was largely a matter of book-keeping, there was the reality of systematically stripping France of raw materials, food stuffs, and manufactured products.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a></blockquote></p><p>As regards the everyday reality of the Occupation, there are a score of fascinating indicators. The figures below relate to Paris only:</p><p>

	</p><p>These statistics lead to one main conclusion: life in occupied France was expensive and often unhealthy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a></p><p>Food was a particularly crucial issue. In a time of war, and of Occupation, this was always going to be the case. Collins Weitz states:</p><p><blockquote>For most, food was <i>the</i> primary concern in France throughout the occupation. One can appreciate the impact of major food shortages in a country where meals are the focus of daily life. Bread and meat were rationed by the end of September 1940; other commodities were added to the list of rationed products shortly thereafter. Allocations — determined by age and activity — diminished during the occupation years. Simone de Beauvoir was among the many women for whom concerns about finding food became a major obsession during the war years: ‘I watched while the coupons were clipped from my rations books, and never parted with one too many. I wandered through the street rummaging …for unrationed food stuffs, a sort of treasure hunt, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a></blockquote></p><p>Sweets cites the example of Clermont-Ferrand. He quotes two local police officers: one speaking before the Germans moved into the south, another afterwards: The situation of numerous households, workers or lower civil servants has become truly precarious in the face of the unbroken rise in the cost of living…. The situation would be disastrous had there not been created happily at Clermont-Ferrand numerous workers’ gardens which are helping to overcome many difficulties …. For many products the black market has become the only market…. Potatoes are impossible to find. One never sees them in the regular markets because of the regulated prices that have been set…really much too <b>[PAGE 11]</b> low. What is abundant is sold at very high prices, what is rare is still higher.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> The working class…and in a general manner…those retired on modest incomes…are suffering more and more…. The basic necessities are being sold at higher and higher prices and will soon be entirely beyond their means.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a></p><p>Even in the south, the consequences of the Occupation were clear.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> More generally, the pressure of dislocation affected the very nature of the French economy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> There was barter, rationing and the emergence of an extensive black market.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> Agulhon states: The Germans were now physically present everywhere. Economic impositions aggravated the hardships. Everything was rationed, everything was in short supply, there were food ration cards, monthly allocations of ‘coupons’, ‘points’ to authorize the purchase of small quantities of goods of all kinds; official provisions, which were often mediocre, were sometimes lacking because the available stocks had vanished from the legal circuits to resurface on the black market.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a></p><p>One artist even sketched a drawing of women queuing for lipstick.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a></p><p>On another level there was the <i>service du travail obligatoire</i> (STO): a scheme which obliged France to send nationals to Germany to work for the Nazi regime. Initially France sent 250,000 men and women, including around 150,000 specialists; by 1944 the overall figure had risen to about 1,000,000.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> Cobban says that ‘by the autumn of 1943 it was estimated that French workers constituted one fourth of all foreign male workers in Germany’. In essence the STO was an economic diktat with which France had to comply. It had severe consequences; most obviously, the imbalance between German and French economies was enhanced. In social terms, it created a situation in which families and couples were broken up — often for good. It also forced people to make up their minds politically. As Agulhon states: ‘It imposed on several thousands of young people the clear choice between active collaboration by leaving for the STO, and active resistance, by refusing. It offered the maquis an unexpected and substantial recruitment pool.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a></p><p>In social terms, the Occupation had a wide array of ramifications. From the appearance of dark, bold German type on signposts and buildings to the reality of 11 p.m. curfews, the impact of the occupiers was ever-present. There were scores of German-French malefemale liaisons — a ‘crime’ for which many native women were to pay come the Liberation — and also, interestingly, a marked increase in the number of French people partial to wearing red, white and blue clothes. This ‘act’ was viewed as one of the most basic forms of resistance, and also as one of the most effective in terms of boosting French morale — in just the same way as the ‘act’ of giving inaccurate or misleading directions to German soldiers was. Far more sinister though were the notices which started to appear saying: ‘OUT OF BOUNDS TO JEWS’. Suddenly, French people had to make it their business to sign special declaration forms indicating that they were <i>not</i> Jews or freemasons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a></p><p>The dislocation implicit in war and the Occupation also had a range of significant demographic effects. Once again, these statistics relate to Paris only:</p><p>

	</p><p>These figures require some explanation. It is clear that the experience of war discouraged people from getting married. Similarly, the figures for births and deaths are completely understandable given the decrease in marriages and the loss of life that accompanies war. Most intriguing perhaps are the figures for suicides. Here it is argued that the experience of war — and the ultimate hope of liberation — stopped many people from taking their own life. According to this line of argument, war gave people something to live for; so, bizarrely, misery <i>before</i> the war encouraged more suicides than it did <i>during</i> the war. One positive effect to come out of the war was the decline in alcoholism. Rationing had at least one advantageous outcome.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a></p><p>In the sphere of communications the German presence was extremely evident. In addition to symbolic developments — all French clocks were set to German time, thus flummoxing and unnerving a good proportion of the indigenous population — the occupiers started to control and censor ‘French’ publications. <i>Le Matin</i>, for example, was one of the first newspapers to sell out (metaphorically rather than literally). Gradually, however, pro-German, pro-Nazi propaganda began to seep through the whole of the Paris-based media. Transport was also affected. The Germans requisitioned 4,000 out of <b>[PAGE 13]</b> a total of 17,000 locomotives and 294,000 wagons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> Metro stations were closed for large chunks of the wartime period and post and rail services were also seriously cut. The occupying forces constantly stated that the railways would resume normal operations, but in 1944 it was a fact that more than half of all rail traffic was German-orientated. And for various economic reasons, many people used bicycles instead of cars. As Ousby states: Though traffic had not vanished from the streets of Paris, the change was eerie to anyone who remembered the city before the war. An observer who conducted his own amateur survey toward the end of 1943 counted, during a ten-minute period near midday on the Place de la Bourse, just three cars, a motorbike and a horse-drawn cab.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a></p><p>The Occupation affected the normal daily routines of ordinary people; freedom of circulation was limited and an <i>Ausweis</i> — a special German pass or ‘internal passport’ — was needed for even the most basic of journeys within the northern zone (or between zones). This general lack of movement had interesting, and diverse, consequences: the number of car accidents decreased — less movement meant less cars and, thus, less accidents — and the life of rural inhabitants became increasingly isolated.</p><p>Likewise the German presence had not insignificant consequences for leisure.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> The occupiers tried to create an artificial life for themselves — at the races, theatre and so on — and this added to the strange and surreal atmosphere. Cinemas closed in the afternoon; they generally showed a subtle cocktail of French films and German news propaganda. Many onlookers also noted the fact that French nightclubs were packed with Germans — a feature of life that de Beauvoir, in particular, highlights.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a></p><p>The Occupation was also a period of massive, and profound, artistic creation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> One view is that the period 1943–44 was the richest-ever for art — especially in Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> The forces of the Resistance placed an especially high premium on the <i>political</i> power of art. However, many intellectuals allowed themselves to be compromised, and continued working in ‘Germanized’ Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> Artists such as Van Dongen, Vlaminck, Friez, Despiaux, Bouchard, Derain, Le Jeune and Belmondo have all been branded as ‘collaborators’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a></p><p>In addition, the Germans made significant efforts to promote themselves and their country. As Burrin writes:</p><p><blockquote>The so-called ‘educated’ public was…being targeted in other ways. It was presented with a prodigious collection of the most sophisticated products of German culture: a curious idea, it might be thought, at a time when the two countries were still in a state of war and the clash of arms was to be heard on all sides.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a></blockquote></p><p>Burrin suggests that the occupiers were particularly successful in promoting their music, their language, and — via a series of lectures at the German Institute — aspects of their history and way of life.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a></p><p>Politically, the occupied zone was a strange mix. The Germans and their representatives obviously held sway, but resistance groups were emerging throughout the wartime period. There was also an extra, unpredictable element: the Paris Nazis. These <b>[PAGE 14]</b> people — cranks and misfits for the most part — were based in the capital and although their real political significance was minimal, they were an interesting group: zealous admirers of the Nazi regime, and at the same time harsh critics of the Pétain administration. That said, the Germans looked upon them as lightweights. It is also true that some individuals moved <i>between</i> the Paris salons and the Vichy government. Politically, and geographically, therefore, the Paris-based fascists were caught between the two political centres. Agulhon states:</p><p><blockquote>The occupied zone had its own political situation, by all the evidence more sensitive to the war and therefore less vulnerable to the illusions of that free and almost normal France which Vichy would ‘doctor’ with its own ‘remedial treatment’. Above all, Paris was a pole of influence over which Vichy had hardly any hold.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a></blockquote></p><p>Underlying everything, however, was the experience of ordinary men and women. In the context of occupied France, however, there is no such thing as ‘women’s experience’ any more than there is ‘men’s experience’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> but even so it is clear that women, more than ever, became ‘involved’ in politics and in the making of political choices. They also suffered. Collins Weitz quotes Evelyne Sullerot on 1940:</p><p><blockquote>My mother was not with us when the Germans suddenly invaded France. She had gone to see my twenty-year-old brother who had been mobilised. Do you have any idea of what that means?… They came at night. We heard strange noises and voices. It was the Germans installing guns in our garden. So it was that one night I heard that language which I came to hate to such an extent that it is impossible to express. My grandmother (who knew German) told us, Those are the Germans.’ It was extraordinary. They entered our garden; just like that. They seemed to belong to another race. It was a Panzer division. The soldiers were very tall — almost six feet — and dressed entirely in black with skull-andcrossbones insignias.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a></blockquote></p><p>It could be argued, therefore, that women bore the brunt of the dislocation heralded by the Occupation and war. And, on the evidence of Sullerot’s words, their view of the German occupiers was typical of the French population as a whole.</p><p>We started this section by making reference to the ‘line of demarcation’ which split the northern zone from the southern zone and which inevitably came to symbolise national division. The Occupation has also attracted other depictions. Ousby emphasises the theme of darkness:</p><p><blockquote>Darkness, which would prove one of the most common practical inconveniences of the occupation, was also from the first its symbol. The late daybreak on winter mornings and the power cuts which robbed homes of light: these were not just irritations or hardships that soon grew commonplace. They were identified with the occupation on a quite elemental level. Darkness, or so people at first feared, was like the darkness which visited the people of Egypt in the Old Testament: a sign of divine disfavour, that the gods who had once smiled on <b>[PAGE 15]</b> the nation had now indefinitely withdrawn their protection.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a></blockquote></p><p>We should also be aware of other ways in which the Occupation has been characterised. In many poster images during and after the war, the Occupation was likened to slavery, submission and subservience. As such, France — German-controlled France — was portrayed as a vulnerable and enslaved woman.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> On the same kind of theme, the notion that France was ‘raped’ and ‘violated’ by the Occupation has gained currency.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> ‘Silence’ too has emerged as a pertinent metaphor for the Occupation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a></p><p><b>The German presence</b></p><p>Underlying all of this was the presence of the Germans. At its most brutal, the German presence meant significant police activity via the Gestapo.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> The Gestapo in France was made up of approximately 2,000 men and officials. For most of the time, and particularly in the hours of darkness, the Gestapo was feared; the presence of its officers made everyone anxious, and instantaneous arrests often accompanied its operations.</p><p>The presence of the Gestapo had its effect. In addition to arrests, the organisation was notorious for its hostage-taking (although this gradually declined) and its 24-hour-a-day torture chambers. The military tribunals manned and operated by the Gestapo were the most explicit indication of its philosophy. These ‘courts’ were ready to rubber-stamp summary executions for even the most mundane of ‘anti-German’ acts. For most of the time the French police worked together with the German police.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a></p><p>The Gestapo attempted to regulate the life of the occupied zone. It closed down the university in Paris as a retort to anti-German protests and, on an altogether more routine level, announced that French people had to cross roads at appointed places. Its activity in occupied France was influenced and conditioned by a variety of factors: the demands of Berlin, the political climate in Paris, the outlook of the military governor and ambassador, and also the course of the war outside France.</p><p>Throughout the Occupation period, the Franco-German dynamic was fascinating to observe. Here were two mighty nations engaging in a new type of relationship: partners in collaboration, with the victors on the battlefield dictating terms to the vanquished. Quite naturally, this new arrangement had all kinds of ramifications. On the whole, Germany viewed France as a weak and impotent nation, and the country’s military and diplomatic staff tended to view a posting to the occupied zone as a passport to an easy life, particularly when compared to the challenges, and dangers, of life on the eastern front.
	</p><p>For its part, France had a somewhat schizophrenic view of Germany and Germans. On the one hand, it was very easy for French people to depict Germany as a nation of Nazis. This attitude was common and understandable, hence the broad-ranging efforts at resistance — from the most organised to the most petty-minded and innocuous. Not unnaturally, there was also particular venom reserved for the Germans’ anti-Jewish policy. On the other hand though, and perhaps quite surprisingly, many French people came to realise that the ‘Nazi occupiers’ were ordinary, normal people after all. This comes out in many different spheres. In <i>The Silence of the Sea</i>, the main message seems to be that, however much the uncle and the niece want — and are expected — to hate their <b>[PAGE 16]</b> German lodger, they actually quite like him: he’s decent, cultured and friendly. At the end of the film, when the niece does eventually speak to the officer — she utters one word, ‘<i>Adieu</i>’ — it is symbolic of an extremely significant coming-together (perhaps even of a romantic nature).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> Similarly, in the writings of de Beauvoir, it is possible to see a grudging, and perhaps growing, respect for the Germans she encounters in her everyday life.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a></p><p>Of course, de Beauvoir hated the whole notion of the Occupation — calling it at one point, ‘absolutely hellish’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> — but she begins to admire the Germans’ kindness, politeness and general decency. For her, the fact that the Germans <i>were</i> so cheerful, while at the same time the French appeared so miserable, made the whole experience of the Occu pation so much worse. Sweets puts forward another perspective. He says that what existed was a kind of apartheid, with German officials and representatives of the French government receiving special treatment in all kinds of ways.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> That for him was the reality of the Occupation.</p><p>More than anything, the Germans’ presence had consequences for the northern zone’s Jewish population. As Agulhon states: ‘It was in Paris that the Jews caught the full force, and with the least chance of flight or protection, of the lash of Nazi anti-Semitism, marching towards the “final solution”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> Thus, from May 1942 onwards Jews in Paris were obliged to wear a yellow star to denote their identity. Round-ups followed.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> The irony was that early on in the war many Jews were totally unaware of the horrific fate that would eventually subsume them. Adler states: ‘It was physical survival that was at stake for the Jews of Paris during the Occupation yet few Jews realised this soon enough.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> In the end it was the Berlin decree of 1942 — ordering mass deportations — which forced them to open their eyes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a></p><p>The Occupation was, therefore, a terrible ordeal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> Ousby might argue that the Occupation was ‘unnatural’ and that ‘the Germans never belonged’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> but the bottom line was simple. As Collins Weitz puts it: Those in the occupied zone, where collaborationists were in charge, <i>had</i> to deal with the German presence.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a></p><p><b>Division</b></p><p>The main legacy of the Occupation was division. One can examine this on a variety of levels. Division had a very definite geographical basis. Not only did the perennial Paris/Provinces quarrel re-open, but the urban-rural split also returned to France. Sartre says in his writings that during the war, Parisians — by nature of the fact that they were living so close to ‘the enemy’ — were habitually accused of collaborating; southerners meanwhile were attacked by northerners for leading an easy, blasé, life (by 1942 though, when the Germans invaded the southern zone, this tension was, for obvious reasons, no longer evident).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a></p><p>The traditional urban-rural friction — always on display, even at the best of times — had a similar kind of tone: the urban areas felt that the countryside was starving the cities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> As Collins Weitz comments:</p><p><blockquote>City dwellers ‘rediscovered’ their country cousins. Reports from different <b>[PAGE 17]</b> regions reveal a growing contrast between rich and poor, between city dweller and peasant. Peasants were viewed as privileged, although this was hardly true for those with small holdings. City dwellers tended to believe the peasants received good prices for their crops and sold on the black market as well. While some did profit from the country’s predicament, other peasants generously helped the Resistance with food and shelter.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a></blockquote></p><p>Sweets also confirms that towns and cities in the southern zone, like Clermont-Ferrand, ‘bore less of the <i>direct</i> costs of defeat and Occupation than was the case for those French cities more exposed to large-scale military engagements and four years of total Occupation’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a> This should not come as too much of a surprise. Ousby concludes that: On the whole people fared better in rural areas than in great cities like Paris. In the countryside, people were better placed to produce for themselves, exchange with their neighbours, forage for food or fuel and, of course, to conceal produce from requisitioning.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a></p><p>The Occupation did nothing to bring different classes closer together. On the contrary, it created profound tensions. The working classes knew that they had suffered most during the 1939–40 conflict; they also knew that they had borne the brunt of the STO. As a result, they argued that some groups — most notably, the upper classes — had hardly been affected at all. As Ousby states:</p><p><blockquote>By the terrible logic of the occupation, the French who went hungry kept most of their anger for the French who ate well…. The have-nots, which meant most of the French, did not have to visit expensive restaurants to find…filthy rich to despise, such <i>arrivistes</i> to resent. They could find them in profiteering shopkeepers who, like the Poissonards, charged ridiculous prices or tried to fob them off with unsaleable goods.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a></blockquote></p><p>There was a similar split between generations. On the whole, the veterans of the First World War blamed the young for losing the war in 1940; the young retorted by saying that the writing had been on the wall since 1918 when the older generation had ‘lost’ the Versailles peace. It was mentioned earlier that, in an important sense, the Germans thrived on the division that, on a national scale, the Occupation brought. And, inadvertently, they also benefited from the many socio-economic divisions that the invasion and the reality of the Occupation crystallised.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a></p><p>In summing up, it is helpful to refer to a cartoon of a café scene in a wartime French newspaper. The image featured two people: a waiter and a customer. The dialogue was as follows:</p><p><blockquote>Customer: ‘The usual please, garçon.’ Waiter: The usual? The usual? There’s no such thing as the usual, sir.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a></blockquote></p><p>At the time the cartoon, and the words attached to it, may have had many and various political connotations, but one truth is obvious and self-evident: the Occupation changed <b>[PAGE 18]</b> everything. Sweets argues that north and south were affected alike: War and occupation meant hard times for almost everyone in France. Uncertain employment; shortages of food, clothing, and most consumer goods; restricted mobility; unwelcome regulations and controls from both German occupation authorities and their own government; and other problems contributed to the discontent of most French citizens.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a></p><p>In the end though the goal for most people was a simple one. Kedward states: The first expressions of anger in France were at best followed by mute incomprehension. In general the French turned further away from the war and concentrated single-mindedly on day-to-day survival and the search for some return to a semblance of acceptable normality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a></p><p>Liberation from the conflicts, tensions and divisions of the Occupation came in 1944. However, the ease with which these social, economic and political difficulties were overcome should not be exaggerated. Larkin highlights this point: ‘There was a sense in which everyone who had lived through the Occupation was vicariously under scrutiny. The attitude of the man in the street to Vichy and the Germans during the Occupation had been as much a matter of temperament as of class or political allegiance.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a></p>
