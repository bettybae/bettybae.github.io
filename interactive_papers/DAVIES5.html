	<p><b>[PAGE 62]</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Legacy</p><p>An era still alive</b></p><p><blockquote>What surprised me most was not the passionate reactions — even among historians — to everything written about the ‘dark years’ of the war but the <i>immediacy</i> of the period, its astonishing presentness, which at times rose to the level of obsession: witness the constant scandals, the endless invective and insult, the libel suits, and the many affairs that attracted the attention of all of France.<br><br>Henri Rousso on The Vichy syndrome’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></blockquote></p><p>It should come as no surprise to discover that the wartime period in France—dramatic, traumatic and painful—has had a profound effect on France’s national psyche in the post- Liberation period. We should not suppose that the legacy has been simple and straightforward. Rather, we should regard the legacy as a complex and multidimensional issue. It is a subject that continues to fascinate historians; for example, Gildea entitles Chapter 3 of his history of post-war France, ‘Echoes of the Occupation’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a></p><p>The Liberation was the most immediate, and obvious, legacy of the wartime period. The fact that the Liberation was not a specific event in 1944, but an ongoing process, adds to this contention. France was still being ‘liberated’ in 1945 and 1946 and, it could be argued, beyond. But if we are to move away from the specifics of the Liberation, we find a whole range of legacies.</p><p>Beevor and Cooper identify three main issues in the immediate post-war period. First, they highlight ‘the settling of accounts’ as a theme; there was still bitterness and antagonism in the post-war period—perhaps even more than there was during the Occupation. Second, they point to France’s sense of her own intellectual importance. As they state: ‘Almost immediately after the humiliation of the Occupation, and surrounded by the dilapidation and poverty of 1945, Paris rapidly managed to project its sense of cultural superiority.’ Third, they high-light France’s ‘love-hate relationship with the United States’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> We will allude to all these themes in the course of this chapter.</p><p>It is also apt to cite the words of Maurois. He says that at the end of the war, ‘the problems to be solved were vast’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> It is not surprising, therefore, that the legacy of the period was so all-embracing. Cottrell sums the situation up:</p><p><blockquote>It is impossible to overstate the confusion of feelings which Vichy, the war and the Occupation excite in France, even today. The simplified stories told by the small-town French war museums of evil German soldiers and heroic Resistance fighters are true enough. But so, too, are the more complicated stories of the complicities and collaborations of ordinary life, of Pétainism, of anti-Semitism, of the grey areas of wartime memory which can now be addressed to popular acclaim by films like <i>Uranus</i>, but which were for decades simply too painful for most people to touch.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a></blockquote></p><p>This last line is very poignant. Some specific aspects of the Occupation period remain ‘too painful for most people to touch’, but as we will discover, a new openness—of sorts—has emerged in recent years.</p><p>This chapter will be divided into two main sections. The first will explore the immediate legacy of the Occupation. The second section will take a broader view and assess the issue of legacy in the long term. It will become clear that in a whole range of spheres the wartime period is still very much alive.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> Morris sums up the situation: <blockquote>Of all the various fashions which have preoccupied the French over the last two decades or so, perhaps the most evident and most sustained has been the allembracing ‘<i>mode rétro</i>’, that remarkable renewal of interest in, and extensive reevaluation of, the wartime occupation of France by Adolf Hitler’s Germany.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a></blockquote></p><p>It should also be noted that many of the issues dealt with in the previous chapter are still relevant here. ‘Liberation’ and ‘legacy’ are, in a sense, related topic areas. Thus, we explored the significance of <i>l’Épuration</i> in Chapter 4, but we must acknowledge that the need for scapegoats was an ongoing one and continued into the post-war period. Similarly, we will deal with the subject of reconstruction in this chapter; but we need to be aware that the emphasis on post-war economic development was laid as soon as the war had finished and was a crucially important feature of the Liberation.</p><p><b>The immediate post-war years</b></p><p>Lottman might argue that the writers and intellectuals of the Left Bank enjoyed a postwar celebration that ‘seemed to last for years’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> but the reality of the situation for most ordinary people was confusion, uncertainty, division and ‘disarray’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> Williams puts things into perspective:</p><p><blockquote>The war shook France out of the economic stagnation and political paralysis which had marked the last years of the Third Republic. Defeat provided the opportunity for a counter-revolution, directed not only against the working-class movement, but also against the democratic regime itself. The Resistance was a revolutionary response to this challenge, and its triumph produced an entirely new political situation. But the new-found national unity was quickly dissipated. The Communist drive for power forced all groups to take sides. During 1945 and 1946 there proceeded simultaneously a national effort at indispensable economic reconstruction, and a bitter ‘cold war’ between the ruling parties, which dominated the contemporaneous attempts to frame a new constitution. When the Communists went out of office in May 1947, the regime gradually <b>[PAGE 64]</b> returned to normal, and the political practices of the past slowly revived.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a></blockquote></p><p>The post-war period was never going to be easy, in economic or political terms. In particular, the need to ‘cleanse’ France after the horrors of collaboration was always liable to cause disruption—and this it did. There were widespread summary executions—in addition to the government-sanctioned ones—and, in places, a situation approaching anarchy. The fact that Laval and a small group of other key collaborators were executed in the immediate aftermath of the war is indicative of the attitude of the post-war regime. It is easy to exaggerate the extent of post-war dislocation. Cobban, for one, is aware of this; he claims that the speed with which France returned to normal and peaceful conditions after the war was far more impressive than is usually acknowledged.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> This point should be borne in mind as we move on.</p><p>It is clear nevertheless that the competing claims of the various resistance groups helped to create a post-war climate which bordered on the frenzied. Everyone was manoeuvring for power and influence in the weeks and months following the Liberation—and not everyone was going to be satisfied. The Germans had been expelled from France but there was still significant tension between the communists’ desire ‘to impose a revolutionary view of the Liberation’ and de Gaulle’s powerful belief in the hegemony of ‘established channels of law and order and state power’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> Gildea depicts this conflict as a battle between ‘hardliners and soft-pedallers that was almost as important as that between those who won and those who lost by the act of Liberation.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a></p><p>This intra-resistance squabbling was not the only type of division—merely the most obvious. There was also the ever-present friction between ex-collaborators and exresisters and, less predictably, a serious divide among those who said they supported the new Fourth Republic. Cobban might argue that there were some elements of stability— like, for example, the <i>Quai d’Orsay</i>—but the overwhelming reality was that France was a society and a political entity torn into pieces.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> It was de Gaulle who emerged as the leader of the nation, but in a precarious fashion. As Williams states: ‘The rival government of General de Gaulle established itself at Algiers in 1943. It gradually obtained the recognition of the Allied powers, and took control in France in 1944. But until 21 October 1945 its authority was based on no formal or legal title.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> By 1946 de Gaulle’s administration had been replaced.</p><p>It is difficult to underestimate the scale of the devastation suffered by France during the wartime years. A few statistics indicate the economic decline: a quarter of the nation’s wealth was destroyed, industrial production in 1944 was only 38 per cent of the 1938 level; only half the nation’s rail track survived the war, only a fifth of the country’s lorries remained; in 1945 only two-thirds of French coal stocks were left, and half a million buildings were destroyed in the conflict.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> In the aftermath of war, a ‘Ministry of Reconstruction’ was created, urbanisation quickened, and a population drift to the towns began.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> It would cost France almost five million francs to return to normality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a></p><p>In time, long-range planning became <i>de rigeur</i>. The aim was ‘<i>une économie concertée</i>’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> and France set out on the road to reconstruction with a ferocious appetite. The results were impressive:<b>[PAGE 65]</b></p><p><i>GNP (billions of US dollars)</i><br><br>1948 16.3<br><br>1958 57.2<br><br><i>GNP (per capita—US dollars)</i><br><br>1948 387<br><br>1958 1,257<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a><br><br></p><p>France’s post-war economic ‘plan’ was launched in January 1947, and in time Jean Monnet would add a European dimension to this national ‘relaunch’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Well into the post-war period, the constant preoccupation of France’s political leaders was reconstruction. This could be seen in the policy emphases of the first post-war governments, in the language and rhetoric used by political leaders, and in the posters and propaganda advanced by the infant Fourth Republic. In time, the prioritisation of economic development and reconstruction by the post-war authorities had its own consequences: most significantly, an increased demand for immigrant labour.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a></p><p>In the social sphere there were important developments—not least the granting of voting rights to women in 1946. However, as Collins Weitz argues, we should not assume that there was a definite ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ at play here. She insists that ‘votes for women’ was a pragmatic policy and not simply a ‘reward’. She goes on to say that women’s lives <i>were</i> changed and affected by the wartime experience, but not <i>just</i> by the award of suffrage rights.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a></p><p>One of the most interesting, and understated, legacies of the Occupation period relates to foreign policy. Here we see two things happening. First, it is clear that de Gaulle’s foreign policy position changed very little between the 1940s and the 1970s. The principles he adhered to at the start of the war were still conditioning his diplomatic attitude well into the post-war period. Jackson pinpoints two in particular: the belief that the nation state was a fundamental reality and, thus, that supra-nationality was a ‘bad thing’; and the conviction that the independence of France was a prerequisite for national grandeur.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> There were also similarities in the positions in which de Gaulle found himself: ‘In 1958, as in 1944, de Gaulle’s priority was to restore the activity of the state against the very forces which had helped him to power: in 1944 the Resistance, in 1958 the Algerian rebels.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a></p><p>In another sense, it is clear that the Occupation period conditioned the nature, and main thrust, of de Gaulle’s post-war foreign policy. There was always a need to ‘keep in the ranks of the Great Powers’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> However, de Gaulle’s wartime experience—and his frosty relationship with Britain and the USA—made him believe that France should broaden her horizons as regards allies in the post-war period. Thus, even though organs like <i>Le Monde</i> made the case for a ‘neutralist’ foreign policy,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> de Gaulle steered France towards the USSR and the Third World and away from Britain and the USA.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a></p><p>In many ways this was a logical policy and in line with public opinion, for the 1940s and 1950s were years of severe strain in Franco-American relations. Clearly, de Gaulle’s <b>[PAGE 66]</b> wartime disagreements with Roosevelt were an early sign of friction. In the immediate post-war years—even though France remained heavily dependent on the USA<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a>—the relationship soured even more. In trade, culture and diplomacy there were conflicts and a general feeling of unease. As Kuisel puts it:</p><p><blockquote>Newsreels have captured for posterity the image of joyous crowds celebrating with GIs as Allied troops marched across the country in the summer of 1944. But liberation by outsiders only verified France’s fall from grace. France had lost and America had gained in rank. This was the key political-psychological ‘fact’ of the early postwar era. Injured national pride, unacknowledged but real, filled the underground spring that fed anti-Americanism. A France already torn by internal division, humiliated by defeat, occupation and collaboration, and slightly embarrassed by its liberation faced a crisis of national identity. The cultural revulsion against America, as one historian argues, may have been a kind of ‘compensatory defence reflex’ by which the liberated excommunicated the liberators.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a></blockquote></p><p>It should be noted that this in-bred anti-Americanism has lasted into the twenty-first century—particularly on the right and the far right.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a></p><p>In the short term, however, the key legacy of the wartime period was another change of regime. The Third Republic had collapsed amid military defeat in June 1940; the Vichy administration had lost what limited power it did possess with the German invasion of the southern zone in 1942 (and imploded totally two years later); and in 1946 a series of constitutional arrangements were made to signify the establishment of the Fourth Republic.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> The new republican regime was, ironically, extremely similar to the old one. Cobban claims that the 1946 constitution was ‘closer to that of the Third Republic than the first draft had been…The demise of the Third Republic may have been voted: its successor was to follow so closely in its steps that the observer might well feel that it had merely changed to remain the same thing.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a></p><p>In reality the new Republic did not do enough for enough people. De Gaulle felt it was too parliament-dominated, so he retreated, and went swiftly into exile.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> The communists—even though they held power ‘for nearly three years after liberation’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a>— felt that their goal of revolution was still a million miles away. Cobban estimates that the new Republic could rely on the support of barely half the nation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> It suffered because of this and within 14 years the Fifth Republic had been established. This demonstrated that France’s perennial problems—constant political division and instability, and a profound inability to agree upon the ‘right regime’—were still present, as they had been throughout the period 1789–1944.</p><p><b>Right and left</b></p><p>The confrontations and politicking of the Occupation period had significant consequences for the post-war era. Hewlett goes so far as to say that the political history of France ‘continued to be particularly turbulent after the Second World War and the first 25 years after the war were in some ways more conflictual than the years 1900–39’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> His thesis is <b>[PAGE 67]</b> that whereas consensus politics prevailed in post-war Britain, Sweden and Germany, in France there was ‘conflictual politics’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> Thus, right and left were still very much alive.</p><p>Whatever the qualifications and caveats—and many of course can be made—it is clear that de Gaulle and his associates emerged triumphant from the wartime years. As a consequence—and notwith-standing the odd setback—they came to dominate the politics of the three decades following liberation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> The Gaullist parties of the post-war period were to exploit the role of the General to the full and glorify him as saviour and liberator.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a></p><p>For the extreme right—which must be clearly differentiated from the Gaullist right— the war and its aftermath meant temporary extinction. As Rémond has stated: In 1945 the hour finally seemed to have arrived when ‘the End’ could be written to the history of the Right. Everything was conspiring against it. Personnel suddenly was lacking. Its leaders were struck down: several were dead and others had let themselves be compromised with Vichy. All members of parliament who had voted full powers to Marshal Pétain on July 10, 1940—and that included all of the Right Wing—were ousted from political life. Even those whose conduct had been irreproachable did not wholly escape suspicion and were required to justify their conduct, as if simply belonging to the Right was disreputable.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a></p><p>Cheles <i>et al</i>. argue that the ‘collapse of the Vichy regime drove the extreme right underground. In fact the right seemed to have vanished altogether.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> The post-war years brought doom and depression for the ‘stigmatised’ right and extreme right.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> What credibility it had retained in 1940 was totally smashed by 1944. The execution of Laval and the imprisonment of Pétain were symbolic moments: the right had finally been castigated. As a result, in the years following the war—what Winock calls, ‘two very gloomy decades’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>—the right went into serious regression. Movements went undergound and political parties suffered at the hands of a vengeful and overtly anti-rightist electorate. Indeed, as Winock shows, the immediate post-war performance of the far right was pathetic—gaining only 1.5 per cent of the popular vote in the Legislative elections of June 1951.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a></p><p>It is Milza, however, who notes that by 1960 ‘neo-fascism’ was benefiting from the conjunction of three favourable factors: ‘the survival, during the vicissitudes of the immediate post-war, of collaborationist fascism, the acceleration in the pace of economic change, and lost colonial wars’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> Indeed, all these factors played a part. However, it was with the Algerian War of 1954–62—and the new traumas that this inflicted on France— that the right gained its first significant opportunity to regroup and reform. This was done spectacularly through the <i>Algérie Française</i> movement. This political grouping was dominated by hardcore nationalists who demonstrated a powerful, diehard belief in the ‘Frenchness’ of Algeria and opposed all moves designed to give Algeria more independence—especially those initiated after 1958 by the new President, de Gaulle. On the mainland it was a movement of extremists and fascists—including Jean-Marie Le Pen—while in North Africa it was dominated by army personnel and French settlers (<i>pieds noirs</i>). The <i>pro-Algérie Française </i>attitude was fuelled by ‘memories of de <b>[PAGE 68]</b> Gaulle’s refusal to grant a pardon to the geriatric Marshal Pétain (who died in gaol in 1951), and was prompted by his “betrayal of the army’s trust” in having negototiated with the FLN’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> Sores still ran deep and de Gaulle—in the eyes of some—was now connected with <i>two</i> shameful episodes in twentieth-century French history. The right, though, was back in business. Winock uses the phrase ‘<i>des clandestins aux activistes</i>’ to describe this re-emergence.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a></p><p>The Poujadist outburst of the late-1950s was also, in some ways, a legacy of the wartime period. Pierre Poujade, a small-town stationer established a movement to speak for, and to look after the interests of, French shopkeepers. The movement gained 53 seats in the 1956 legislative elections and frightened many people into thinking that Poujade— a man likened in the national press to Hitler—could topple the Republic. In the end this never happened, and in retrospect was never likely to happen. For us, though, the significance of Poujadism lies in its origins. In that Poujade’s <i>Union de Défense des Commerçants et Artisans</i> (UDCA) movement included a number of ex-Vichyites eager to return to political action, it could be viewed as a key moment in the history of post-war France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> More importantly perhaps, Poujadism can be interpreted as a <i>cri de coeur</i> on behalf of all those people affected in an adverse way by post-war reconstruction and modernisation. Poujadism was thus a notable, if indirect, legacy of the wartime years. The fact that the UDCA and the <i>Algérie Française</i> movement were born almost simultaneously suggests that after a short and painful interval—when it was licking its wounds—the right was back. This was a big surprise. Rémond says that in the immediate post-war years:</p><p>Many did not hesitate to announce the definitive end of the right as a political force and even as an ideology. Ten years later it was possible for Marcel Merle to write, ‘Weighing everything carefully, perhaps the most important political phenomenon of the regime’s (Fourth Republic’s) history was this reconstitution of a Right that everyone, hopefully, or scornfully, had agreed to condemn.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> In time—and as a result of wholesale amnesties<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a>—former Vichy loyalists came to dominate the movements, parties and groups on the post-war right. <i>Algérie Française</i>, Poujadism, <i>Jeune Nation</i> and, much later, the <i>Front National</i> all provided a home for ex- Vichyites and excollaborators.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> In time too, the ideas of Vichy were to resurface in the programme and ideology of some of these groupings. In 1969 Rémond summed up the legacy of the Pétain regime:</p><p>The importance of the Vichy episode in the history of the Right Wing demonstrates that the historic significance of events is not necessarily proportionate to their duration. Although the Vichy regime lasted only four years and the Liberation caused the disappearance of both its personnel and its institutions, the National Revolution nevertheless had important consequences for the destinies of the Right. It revealed the permanence of aspirations and ways of thinking that were believed outworn by the longevity of the Third Republic; it incarnated a hope of the Right. It left memories and regrets which even today are not completely dead: currently one faction of the extreme Right Wing can be distinguished by its loyalty to the government of Marshal Pétain <b>[PAGE 69]</b> and its unquenchable faith in the legitimacy of the French State as the basis for its anti-Gaullism. Above all, the public’s identification of the Right with the unhappy Vichy experiment discredited this faction for a long time. It dealt a blow that may be fatal to one form of extreme Right Wing nationalism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> This interim verdict was perhaps premature. The rise and consolidation of the <i>Front National</i> as a well supported political party in the 1980s and 1990s proved that the ideas of the nationalist right still had a constituency.</p><p>Whereas the right suffered post-war, the left blossomed. Indeed, the new parties of the left were to become instrumental in the shaping of the new France. Not only this but the main political groupings on the left have invariably looked back on the period of the Resistance as a formative one, as one of heroic action and brilliant symbolism. Today’s Communist Party in particular has made great play of its role in the Resistance. This may be justified, but one cannot help feeling that its declining popularity in the 1980s and 1990s made nostalgia for the Occupation period a pragmatic necessity.</p><p>Most potently perhaps, there is Pétain’s legacy. In the decades following the Liberation, he was to provoke both hatred and idolatry. It started with his trial and his imprisonment, and burgeoned from there. Griffiths explains the origins of the Pétain cult:</p><p><blockquote>Pétain was not a criminal. He was a man who, through vanity and a misunderstanding of events, had led his country into the wrong paths…On 15 August he was condemned to death; though on account of his great age, the Court asked that the verdict should not be executed. For the next six years, until his death on 23 July 1951, he was kept in prison on the Île d’Yeu, deteriorating both mentally and physically. The inhumanity of the imprisonment of this old and senile man, from the age of 89 to 95, will go down in history as one of the examples of the barbarity of our age. It has also served to add to the pious hagiology which now, for many, surrounds the figure of the Marshal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a></blockquote></p><p>In the post-war years, Pétain’s credibility as a patriotic national figure would decline sharply; but his memory would be powerful enough to provoke hardline followers into establishing special pro-Pétain movements and organisations. Anderson mentions the significance of the <i>Association pour Défendre la Mémoire du Maréchal Pétain</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a> He says that it was difficult for most ex-Vichyites to regain power and influence in the late-1940s and 1950s, so most settled for unadulterated nostalgia: one key demand was for the body of the Marshal to be transferred to Douaumont ‘to lie among those who had fallen at Verdun in 1917’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a></p><p>Whatever the fortunes of left and right, we should not forget that the immediate postwar era was also a period of <i>tripartisme</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> This phenomenon—the rule of the three main parties (the MRP, the PCF and the <i>Section Française de l’Internationale Ouvrière </i>[SFIO]) in coalition—was a unique development. The philosophy that lay behind it could be traced back to the war, its immediate aftermath and the general feeling that France and its politicians should act in a more mature, sensible and consensual manner. Although the experiment of <i>tripartisme </i>lasted only until 1947, it should be viewed as an important legacy of the wartime period.<b>[PAGE 70]</b></p><p><b>Myth against myth</b></p><p>In the long term, the legacy of Vichy has been just as powerful as that of the Resistance. It has been an era—and an <i>issue</i>—that France, as a nation, has struggled to cope with. More than that, it has become a taboo subject that very few people have wanted to discuss.</p><p>For three decades or more, Vichy was a topic that ordinary people did not talk about in respectable company. Even less did governments make statements about it. This was partly through guilt (the country was ashamed) and partly through common sense (the leaders of post-war France had a significant interest in fostering ‘unity’, however artificial). De Gaulle made strenuous efforts to bolster the view that wartime France was a nation of resisters and that France, alone, had been responsible for her own liberation: Paris! Paris humiliated! Paris broken! Paris martyrised! But Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, by its own people with the help of the armies of France, with the support and aid of France as a whole, of fighting France, of the only France, of the true France, of eternal France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a></p><p>As Rousso implies, de Gaulle at this point was fantasising about France’s role in the Liberation. He was exaggerating the role of Paris and France, underplaying the contribution of the Allies, and papering over the cracks of post-war division and disunity. Judt claims that ‘it suited almost everyone to believe that all but a tiny minority of the French people were in the Resistance or sympathised with it. Communists, Gaullists, and Vichyists alike had an interest in forwarding this claim.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> It was de Gaulle though who had most to gain from introducing this ‘resistancialist myth’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a></p><p>De Gaulle’s task, however, was a tricky one. He wanted to emphasise the idea that France liberated herself, but he did not want to glorify any one resistance organisation lest he entangle himself in intraresistance disputes or appear too overtly as wanting to rewrite history.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> Thus, as Rousso points out, the myth that emerged celebrated ‘a people <i>in resistance</i>, a people symbolised exclusively by the “man of June Eighteenth” [de Gaulle], without intermediaries such as political parties, movements or clandestine leaders’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> Judt agrees with this general line of analysis:</p><p>The initial postwar myth claimed that although the fighting Resistance may have been a minority, it was supported and assisted by ‘the mass of the nation’, united in its desire for a German defeat …In order to put Vichy behind… postwar France resorted to a strange self-induced amnesia, strange in that it took place in broad daylight, so to speak, and in the face of common knowledge of the truth. At one and the same time, France undertook to purge itself of the most obvious collaborators, while putting behind it the memory of the indifference or ambivalence of the majority.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a></p><p>In all of this France seemed to be deluding herself. McMillan helps to put things in perspective. He estimates the number of resistance activists and concludes: ‘At best… <b>[PAGE 71]</b> only a maximum of 2 per cent of the French adult population can be deemed to have been “in the Resistance”—a figure strikingly at odds with the myth of <i>la France résistante</i> developed at the Liberation.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a></p><p>Already, therefore, we see doubt being cast on the notion of France as a ‘nation of resisters’. This is no real surprise, for it was, first and foremost, a tactic or strategy—a point that de Gaulle came close to acknowledging on occasions. Larkin tends to concur: ‘For the nation’s own morale, and in order to present a united French front to other countries, the internal split between the former supporters of Vichy and the Resistance had to be healed.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> The same point is made by McMillan:</p><p><blockquote>The Resistance was important as an enormous boost to French morale…In permitting Frenchmen to have some share not only in their own liberation but in setting the whole of Europe free from the Nazi yoke, it gave back to a great nation its sense of dignity and pride.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a></blockquote></p><p>So, in many different ways the Resistance ‘myth’ served several useful purposes: it bound a nation together, it helped de Gaulle politically, and it made French people—<i>all</i> French people—feel good about them-selves (at least for a short period). And whether we call it ‘the Gaullist resistancialist myth’, ‘the myth of <i>la France résistante</i>’, or merely ‘the Resistance myth’, we are talking about the same useful construct.</p><p>The decades after 1945, however, witnessed a number of developments that jeopardised the continued existence of the myth. Rousso argues that the revolution of 1968 made many people view the past in a different light and the accession of Pompidou to the presidency brought to power a man with an open scepticism about the nature and reality of the French Resistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> However, it was the release of the film, <i>The Sorrow and the Pity</i>, that was to be the most explosive event. As Webster has written: ‘Marcel (Ophuls) took personal revenge on Vichy with a 1971 film…revealing the extent of antisemitism in Vichy’s chief satellite town, Clermont-Ferrand.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> This documentary, which was particularly vivid and honest in its analysis, gave a lie to the myth which had grown up since 1944 and which said that France was ‘a nation of resisters’. The film’s strategy was to ‘out’ collaborators and to leave ordinary French people—those who had been born after the war—in no doubt as to the reality of the politics, and political choices, in wartime France. The appearance of Rousso’s book, <i>The Vichy Syndrome</i>, in 1987 also made people reflect: if France was so ‘innocent’—as the Gaullist myth inferred—why did nobody really want to discuss, or even acknowledge, the Vichy years?</p><p><b>The Mitterrand era</b></p><p>The dawn of the Mitterrand presidency in 1981 gave free rein to new ‘revisionist’ attitudes. The socialist president began to make keynote pronouncements on the Vichy period and, more significantly, the authorities made tentative plans for a round-up of suspected ‘war criminals’. Over a decade or so—a period that spanned the 1980s and the 1990s—three of the most famous French collaborators were put on trial: René Bousquet, Paul Touvier and, most recently, Maurice Papon. This created a quite distinct climate in France. One commentator has talked about ‘the renewed desire to punish people for war <b>[PAGE 72]</b> crimes 45 years after the end of the war’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> another has spoken of ‘the purge today’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a></p><p>The Bousquet affair began in 1949 when he was sentenced to a three-year jail term for his actions during the war. It was in 1978, however, that the full extent of his wartime record was discovered. A decision to try him again, on charges of ‘crimes against humanity’, was made in 1990. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> commented on France’s new openness:</p><p><blockquote>Something has gone wrong in the French mechanism for ensuring that some of the very dirty laundry left over from the Nazi occupation does not get a public washing. Against strong official urgings, a Paris court decided last week that the case of the former Vichy police chief René Bousquet should not be sent up a legal blind alley.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a></blockquote></p><p>This passage hints at something quite profound: a fresh determination to unearth as much of the Vichy story as possible, whatever the consequences or ramifications. Most onlookers would view this as a positive development. The Bousquet saga was symptomatic of something far bigger. In 1942 Bousquet had been appointed Minister of the Interior in the Vichy government. The accusations against him involved not just one man, but a whole system of government. As Cottrell wrote at the height of the controversy: ‘Bousquet represents…the last chance to put the Vichy regime on trial for the worst of its crimes.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a></p><p>It is clear from the headlines that accompanied the Bousquet case that a regime was being judged: ‘A FIGHT TO PUT WARTIME NIGHT-MARES TO REST’, ‘WAR CRIMES TRIAL OPENS OLD WOUNDS’, ANXIOUS TIMES FOR THOSE WITH DIRTY WAR LAUNDRY’ and ‘JUDGEMENT ON VICHY’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> However, although the country was strongly determined to come to terms with its wartime ‘demons’, there is also some evidence to suggest that it did not want the exposure to go too far. Cottrell, for instance, has argued that the French establishment was initially very keen to keep the Bousquet case away from the courts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> Similarly, it is claimed that the Elysée was not pleased to learn that the Bousquet case was to be reopened.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> That said, the indications are that Mitterrand displayed both an enlightened attitude and a new openness towards the concept of war trials in the 1980s and the early 1990s.</p><p>The case of Paul Touvier was not dissimilar to that of Bousquet. The <i>Independent</i> reported in May 1989:</p><p><blockquote>After 45 years on the run, Paul Touvier, a French war criminal, has been tracked down and arrested in a traditionalist Catholic priory in the centre of Nice. His arrest brings to an end one of the longest manhunts in French history. Touvier headed the militia which helped Nazi occupation forces track down resistance fighters. Police believe he worked closely with the Gestapo chief, Klaus Barbie, who was jailed for life in France in 1987 for war crimes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a></blockquote></p><p>The fact that Touvier was arrested for ‘crimes against humanity’ was the main aspect of the story. For us, however, the Touvier case reveals other significant things about the legacy of the Vichy period. First, it is clear that some individuals in modern-day France do not support an anti-Vichy ‘witch-hunt’. For example, <i>Front National</i> leader Jean-<b>[PAGE 73]</b> Marie Le Pen responded to the capture of Touvier by saying: The police must have plenty of time on their hands if they can hunt down such a feeble old man.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> Le Pen is one person who would like to lay Vichy’s ghost to rest, perhaps for personal reasons.</p><p>For Patrick Marnham the key aspect of the situation was that Touvier could not hope to receive a fair trial. He refers to the ‘doubts as to whether it was possible to try a man for crimes in which most witnesses and victims were long since dead. It also raised the possibility that the charges against Mr Touvier had been brought out of loathing for the deeds he is accused of rather than out of any satisfactory evidence.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> Here again we see the legacy of the wartime period in all its vividness; there has been so much polemic that it is hard to separate the fantasy from the fact.</p><p>In the aftermath of Touvier’s arrest, a national opinion poll revealed that 37 per cent of French people thought it ‘normal’ that a religious order should have protected him.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> Was this a statement about the role of the Catholic Church in contemporary France? Did the poll finding indicate that a significant minority of the French population wanted Touvier to escape the police? Did people want to see an end to the escalating legacy of the war? Whatever the exact significance of the survey, it is clear that the Touvier case was still provoking controversy.</p><p>These cases are interesting, but we should not lose sight of their real importance. They show how the legacy of the wartime years lives on; the extent to which France has had to consider the question of what is, and is not, a ‘war crime’ or a ‘crime against humanity’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> and, also, how acutely aware of its responsibility to dispense real justice the French nation now is. President Georges Pompidou, who officially pardoned Touvier for his wartime activity, attempted to put the issue into perspective:</p><p><blockquote>For more than 30 years our country has suffered one national crisis after another. There was the 1939 War and the humiliations of defeat; the horrors of the Occupation, and the excesses of the purge which followed the Liberation. Then there was the war in Indo-China and the terrible conflict in Algeria which led to the forcible displacement of a million Frenchmen who were chased out of their homes…I myself was denounced to the Gestapo by the Vichy government and have since survived two assassination attempts. So I think I have the right to ask, are we going to keep our national wounds bleeding for ever? Hasn’t the time come to let the curtain fall and forget those days when the French loved each other so little that they tried to kill each other?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a></blockquote></p><p>Pompidou made this comment in 1971. Since then a new millennium has dawned, but the question he raised has still to be resolved.</p><p>Klaus Barbie, a German agent based in France, and Maurice Papon were also put through the same imperfect process as Bousquet and Touvier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> On the whole, France’s ‘war trials’ have been followed eagerly by the media and the general public alike. They have also been instrumental in restoring—if only in part—France’s integrity and credibility with regard to accepting, and acknowledging, her wartime experience.</p><p>We should, however, strike a note of caution here. As Webster writes: Although public interest in Vichy’s complicity in the murder of thousands of Jews has increased since the trial of Klaus Barbie in 1987, there is still a large <b>[PAGE 74]</b> measure of indifference shown by local and central governments. Most concentration camp sites have disappeared altogether and where there are commemorative signs the emphasis is always on Nazi cruelty with no mention of French complicity. The official protection as a classified monument given to the German concentration camp and gas chamber at Natzweiler-Struthof can be compared to the neglect at one of the most notorious Free Zone camps at Gurs in the Pyrenees.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a></p><p>The irony of the whole situation was that Mitterrand—the man who had done so much to open up the Vichy era to scrutiny—was accused of having skeletons in his own cupboard. The whispers about Mitterrand’s past had emerged intermittently during his presidency (1981–95), but reached fever-pitch in 1994, on the publication of Pierre Péan’s book on Mitterrand’s early political development, and in January 1996, after his death.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a> The veteran socialist politician was accused of many things: working for Vichy, receiving its patronage, honouring Pétain, aiding officials of the wartime government who attempted to avoid arrest, and maintaining a longstanding friendship with Bousquet.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> As Friend has argued: ‘Mitterrand carefully retouched the history of his early youth in the Vichy period.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> Commentators were extremely dubious about Mitterrand’s activities when they came to weigh up his life:</p><p><blockquote>Not until the last years of François Mitterrand’s life did the spectre of Vichy and his hitherto obscured role in the French collaborationist government cast a long dark shadow over his career… The row that erupted over his Vichy past may have surprised M Mitterrand. He did not believe in moral absolutes and insisted life was never a question of black and white but, in his own words, ‘light grey and dark grey’. If that were so, M Mitterrand’s Vichy years were still among the darkest shades of grey.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a></blockquote></p><p>After the Third Republic’s fiasco, the Pétainist interlude and the shambles of the Fourth Republic, the absence of self-confidence was Mitterrand’s opportunity. Evidently here was a broker and a juggler by instinct, a man who could find his way through, and satisfy all parties by identifying with none exclusively. It was more than a symbol that he used to pay pilgrimages to the grave of the disgraced Pétain and that he maintained his friendship with exploded collaborators of the stamp of René Bousquet, the Paris chief of police who signed the accord placing the <i>gendarmerie</i> at the orders of the Nazis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> What was remarkable was that the ageing Mitterrand seemed completely at ease with friends he had made in the 1930s and remained unflinchingly loyal to them. The President admitted quite happily to one of his biographers, Pierre Péan, that his circle included members of the Vichy-era interior ministry responsible for rounding up and deporting thousands of Jews…As President he never officially apologised for the crimes of Vichy, and…continued to send a wreath to the tomb of Marshal Pétain on the Île d’Yeu.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a></p><p>It is not surprising, therefore, that Cole sums up Mitterrand’s wartime record in the three words, ‘courage’, ‘captivity’ and ‘ambiguity’, and Laughland describes the former president’s relationship with Vichy as ‘intriguing’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a> <b>[PAGE 75] </b></p><p>The legacy of the Occupation period is a profound one. Even though, in time, Mitterrand joined the Resistance and moved to the left,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a> his association with the Vichy regime has been stigmatised by onlookers—as if identification with the administration, in itself, equates to some kind of horrible crime. That, to be sure, is the power of the wartime period.</p><p><b>France today</b></p><p>The war years have left their imprint on modern-day France. It is pertinent to analyse the manner in which France has coped, or failed to cope, with the memory of collaboration and resistance and full-scale civil war. Burrin has written:</p><p>The years of occupation indubitably left a painful splinter lodged in the memories of French people; for a cherished image of France was damaged by all the compromising deals struck with one of the worst regimes of modern Europe. The experience of the Second World War overturned the glorious image of the Great War, which had not only ended in victory, but had also produced a sacred unity in times of tribulation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a></p><p>And we should not be deceived: the wartime period is still an issue at the beginning of the third millennium.</p><p>For a start there is a political party, the <i>Front National</i>, which is still acutely aware of the Occupation years. In its rhetoric and discourse, the FN continually makes both overt and covert references to the wartime period. In recent years it has talked about an <i>décadence</i>’; and it has talked about the need for all FN members and supporters to ‘resist’ heightened immigration levels and governmental policies that, in its view, put the best interests of France in jeopardy. Likewise, in the pages of the FN’s journals and mainstream newspapers, the wartime period is still a subject for debate. Occupationrelated topics are still big news—in particular the issue of the treatment of Jews. The FN has advanced a rather unpleasant form of antisemitism: making jokes, playing on words, and generally trivialising the experience of Jews during the Second World War and in France today. Fenby argues that the rise of the FN, together with other social and political developments, poses an acute problem for modern-day France: ‘Forty years after Charles de Gaulle gave it a new lease of life, France is again a nation at risk.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a></p><p>These references to the most sensitive aspects of the Occupation in FN discourse are not just haphazard. Rather, they are part of an extremely well thought out strategy that likens the current immigrant ‘threat’ to the Nazi danger in the early–1940s. It is difficult to deduce the success of such a tactic, but its significance is clear: the wartime period is still very much alive. Webster is particularly interested in the anti-semitic issue: The spirit of Vichy’s unrepentant anti-Semites is still alive, nurtured by politicians like the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has twice been charged with making anti-Semitic remarks and by the anonymous Jewhaters who dug up the body of an eighty-year-old man in the Jewish cemetery at <b>[PAGE 76]</b> immigrant ‘invasion’ and ‘occupation’; it has labelled those in power ‘<i>les collabos de</i> Carpentras in 1990 and tried to impale the corpse. Perhaps it was the nationwide protest against this sign of resurgent anti-Semitism that persuaded the Paris city council to end a long controversy and allow Léon Blum a little posthumous revenge.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a></p><p>It would also be true to say that modern-day France is getting better at remembering, commemorating and, in general, being far more open about wartime events. On this matter Webster mentions a recently established memorial to one of Barbie’s most gruesome war crimes and a new outpouring of information about the Drancy concentration camp in Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> On a more positive note, it has been recognised that Vichy’s emphasis on planning and technology and many of its agricultural reforms had a constructive impact in the decades following the Liberation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a></p><p>Historians of France are often reminded of the ever-present legacy of the French revolution. A student once asked his teacher: ‘When did the French Revolution end?’ The teacher replied: ‘We’re still waiting’. A similar kind of point could be made about the Occupation and its legacy. As Kedward and Wood state:</p><p><blockquote>It could well be argued that the identity of contemporary France is rooted in the history of Vichy and the Resistance in the same way that nineteenth century France was rooted in the Revolution of 1789. If that seems too bold a claim it must at least be granted that French republicanism today could not be defined without detailed reference to the Resistance, and that controversy about Vichy and collaboration has grown and not diminished with time. In both respects the Liberation of France is a pivotal image and event.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a></blockquote></p><p>There is, as we have seen, a never-ending fascination with the war, the reality of the Nazi invasion, and the issues and controversies at play during and immediately after the conflict. Perhaps in this new century, with generations replacing generations, the legacy of the Occupation may diminish. Or maybe it will not.</p>
