The kingdom, which was ruled by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire (c.1565), the kingdom became independent. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.<br><br>The kingdom reached the height of its military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto ruler Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan.

Success in the first two Anglo-Mysore wars was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. Following Tipu’s death in the fourth war of 1799, large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British, which signalled the end of a period of Mysorean hegemony over southern Deccan.

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">OUTLINE</a></h4>
<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">TIMELINE OF INDIAN HISTORY (1510-1803)</a></h4>
	<p>
	As late as <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">1785</a> the British were poorly informed about India outside <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">Madras</a> and its immediate hinterland, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">Bombay Island</a> and a few other centers. During <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">wars</a> with the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> between 1778 and 1783, the Company's effort nearly came to grief when the fast cavalry of its enemies caught its armies badly off balance. Knowledge of the interior of the country, its manufactures, population and agricultural statistics, remained similarly patchy, confined to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a> and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">Madras</a> hinterland. Within a generation all this had changed. In 1808 the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> ruler and general of 'predatory cavalry', Jaswant Rao Holkar, remarked on the invaders' 'practice and favourite object' of receiving 'intelligence of all occurrences and transactions in every quarter'. Well-informed residents and Company news writers reported from all the major Indian courts. The army had created specialist posts and intelligence units. Surveyors and amateur ethnographers had traversed much of central India. The Company's intelligentsia had moved on from the study of classical texts and was now constructing statistical accounts of Indian agriculture, commerce and castes. The results of this surveillance were disseminated in officially approved journals to a more expert body of civil and military officers.
	
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
	The expansion of knowledge was not so much a by-product of empire as a condition for it. Recent studies have shown that historians have exaggerated the military superiority of the British in India.3 Indian armies were rapidly narrowing the gap in technology in the later eighteenth century. Where the British did have a critical advantage, however, was in their political planning and in the cohesion of their ruling group. They were now much more effective at anticipating the alliances and armed resistance of the Indian states. In large measure, this was because they were forewarned by increasingly effective systems of intelligence.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	From the time of the Governor-Generalship of Lord Cornwallis (1786-93) onward, the British began to close down bilateral and multilateral channels of information between the Indian powers. Cornwallis's government, for instance, discouraged the client state of Awadh from stationing news writers at the courts of its <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> rivals and tried to make the Nawab depend on information from British sources.4 Later governors-general set out to cut the practical and honorific lines of communication between the Delhi court and the other Indian powers,5 so terminating the discourse on rights and duties which had informed Mughal rule. Meanwhile, the Company systematically took over Indian lines of communication and established its own. This chapter considers in greater detail the establishments of posts, runners and news writers, which formed a significant but little-studied part of the 'service economy' of eighteenth-century India. It shows how the British penetrated and suborned this system. Finally, it examines the intellectual culture of the native informants whom the British enticed, bribed or bullied into their service.
	</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Posts, carriers, runners and spies</a></h4>
	
	<p>
	As with the Mughals, post and palankin routes (dak) became the arteries of British India. Regular <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">post</a>, with palankins and bearers to convey people and packages, was established between Calcutta, Patna and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> by 1775. Extensions to Lucknow and Hyderabad were made in the 1780s. Communication by sea between the Presidencies was improved, especially after French privateers had been expelled from the Bay of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a>. Elsewhere, until Wellesley's wars, the Company often continued to rely on existing establishments of Mughal origin.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Many of these Indian agencies were no longer run by directly controlled officials as they had been under the Mughals. Indian powers, including the Company, farmed out the rights of head postmaster to wealthy men such as merchants or landowners and these maintained their own bodies of runners. The British soon began to be irked by the way in which their communications were intertwined with those of their enemies. For example, the dak on the critical route between north and south India via the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a>-controlled town of Cuttack had been managed over many years by the family of Mahomed Waris, who were wealthy merchants and shipowners in the town of Thaumnagar. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a> and the British both employed Mahomed Waris as postmaster in the province. During the prelude to the Mysore <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">War</a> of 1799, Neil Edmonstone of the Persian Department ordered him to intercept the mails of Bugaji Pandit, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> ambassador at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a>. The intercepted letters included a number sent to the ambassador by the agent at Cuttak of the great Calcutta and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> banking firm of Manohar Das under seal of his master. This bank was critical to British financial operations across India, and the incident illustrates how difficult it still was to distinguish between friend and foe, or between the political and commercial spheres in eighteenth-century India. Unfortunately for Mahomed Waris, the banker's agent now complained to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> Governor of his duplicity in manipulating a previously open system of communication in the British interest. The Governor had Mahomed Waris dragged before him and threatened to 'blow him from a gun' unless he, in turn, held up the British mail between Madras and Calcutta. For a time the Postmaster simply directed the British mail onto another route. One despatch, however, fell into the hands of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a>. The runner was nearly flogged to death and Mahomed Waris's property was seized by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a>.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	It was incidents such as this which made the British determined to create their own daks and, wherever possible, to close down the communications of their potential rivals. As political tension rose, British residents put pressure on rulers to allow the Company to open its own daks on their territory. In December 1798, William Palmer, Resident at Pune, informed the chief minister, Nana Fadnavis, that the Governor-General wanted to speed communications between the Company's settlements 'at this critical juncture'. He proposed 'the placing of '<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">Hirkarrahs </a>at equal stages on the road between this place [Pune] and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">Bombay</a>'. When Peshwa Baji Rao refused to discuss the request for a Company dak, Palmer put it down to 'his own narrow and perverse disposition ... rather than from any maxim or precedent of government'. Rulers, nonetheless, resisted the laying of Company daks because they feared the uses to which the British would put the information so collected. As laying a post was a prerogative of kingship, they also resented the implied dilution of their own authority. Later, when the Peshwa was browbeaten into accepting the British postal system, Palmer complained that he had 'conspicuously refused me the choice of stages and prescribed them himself at great and unequal distances', threatening great delay to British communications.	</p>		
	
	<p>	Indian rulers attempted to evade demands for regular dak, but by 1810 a solid framework of communications was operating. The conquest of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> in 1799 allowed the British to strengthen the link between the northern and southern sectors of their power. Thereafter, feeder lines were driven into frontier areas. The government's orders to Charles Metcalfe for his embassy to Kabul in 1809, for example, enjoined him to establish a dak between Delhi and Amritsar if one did not already exist and to take with him the 'requisite complement of officers and runners, securing their protection if found necessary by application to the local authorities'.	</p>		
	
	<p>	In order to create new routes for the regular transmission of information and personnel, the British needed to have access to the great labour force represented by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a>. Who were the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> of the later eighteenth century and how were they maintained? The sources reveal a hierarchy of agents from the highly educated to the lowly. Some running-spies were officials of royal households or direct dependents of magnates and British officials. Others formed 'intelligence communities' organized under headmen or merchant financiers who were employed by anyone who could afford their services. The word  <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> (lit. 'do-all'; 'factotum') had overtones of 'intelligent' activity<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[12]</a>; the Arabic kassid usually meant long-distance runner. Jasus implied spy, and did not necessarily indicate a runner, though usage of these terms often overlapped.	</p>		
	<p>	Confidential agents achieved high rank and rewards. The Eurasian cavalry commander, Col. James Skinner, recorded that his chief spy had been 'brought up' in his own family.14 Great rulers also maintained bodies of official harkaras with their special dress and staves of office who additionally acted as minor ambassadors and checked on local officials. Thomas Broughton recorded of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> sent with him by a raja in central India that they were 'smart, intelligent fellows ... so generally useful, that, like the ancient heralds, they are looked upon as privileged and allowed to pass unmolested, whereas other travellers would be in the utmost danger'. 15 During the journey, a group of Gujar peasants fired on Broughton's party. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> pacified them and told them that the British had 'passports', but privately called the villagers 'mere gunwars, boors', and asserted 'it was always lawful to outwit such fellows by any means. </p>

	
	<p>
	Households of nobles, British officers and even merchants had their own bodies of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a>, but the majority of these were of lower status. Mughal nobles in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">Delhi</a> had them on their establishments. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a>, Warren Hastings's banian, Krishna Kanta Nandy, had several 'pairs', who were paid about the same as doormen and other menial servants (Rs. 3 per month). These were clearly a lower grade than the 'intelligent' <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a>, and may have been drawn from the palankin- bearer (Kahar) caste or from tribals of Orissa. Captain Williamson noted that before the 'pacification' of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> had been servants who 'travelled beyond the circle of ordinary or daily communication ... What is now commonly called a cossid.,19 Later, he thought, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a> had become little more than 'running footmen' who were hired simply to confirm the importance of their masters. According to Williamson, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> usually carried 'a lacquered walking stick' armed with a square spike ornamented with a fringe of tassels. This stick, carried over the shoulder, was the only distinction between the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> and the lowly peon or footman who sometimes claimed precedence over him.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Among the Indians, the most skilled bodies of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> continued to work closely with ministers and news writers. In post-Mughal governments the man the British called the 'head of the intelligence department' (the daroga-i harkaron) coordinated espionage. Influential news writers would also gather about them runners and agents who were seen as their own particular servants. A British officer in Rajasthan in the 1830s remembered 'the Ukhbar Nuvees at Jesulmer, whom I once met coming out of the gate of that city with half a dozen of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">hurkarus</a> before his horse, bearing spears and wands of office, with another attendant carrying a chata [umbrella] to screen his delicate person from the sun'. The 'umbrella' was not, of course, employed for cosmetic reasons so much as to indicate the regal status of this king of information.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In addition to the royal officers and the agents supported in noble or private households, there also existed guilds of runners who were employed by the state,21 landowners, merchants or villages, sometimes on a cash basis, sometimes for a share of produce. The distinction between dependent and hired runners seems clear. In 1796, for example, Sukha Ram Pandit in Hyderabad was said to have 'despatched a hired cossid' [my emphasis] along with man of business of his own to a nearby town.22 Elsewhere, again, the term <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> seems to have become interchangeable with 'post-runner' (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">dak</a> dauria). These were the relays of men living in villages and subsisting on shares of produce who carried royal or, for a price, ordinary mail between one place and another.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	During the transition to British rule certain communities, such as the 'Mewias' of Rajasthan, who had been mentioned in Mughal sources, retained their reputation as intelligence workers. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a>, the Sultans relied heavily on the nomadic Bedar tribe as an intelligence community. Bedars provided <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a>, post-runners and guides for the military, and a large group of them was settled within a few miles of Tipu's capital at Seringapatam. Their women also became temple dancers and concubines of powerful men, giving their caste an enviable monopoly in the lower echelons of the information order. Bedars were recruited into British service.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	As in the case of bullock-drivers, the tight-knit corporate organisations of these communities of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> allowed large numbers of them to be mobilised quickly. Rulers and their agents applied for their services to the headmen or officials in charge of runners who usually supplied them in pairs. The pairs worked together and shadowed each other. Sometimes, however, group loyalties could cause problems for an employer. In Lucknow in the 1780s, for example, the Nawab's plans were revealed to his enemies, the Begams (Royal Ladies), because the ruler's post carriers and servants 'went to sleep with their caste-fellows and brothers', who included the runners of the Begams' principal adviser.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	At the bottom of the hierarchy of transmitters of information were impressed people of low caste. Enforced running or message carrying for a superior implied a particularly lowly status. Such operatives, even more than agricultural bondsmen, were regarded as the typical indigenous proletarian. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> people of the untouchable leather and parchment-making caste, the Chamars, had a customary duty to run for men of power. They were called daurias, simply 'runners', though success in the lucrative leather business appears to have allowed some of them to buy themselves out of this obligation with a composition fee. In Rajasthan the lowly Mahar caste provided many runners. In Gujarat, Alexander Walker, the British agent, cryptically remarked that the spies were from the same caste as the deeply inauspicious executioners. Where exactly the running or guiding took place was also important. In a swampy region of Rajasthan no caste Hindu would deign to guide travellers along the paths. Here the guides were invariably 'bhungees, or sweepers. Travelling these paths, particularly at night, exposed higher-caste people to dangerous miasma, ghosts or even pollution arising from the swamps. Really 'dirty' people were required to do really dirty jobs, but equally, such inauspiciousness may have protected the agents from molestation.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">Harkaras</a> were apparently trained within their families or were apprenticed to caste-members who taught them skills of running and survival in hostile territory. In the case of superior runners, some descriptions have survived from seventeenth-century Iran of an elaborate system of training through exercise and competition. Safavid runners ran to India and Mughal <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> to Iran. Their clothing and insignia, as described by the traveller Tavemier, were similar to those of eighteenth-century Indian runners, so it is likely that they were similar functionaries. According to Tavernier, the young Persian runner began walking practice slowly at the age of six or seven. The next year he began to run a league at a time 'at a handsome trot'. The following year he ran two or three leagues. At the age of eighteen, he was given water bottle, bread pan and other accouterments. As in India, great men attended events accompanied by bodies of runners holding staves; running contests were sometimes arranged between employees of different masters. The best runners could cover enormous distances with few breaks. It was rumored that some could do 100 miles in twenty four hours, though half that seems to have been the norm on the hazardous routes between Kabul, Delhi, Lucknow, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> and Calcutta. Old men in Rajasthan can still remember training of this sort taking place in the 1920s.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	A Marathi document of the late eighteenth century records the requirements for different grades of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a>, which included mental as well as physical accomplishments. The superior class of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> was supposed to be skilled in various forms of classical knowledge, including the Vedas, astronomy or astrology, and vocal music. He should know five languages, 'Dravid [Tamil], Telang [Te1ugu], Karnataki, Avidhi [sic] and Maharashtra [Marathi]. He should be able to write in six kinds of script, including joined and simple Dravid and Maharashtra. He should be capable of appearing in different guises, 'having a hardened body', and 'steadfast in bringing news in wartime'. The lower grades were required to command less scriptural knowledge, but even the third grade <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> was supposed to know 'three or four languages' and one script, to be clever and 'capable of appearing in various guises'. The training of these agents ideally involved classical accomplishments in the realm of accumulating and conveying knowledge. It also implicitly recognised the subcontinent as a complex of language communities.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	The reputation of the individual agent for honesty and exactitude was critical where a dribble of 'human intelligence' was often all that a commander could count on. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara’s</a> verbal skills as a reporter and advocate were all important. For reasons of security he only carried written messages as a supplement or key to the verbal messages, which he was charged to deliver. He was instructed to convey the messages only to the 'Presence' to which he had been despatched. Above all, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> had to get his answer (jawab). If a ruler refused to answer a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a>, or had him turned out of the city or the camp on a donkey or with a blackened face, this might mean war, or at least the loss of life or livelihood of the messenger. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">Harkaras</a> begged for answers, however exiguous.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	At important crossing points over rivers or borders, special arrangements were made for all agents who were not passing incognito. Lieutenant Boileau reported, for example, that on the road between Jaipur and Udaipur was the well-supplied village of Nim ka Thana 'which is made over for the maintenance of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">hurkarus</a> of the Jaipoor state' and its troopS.36 It appears that in this and similar places, part of the revenues of villages was set aside for the maintenance of runners. In Maharashtra there was a territorial tax called 'spy-tax' (jasudpattz) for this purpose, but no detailed account of it has come to light.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The survival into the post-Mughal era of this labor-intensive communication system is a puzzle. In the Ottoman Empire, 'running footmen' were used in cities, but the royal mails and other intelligence were carried by fast Caucasian horsemen.38 Chinese central Asia was served by a 'regular horse dawk'. Even in India we sometimes hear of 'fast camel' and horse dak, and even of the use of pigeons. Why were riders not more generally used? Cost may have been a factor; labour was very cheap in India, and with limited facilities for shoeing horses, it may have been that human runners and palankin bearers could cover a distance not far short of horses for a fraction of the cost. Humans on foot were obviously more skilled at passing treacherous and monsoon- ravaged roads, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> who did not wear livery could probably avoid detection more easily than horsemen. Under the British, horse posts were said to have failed when they had been first introduced.40 At all events, the system persisted into the 1850s when it was replaced, first by bullock-cart and pony services and then by the railways and telegraph. Even in later times, though, the postal peon trotting across the country- side bore a distant resemblance to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> of old.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Whether composed of active intelligent agents or simply running footmen, the combination of the state and private <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> establishments must have added up to a formidable population. Adding writers, it becomes clear that the information service sector in early modem India must have absorbed a considerable amount of manpower. Even in a relatively small town like Jodhpur in the 1820s, for example, 500 members of 'Hurkaru' families or 'messengers of state' were recorded,41 quite apart from the huge number of private messengers, writers, postal brokers and other agents.
	</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">The British come to terms with the harkara</a></h4>

	
	<p>
	Even though the Company's political intelligence had improved between 1779 and 1785, its military intelligence remained inadequate, especially on the southern flank where it faced the formidable cavalry power of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> state and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a>. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> rulers had created a powerful intelligence service and made good use of information from defecting Company troops and the disbanded Afghan Rohilla cavalry who once served the Nawab of Arcot. On the British side, only a few badly paid <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> were employed by the main columns, according to a scathing report from Col. William Fullarton of the Madras Infantry. While Haidar Ali 'amply rewarded spies and treated English emissaries with utmost severity', the Company was renowned for its 'parsimony', he complained.42 For example, one of the key intelligence officials never received more than two guineas for dangerous missions. The result was demoralization and failure. Typically, a Brahmin would 'promise to go into Hyder's camp disguised as a beggar' to discover his movements. Out of sight of British troops, he would 'skulk for a day among the bushes' and would return with fictitious reports or tittle-tattle picked up from 'some wretched inhabitant or Mysorean camp follower, whom he had ventured to converse with while he was gathering fuel or grass for his master'.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	This situation changed dramatically towards the end of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">Second Mysore War</a>. Hereafter, the British reorganised their military intelligence and cooperation with the civil arm improved greatly. Fullarton himself, a radical critic of the Company, made the breakthrough. In 1782, he wrote A private account of the state of the Carnatic (London, 1782), which submitted a long charge sheet against the Company for mismanagement and peculation. His attacks on the failings of his military superiors were as vigorous. Fullarton was among the first Company officers to recognise fully the importance of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> in fast cavalry warfare. When Fullarton joined the corps, Col. Lang only employed five 'intelligent hircarahs' and the army suffered from 'a want of a system of intelligence'. Fullarton, however, procured trustworthy middlemen from John Sullivan, Resident at Tanjore, and from the Nawab of Arcot. These agents then employed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> on a personal basis. Fullarton had these controllers compete with each other, threa- tening to kill them if they deceived him. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> were sent out to observe different roads and later examined in the presence of their chief. Fullarton, fully briefed, then interrogated them himself. He would enquire, for instance, where they stopped on the first day, whether they ate at a particular temple refectory or washed in a particular tank, 'occasionally naming villages which did not exist, tanks and choultries [rest houses] which were not to be found'.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Fullarton secured from the Raja of Ramnad in the dry far south of Tamilnadu a body of Kallar tribals 'who were perfectly acquainted with the bye-paths of the country, and stationed them along the roads in pairs. The more 'intelligent' agents were placed at bazaars and temples 'as faquirs, merchants and under various guises'. They 'wrote down everything which occurred' and passed messages to the illiterate tribals who conveyed them to headquarters. In effect, Fullarton had reconstituted under British control the classic Indian intelligence system, which allied the writing skills and knowledge of learned Brahmins with the hard bodies and running skills of tribal and low- caste people.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In cases where no news was forthcoming, Fullarton 'assumed that a large body of enemy horse had interposed itself'. Following new rules for 'intelligence, movement and supply', Fullarton marched the army from 'the Coromandel to the Malabar coast through the most difficult and before untried roads', thus scoring one of the first Company successes against Haidar and Tipu. These tactics were later extended to northern and western India where the British faced an equally mobile enemy in the Marathas. Regular corps of guides began to incorporate <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> reports into books of route maps.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In general, the British widened the purview of the indigenous security state by putting yet more emphasis on surveillance. Ghulam Hussain wrote 'The head harcara or head spy, in several of the best English houses, never fails to become their Major Domo and the hinge on which turn most transactions, despite the fact that he was often of “ the lowest clan”. The harkara’s position was, nevertheless, precarious and the more so in the army. George Hadley's Urdu dialogue of 1795 envisages a violent altercation between an officer and a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a>. Thus: 'Call Ram Singh hurkurrah. Go to Ameinaghur, bring exact intelligence where Dummodah is, what he is about and what force he has with him.' Hadley's officer has the cunning to send off another agent to trail the first. The first is found to have neglected his orders and to have fabricated stories about the doings of Damodar, the enemy commander. Brought before the officer, he is told, 'You are a great scoundrel. You did not go to Ameinaghur, and now you come intoxicated before me to tell me lies. Ifone cannot trust the hurkurrahs we are always in jeopardy, therefore I must hang you. The errant spy replies: 'Forgive me, sir, it is my fault, I will confess I drank parriah arrack [rice brandy] and fell asleep.' The officer answers: 'You scoundrel, I would certainly hang you, but your father, I hear, is a good, venerable old man. Give him a hundred lashes and turn him out of the service!”
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The suspicion which underlay the relationship on and around the battlefield was not fictional. Following intelligence failures at the battle of Assaye in 1803, there were persistent reports that Arthur Wellesley, Col. Stevenson and Shinde had all hanged their head <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> for dereliction of duty.52 Wellesley found himself only a mile from the enemy lines when he had been told by the spies that they were ten or twelve miles away. Although properly constituted corps of guides, which were entered in the order of battle, had been established since the days of Fullarton and Wellesley himself had laid down firm rules for 'regulating the Intelligence Department', things could still go wrong. A particular problem in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> lands was that trusted inhabitants of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Bengal</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> or the Madras Presidency were as easily recognizable as Europeans, thus the British were 'obliged to employ, as hircarrahs, the natives of the country and to trust their reports. During the course of conquest and settlement, in fact, the British made use of all the major intelligence communities of the old order for military purposes: Kallars, Coorgis and Bedars in the south, 'Mewias' and Mahars in the west and, in addition, diverse Brahmins and Gosain communities throughout the country.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The other main target of political intelligence was, naturally, the Indian court. In addition to recognized news writers and public <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> of the herald type, all the courts of the period were served by large numbers of spies working on behalf of rulers, family rivals and foreigners. These ranged from highly placed advisers who had been 'turned', through to old women and midwives of the women's quarters who provided a 'daily budget of tittle tattle' in return for a few rupees. Agents such as these might be independent operatives who took their intelligence directly back to their masters, or employees of secret intelligence officers (the khufia naviss, 'secret writers'), or secret employees of the publicly known news writers. Elphinstone, stationed as Resident at Pune in 1817, kept a daily diary of intelligence,55 tracing the activity of spies in the region. He interrogated merchants travelling up from the coast, had spies following the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> ruler wherever he went and even placed them with the headmen of villages around the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> capital. The Resident was particularly worried about the activities of the 'Bijapur Fuqeer', presumably one of the leading Sufi teachers of that town who had once been correspondents and informants of Tipu and were now thought to be 'tampering' with the loyalty of the Indians in the Resident's guard.
	</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Newswriters: the veracity of political information</a></h4>

	
	<p>
	An important feature of British intelligence-gathering during the climax of conquest was the intensive use made of the Persian newsletter. In the days of Warren Hastings, these had been collected and sent to Calcutta by Indian administrators such as Mahomed Reza Khan and Ali Ibrahim Khan. The generation of Edmonstone, Cherry and the Kirkpatricks, however, acquired and read in person despatches from Company and foreign newswriters as well as copies of reports issued directly by Indian courts. Though 'black' or 'native intelligence' was sometimes publicly scorned, access to the detailed information of the 'Persian newspapers' put the Company in a particularly strong position in India. Such a generous flow of indigenous intelligence was not generally available to European conquerors in other parts of Asia or in Africa.
	</p>

	
	<p> 
	The British, nonetheless, had difficulty in understanding the significance of the newswriter. This was not a system of accredited 'foreign correspondents' or even of resident ambassadors; it was a tolerated espionage system, known and accepted as such, and distinct from the establishments of temporary ambassadors. Broughton, writing from Shinde's camp, mused:
	</p>

	
	<p>
	There is a strange custom which prevails at all Indian courts of having a servant ... who is an admitted spy upon the chief, about whose person he is employed; and whose business it is faithfully to repeat all his actions, of whatever nature to his [foreign] employer. Seendhiya [Shinde] has one such in our camp; and we, of course another in his. This latter is a perfect original. He has been in the service of British Residents for more than forty years; and has in the course of so long a period, as may be supposed, picked up a collection of anecdotes of the most extraordinary nature: most of them are entertaining enough, but many not over delicate, and perhaps not always restrained within the strict line of truth.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The newswriters, and in particular the burains - old ladies - employed by them as peeping-toms in the women's quarters, kept all India amused for years with a flow of dirty stories until a more severe morality intervened in the 1830s.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In addition to accredited writers at foreign courts, the successor states continued the Mughal practice of having newswriters attached to sub-divisional centers, where they could report on the doings of local officials and check on defalcations of revenue. These officials also had the particular duty of passing on the names and rank of important, or sinister visitors moving about the state. F.J. Shore, passing through Awadh in 1828, noted that the 'King's akbarwallas' expected a gift for this office. One said, 'Oh Sir, I am going to announce your coming to the Asylum of the World.' Shore refused on the grounds that he would reach Lucknow before the newsletter, but this was obviously to miss the point of the office. Provincial newswriters such as this were reinforced with another level of back-up intelligence provided by 'secret writers'. In the Rajput states these agents were mobile, moving from fort-mart to fort-mart and picking up information on the misdemeanours of big landholders and local officials. Intelligence from them was kept separate from ordinary administrative reports (arzdashts) and from the reports of the accredited newswriters. These subordinate writers were generally suspended once British administration had established itself. 
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The right to have newswriters in particular courts meant much more than simply having access to a flow of information. It implied that rulers had a legitimate interest in each others' policies and had established a degree of mutual trust within the all-India system of states. Conversely, the more newswriters a ruler could establish in another's territory without reciprocal arrangements, the more sovereignty was effectively conceded. When he wished to hold out boons to the British, a competitor for the throne of Awadh is alleged to have assured them that he would allow them to have 'a [British] newswriter established in every perguneh [sub-district]. Acceptance of this level of surveillance suggested an effective concession of sovereignty to the Company. For a distinguishing feature of great kings since Akbar had been their access to continuous flows of local information. Similarly, Abdus Samad Khan of Hariana, seeking help from the British in 1807, stated that he had earlier been forced to side with the Marathas against them. He said he feared that without 'communication' with the British government he would fall into disgrace like Nawab Bambu Khan 'who in consequence of not sending information to government' lost possession of his forts to marauding tribes. To impede the newswriters of another sovereign, or to expel them, was tantamount to a declaration of war. Indeed, it suggested permanent hostility. For even where ambassadors were withdrawn during warfare, it was customary for newswriters to remain near their posts in order to alert their masters about the proper time for peace negotiations. In 1787, Kirkpatrick passed on a complaint from Shinde that the Lucknow court was obstructing his 'intelligencers' and he asked the British, as the Nawab's ally, to intervene and prevent further bad feeling.65 Again, in 1794, when G.F. Cherry was trying to ensure that an anti-British party did not remain in power in Rampur after a palace coup, the placing and demeanour of the British newswriter was a critical test of mutual relations. Johar Mull, the (Khattri) newswriter, was told to withdraw from the Rampur court but to 'maintain a channel of secret communication' with other nobles.66 The incumbent Nawab, Ghulam Mahomed, wrote of his 'grief and uneasiness' at the writer's departure 'as being an indication of the withdrawment [sic] of the Company's protection'.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In the battles over information which erupted between the major Indian powers, the British tactic was clear. They tried to overawe and suborn the newswriters of Indian rulers situated at Calcutta or other centres of their power, and to short-circuit their <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> and newsletter systems. One trick was to try to undermine the credibility of newswriters by sending back misinformation through other agents such as ambassa- dors. Again, agents or newswriters of Indian powers who were deemed too clever and effective were rejected as unacceptable. The British also attempted to get behind the agents themselves and attack the ministers in charge of intelligence who had despatched them. Above all, the more able Company officials were avid to receive all the Indian newsreports they could get their hands on. These often gave a better indication of what was happening than the sometimes self-serving reports of their own residents and ambassadors.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Ordinary newsreports were formally documents of almost tedious detail, describing court ritual and gossip and the daily proceedings of the court. Yet there was more to them than met the eye. They conveyed a good deal of social information, which was of value to the post-Mughal realm: the rise of new favourites, or the emergence of new factions. Indian rulers were also capable of using the reports to create a climate of opinion or justify a political move to be made. These could be proactive as well as reactive accounts, testimony to a sophisticated set of skills in propaganda. In 1809, for instance, Maharaja Holkar, whom the British regarded as hostile, wished to march to the Deccan with the possible intention of meeting up with the cavalry leader, Amir Khan. Planning to put the British off their guard, Holkar's court released a newsletter which purported to show that the Maharaja was afflicted by supernatural possession: 'The Maharaja became senseless, his jaws locked and it seemed as if death was approaching ... A voice from the Maharaja exclaimed "Do not be alarmed I am your deity".' The ministers asked 'What offence has the Maharaja committed that you vex him so sorely?' The voice replied, 'he has committed numerous offences and now you must conduct him to Jejury and prostrate him at my feet'. An astrologer fixed the following day's march to the temple of 'Khundi Rao at Jejury'; this was probably Khandoba, the Maharaja's tutelary deity. Holkar wished to march into the Deccan for political reasons, but by asserting that the god was calling him, he managed to disarm British objections and simultaneously gain credit from his Indian subjects and fellow sovereigns. Likewise, when Ranjit Singh of the Punjab wished to reassure the British about his military movements in 1814, he sent for the newswriter of the Delhi Resident and asked him to alert his master so that their enemies could not sow mischief.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Whereas the open reports of court newswriters were elaborate, intending to give a picture of the multifarious activities of the ruler and his social and diplomatic contacts, military reports compiled by the writers appear to have been more perfunctory. These were digests of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkara</a> information intended to be interpreted by military commanders in the light of information from other sources. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> newsletters of 1802-3, which were intercepted by the British, provide some evidence on their form. Much space is given to the size, movement and composition of the force of the potential enemy, in this case the rebel Daundia Waugh. The reports noted the villages where the Waugh's flag had been raised. There is a strong concern with morale: 'the army is willing', 'the foot people [i.e. infantry] are of no account'. In another set of intelligence reports, the troops were said to have been underpaid and underfed and had looted the military bazaar. Above all, the reports detail the possibility of factional realignment and speculate on the chances of detaching one or another war leader or local magnate from an enemy or potential opponent's army. In the case of Daundia Waugh's rebellion, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> authorities wanted most to know how many village leaders and local magnates were prepared to feed and supply the fugitive force. The newsletter was one of the threads which tied together the 'little kingdoms' and 'segmentary states' making up the all-India polity. At its best, it was a sophisticated system. Despite their complaints, the British continued to use it sporadically right up to 1857. Even thereafter it was never completely ousted by newspapers in the Indian states. Still, it was a fragile system, easily uprooted or subverted. Beyond the Indian plains, as the next chapter will show, it dwindled into oblivion.

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Munshis: mastering the mystique of writing</a></h4>
	
	<p>
	Newswriters were one important group of specialists within a much wider community of writers, many of whom were titled munshi. It was through the good offices of munshis that the officials of the East India Company made tenuous and ambivalent contact with the traditions of statesmanship and knowledge, which informed the great kingdoms of the subcontinent. The writer and clerical establishment approximated to an Indo-Muslim bureaucracy, which was also acquiring some of the attributes of a middle class. Writers were still divided by caste and religion; they still employed the language of the slave to their masters, and they still depended critically on royal favour. Mastery of the pen, the account books and the politics of the post-Mughal states had, however, given them independent bases of social power. It had also given rise to a tradition of state service above and beyond allegiance to any particular king or dynasty. By controlling diplomatic relations between the small states and the semi-independent provinces of the former Empire and serving the new Company state, writers could enrich themselves and their kin groups, converting grants-in-aid for service into more permanent landholdings. Tension often attended the rise to influence of the writers. In Ranjit Singh's Punjab, the last great successor state to the Mughals, conflict was often acute. In the Sikh army every offence had its fixed price and the commanders of regiments put the finances of their regiments in the hands of 'Persian writers, frequently low intriguing fellows, who plundered the common soldiers. Military revolts here routinely raised a 'cry for the blood of the Munshis'.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	In indigenous society, the royal munshi was at the top of a hierarchy, which stretched up from the common writer of the bazaar, through the clerks and men of business of Indian commercial firms (munims or sarkars) to the clerks of individual landowners and notables. The commercial communities used their own family members to write the accounts and Bengali or Hindi commercial letters. They needed Persian writers to communicate with the local officials and to check or confirm grants recorded by the registrar (kazi). Complexity of language and multiplicity of scripts therefore increased the number of writers in government and private establishments.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The British encountered munshis first as 'language masters', that is, people who taught them to read and write the Persian script. The relationship was a difficult one. Arrogant British youths were placed under the charge of Persian scholars of learning and, sometimes, of sanctity. Hadley wrote a dialogue for such occasions, and it appears that munshis were treated with derision, as a kind of 'black schoolmaster'. There were constant complaints about their competence. Hadley remarked that few munshis knew English and they were therefore in the predicament of one Mr Hill 'who went to teach English in Holland, but found that he had overlooked the circumstance of his own ignorance in Dutch', consequently master and pupil were unintelligible to each other.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Munshis to Company officials were in an altogether more significant position. Many officials knew some Persian and Hindustani and a smaller number could write sentences. Remarkably few, however, mastered the stylistic intricacies of letter-writing. This was an art in itself, and one with great political significance in the complex polity of eighteenth-century India. In 1790 Neil Edmonstone remarked how dependent the British were on their clerks to read and interpret the letters they received, vowing himself to break this dependency. A generation later, after the ministrations of Fort William College and Haileybury, it was asserted that William Sleeman, tyro of 'Thuggee and Dacoitee' and now Resident, was probably the only British official ever to have addressed the King ofAwadh in correct Urdu and Persian.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Expert munshis with long diplomatic experience were an extraordinarily valuable commodity for the eighteenth-century states and for the Company. The best ones could command salaries in excess of Rs. 200 per month. Though these did not compare with the remuneration for British officials in what was a pay scale divided by race, it was good by standards of other Indian employees (ordinary <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a>, for instance, received Rs 2-3 p.m.). The absolute confidentiality of the writers was essential if the diplomatic machine was to continue to function and the British made strenuous efforts to prevent their employees acting as double agents for Indian rulers, something which was common in the practice, if not the theory, of indigenous statecraft.76 While large numbers of Muslim, Kayastha and Khattri boys entered open educational institutions in the great Indo-Muslim cities to learn basic Persian, accountancy and the Islamic subjects, the type of specialist literary and political education required for high-level political and diplomatic service was very hard to come by. The coded language of political intercourse made reference to Arabic, Persian and even Sanskrit classics. Yet texts were few and far between. Faiz Baksh, the historian of Awadh, remembered the difficulty in acquiring Persian in his home village of Safipur only twenty-four miles from Lucknow where there was no Persian teacher, despite its status as a learned qasbah. He had to come to Lucknow to read the Persian classic, the 'Gulistan', and remembered carrying it under his arm to his teacher.77 The later generation of the poet Ghalib had equal difficulty in procuring texts and adequate teaching. Naturally, patronage was the key to advancement among writers and political secretaries. In Lucknow, the eunuch statesman Jawahar Ali Khan trained Munshi Faiz Baksh, who himself had another eunuch, Darab Ali Khan, as pupil. Together they read the great classical poets and Sufi saints.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The rituals of writing in the Mughal royal chancelleries had been elaborate. The whole nobility had been brought up to revere the art of insha or letter-writing as a tool of literacy and as a form of regulating proper social relations. The 'letter book' became a key form of instruction in right conduct, and collections from the Mughal period and the eighteenth century were still used as schoolbooks in the mid-nineteenth century. Thus the munshi should be regarded as more than a secretary; he was an expert in diplomatics and social deportment. Proper forms existed to regulate not only political relations but also commu- nication within the Indo-Muslim family.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Mehta Balmukund, munshi to a great Sayyid Delhi noble in the opening years of the eighteenth century, was an influential figure. 8o His collection of letters was used as a teaching tool two generations later. The writer states that the king 'discharges his duties specially with the aid of the epistles of the munshis who are masters of the pen and which by the grace of God are based on a comprehension of the hidden meaning and external appearances'. These writings 'reflect Divine Light', make the Empire 'safe and embellished, teach a lesson to all the rebellious peoples and purify the hearts of sincere followers'. 81 Secular and political knowledge here followed the pattern of divine knowledge, which was divided between the formal lore of the clerics and the hidden lore of the Sufi mystics. The regular exchange of loving letters between commanders and nobles, not dry administrative correspondence, was the cement of the polity. For example, the Sayyid states in a letter: 'You have written that the proof of friendship does not consist merely in the exchange of letters, but that appropriately worded ones 'banish every notion of hostility or sedition'. Malicious people may misinterpret communications but, 'Only a lover can understand the secrets of lovers.,83 Exact wording was crucial in a situation where a large number of oral intermediaries stood between the writer and recipient of a text. Thus a magnate advised another to 'keep open the gates of communication; for it will be productive of an increase in affection'.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Letters in the royal hand were the most honoured writings after the pages of the Koran itself. As another eighteenth-century collection has it, these were 'exquisitely beautiful and expressed in a bold, florid style, the purport concise and to the point, flowing from the amber-scented pen; neither vizier, counsellor, nor secretary having concern therein'.85 Letters were deemed to preserve the charisma of their writers. The Nizam, like other rulers, gave intense ceremonial importance to the receipt of imperial letters as a sign of submission.86 The flowery Persian of these epistles was not mere verbosity. Rather they were devices for painting pictures in words and illuminating rank. Letters and miniature paintings were closely paired. According to one letter-book even a son was to be addressed with exquisite politeness: 'My worthy son, the fruit of the tree of my vitals, the plant of the garden of my desire.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The munshi, accordingly, gave himself an extraordinarily high valuation. Faiz Baksh, for example, contemptuously recorded his dealings with an inexpert writer who, as a mere woman, was working as the secretary of his employer, the Bahu Begam of Awadh. Faiz Baksh asserted that the language of this person, Khair-un Nisa, was 'halting and unsuitable for the rank of her correspondents'. For example, she had addressed a leading official with phrases like 'Whoever says so tells a lie. Beat him with a shoe and turn him out of the city.' Faiz Baksh's letters were written without a first draft in classical style. His attainments purportedly allowed him to insinuate himself into the Begam's service and to 'accumulate information on private matters which it would be improper to mention to others.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	This was the education that the munshis offered their querulous and arrogant British charges who revolted against the flowery Persian, preferring the blunt and literal-minded. Far from prizing poetic references, the British translators tended to omit all poetry from the letters and texts they translated.90 But the 'verses' they pointedly left out may well have conveyed much more than the guarded and complex prose around them. It was in the very twilight of Indo-Persian political culture, as the Rebellion of 1857 gathered, that Ghalib was to sigh over the philistine literalness of the communications he received from the British Commissioner of Delhi. The great days when like-minded men could convey political information and nuance through the language of classical learning were over forever.
	</p>

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">The pedigree and intellectual history of elite informants</a></h4>

	
	<p>
	Just as the British adapted forms of revenue management from their predecessors, so the rational learning and information skills of India's elites were captured and put to use. During Cornwallis's administration several Indian judges were replaced by Britons because of the Governor- General's rooted suspicion of oriental venality. But until as late as the 1830s the Company's state could not have functioned without highly placed Indian functionaries as munshis and ambassadors. In turn, these 'native servants' helped to perpetuate the archaic, status-conscious character of early British rule. As some members of the Mughal elites were introduced into British service, however, the intellectual and affective principles, which had sustained the Indo-Islamic polities were distorted and ruptured. Some Indians responded to this by resisting; others withdrew into a more closely defined religious world, sheltered from the impieties of the Christian invader. Others yet adjusted to the new order and began to forge the mental and moral tools with which to construct Islamic modernism, Islamic purism and the concept of the nation state in India. In the case of some of the ambassadorial, munshi and newswriter families, it is possible to go beyond the bare details of names and paternity to begin to glimpse patterns of career and intellectual lineage. In time a map will be drawn of the social and intellectual terrain which lies between the 'fall of the Mughal Empire' and the emergence of Indian nationalisms.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Most of the Muslims in this emergent clerisy were associated with holy and learned families, protectors of mosques and descendants of saints. A few were the descendants of great Mughal nobles who had unwillingly taken to the lower status of political secretary. The British were fortunate because the decline of Mughal employment had thrown many of these service families into relative poverty.93 They were prepared to serve anyone who could guarantee the common peace and the protection of godly society, even if they were undisciplined Kaffirs smelling of impure substances.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The most prominent group of knowledgeable servants of the early British authorities in north India was drawn from the nobility established under the Emperor Muhammad Shah (1719-48). This is not surprising. Without substantial incomes from service these large, high-spending families could not survive. The rulers of the successor states had recalled many of the land grants for service on which they had lived, and the imposition of British rule had squeezed out many sub-tenure holders. The Marathas, Sikhs and other eighteenth-century non-Muslim kingdoms continued to employ Muslims in high positions, but out of prudence they often selected men from relatively humble families, unconnected with the highest nobility.94 Even the Awadh dynasty had attempted to distance itself from the Mughal inheritance after the defeat at Buxar in 1764. Hyderabad, with its shaky and faction-ridden political system, was perhaps the only successor state where the old noble families found ready service, and even here they were battling against a challenge from the upwardly mobile Hindu writer caste, the Kayasthas.96 The British were the last resort, and the relatively unprejudiced attitude of eighteenth-century Company servants to matters of religion impressed the Muslim learned, despite the offence given by alcohol and pork.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	The most important of these noble servants of the British were families associated with the public offices of Hughly and Murshidabad, which had been, respectively, the chief port and capital of Bengal. Descendants of the law officers (kazi, mufti) and governors of Hughly were found all over north India in the next two generations as writers and ambassadors for the British. These families formed part of a wider group of descendants of people who had come from Persia and north India to serve the Bengal governors since 1700. Several families in this group were Shia Muslims, and the rapid upward mobility of Shias, from within India and from Persia and central Asia, was a phenomenon of the successor states and of the early British service. An important influence on many of them appears to have been the usuli tradition of Shia legalism, which emphasised the rational sciences and conceded the need to debate matters of custom in the light of reason. Wherever Shia learned families had come to settle, as in Lucknow, Murshidabad and Patna, this tradition was strong. It was an ideal administrator's creed. Shia service families may have felt they had more in common with elite Hindus than they had with poorer Sunni Muslims, their nominal brethren, and this in turn may have enabled them to adapt to British requirements. Bengal, anyway, had been the.richest and most relaxed of the imperial provinces and the education imparted by the institutions connected with the mosques and imambaras of Hughly and Murshi- dabad had been liberal and indulgent to the Hindu majority.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	One dear line of intellectual descent had been founded by Mahomed' Reza Khan; his administrative lineage was to inform British policy in Bengal and north India for the whole period between 1756 and 1830. Reza Khan was a member of a Persian Shia family of physicians. He became the most important Indian administrator in Bengal under Clive and had an uneasy relationship with W arren Hastings, 100 and was perhaps the last Indian to hold high office in British India until the early twentieth century. Mahomed Reza Khan preserved the ideal of political guardianship enshrined in the 'Akbarnamah' of Abul Fazl, and tried to impress on the British the importance of moderate behaviour and accessible justice. Following the tenets of Abul Fazl again, he stated that 'the tribe of Hindus,102 could not be subject to the full demands of Islamic law, though he also argued for the ultimate sovereignty of Islam, opposing, for example, British attempts to make Hindu pandits full members of courts of justice.
	</p>

	
	<p>
	Ali Ibrahim Khan (d. 1793), who became chief judge of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> Adalat, was originally a protege of Mahomed Reza Khan and had had a chequered career in Bengal and Bihar. A Shia from Bihar, with Murshidabad connections, Ali Ibrahim placed many of his family in local officel03 and initiated their careers as landholders in Bihar and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>.104 Working alongside Jonathan Duncan, Resident at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>, he was influential as a go-between for estranged members of the Mughal royal family who had fled to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> and LucknoW. 105 Ali Ibrahim Khan established a flexible judicial regime which drew on Abul Fazl's vision of an accommodating Islam, knowledgeable about its Hindu subjects,106 but stressed again the absolute sovereignty of God's Law. One can speculate that his relationship with the British was an exercise in damage limitation. It would be wrong to regard this man or his peers as collaborators with foreign rule, or as traitors to Islam. Ali Ibrahim was trying to instruct the British in good government because they were servants of the Mughals and 'The Monarch of Islam', the Mughal ruler, remained the pole star of his politics.l07 His surveillance of the royal house was intense and, in addition to the regular north Indian news-letters sent to Calcutta, he kept Cornwallis informed on court politics from his own contacts with the Jats, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a> visiting <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> and Muslim officers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Khan was himself a skilled Persian and Urdu poet, responsible for an important collective biography of north Indian writers. Through him the British were able to co-opt some of the formidable cadre of Muslim intellectuals who congregated in the cities of Bengal and Bihar. Several members of this connection were later drawn into Wellesley's Fort William College, an imperial academy which was supposed to concentrate the talent of India and educate the young British civil servant. Ali Ibrahim Khan was, finally, a historian and, along with other contemporary administrators in both Bengal and north India, he was an unacknowledged founder of a consciously modem Indian history. Personal involvement in the politics of Warren Hastings's <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> wars provided him with information for a study, which covered the years 1757-80.
</p>
	
	<p>
	Ali Ibrahim was, in his turn, 'patron and master' in the 'principles of rectitude and honour in the service of government, of Maulvi Abdul Kadir Khan, son of Mir Wasil Ali Khan, who had been a servant of Mir Kasim, former Nawab of Bengal. Abdul Kadir, sometime Judge of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> Civil Court, became another pre-eminent early British servant and information collector. The principles of statecraft, like those of religion and science, were passed down the chains of pupil-teacher relationships. Abdul Kadir Khan had strong Hindu connections, spending his later career as an intermediary between the British and Amrit Rao, brother of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> Peshwa, who was an expatriate in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>.112 His preceptor, Ali Ibrahim, introduced him to this sphere of diplomacy and he probably accompanied him on some of his early missions. Abdul Kadir Khan later became the key British negotiator with Nepal, visiting the country several times on British missions and writing reports for them on its trade and topography. This sequence of positions is itself revealing. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> Brahmin contacts inherited from Ali Ibrahim would have given him an introduction to their caste-fellows among the hill Brahmins who conducted Nepali politics. Abdul Kadir's training in the Muslim sciences and law appears to have fitted him well for the topographical and statistical interests, which were prized among Company servants. A report he wrote on the Tarai region below the Himalayas shows how easy it was for him to conceive the world in terms of political economy. He analysed the movements of the borders herdsmen in terms, which would not have seemed out of place in Sir John Sinclair's contemporary Description of Scotland. Abdul Kadir Khan went on to serve as munshi in the Lucknow Residency. He was rewarded with land in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> and, even in retirement, continued to act as an informant and adviser to the British. He played an important role, for example, in helping to compromise the severe conflict, which broke out between Hindus and Muslims in the city in 1809 over the status of a Hindu shrine which lay close to a mosque.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A second constellation of families of native informants hailed from the towns of the mid-Ganges valley, Allahabad, Jaunpur, Lucknow, and their associated qasbahs, which were also suffering from the decline of opportunities for service. Typical figures here were Khairuddin Khan Illahabadi, another historian, and his relative Salahuddin, confidential agents to James Browne and James Anderson, British envoys to the Court of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> prince, Shinde. Khairuddin's fundamental loyalty to the Mughal court, over which he had great influence, led the British to suspect him of 'treason', that is partiality to the Mughals, and he left Company service in 1782. After a period with a Mughal prince in Allahabad and Lucknow, he retired to work for the British in Jaunpur where he wrote a number of local histories. Representative of his political views was the 'Ibratnamah' or 'Book of Cautions, which eulogises Nawab Sadat Ali Khan of Awadh, who had been enthroned by the British, and execrates Ghulam Kadir, the Pathan chief who imprisoned and blinded the Mughal Emperor. For members of this intelligentsia, the Emperor was still the shadow of God on earth and the Empire the plumb-line of universal history. Ghulam Kadir was therefore a figure of primal evil, similar to Dante's Brutus. The travails of the 'modems' as the Empire disintegrated seems to have been a potent force in the further development of Indo-Muslim historiography. Though this strain of self-awareness came to an abrupt end with the Rebellion of 1857, it is wrong to date the beginning of modern Indian historiography to the simple needs of the modern, that is the colonial state. Self-consciously modern history began with the attempt by the post-Mughal elite to adjust to the rise of Hindus and the British. Equally, this was more than history, it was political philosophy working by example, a discourse intended to turn grasping and rude men, such as the British and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a>, to God's laws and service of the Empire and to prevent the corruption of public office by venality, irreligion and brutish comportment.
</p>
	
	<p>
	A third group among the informants was drawn directly from the nobility of Delhi or Kashmiri Muslims and Brahmins who had sought service in the capital. After 1803 the city's economy revived rapidly, and one can exaggerate its decline even under the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a>. Still, the city's elite was certainly in severe distress in the later eighteenth century. Not only were the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Marathas</a> and Jats encroaching on landed income, which nobles received from the fertile lands around Delhi, but faction at court and a tussle between Sunnis and Shias threatened important revenue- free grants which supported its teaching institutions. By the early nineteenth century British service seemed the only guarantee of a gentleman's competency.119 Yet that service benefited from the continuing intellectual vigour of the capital. In the very depth of the travails of the eighteenth century, the school of Abdul Aziz and Shah Waliullah120 had propounded a tradition of rationalistic teaching in Sunni theology, philosophy and law, which was to provide a training not only for Muslim administrators in British service, but also for the leaders of the purist spiritual revival which the British called the Wahhabi movement. Rational sciences such as logic and astronomy had been patronised by the Mughal dynasties in central Asia and north India and these too survived into the eighteenth century. The modernist reformer, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan's patron and relative, Khwaja Farid-ud Din Ahmad Khan was a representative of this tradition. A learned astronomer and geographer, he served as Company ambassador to Burma and Persia before becoming superintendent of the Calcutta Madrassah, an advanced teaching institute, maintaining links between the British and the Muslim elite of eastern India. Another similar figure was the Kashmiri, Tafazzul Hussain, who was Asafud Daulah's tutor, and later Awadh's ambassador at Calcutta where he became a confidant of the British. Tafazzul Hussain represented that Shia scientific tradition which we have already encountered in the cities of Bengal and Bihar, but which survived even in the troubled northwest, between Nishapur in Iran, Delhi and Kashmir. Tafazzul Hussain translated Newton and other western scientific works into Persian. A generation later Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan displayed a similar combination of skills in the Islamic rational sciences, openness to western knowledge and intermediary status in relation to the British.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A further significant informant within this group was Munshi Izatullah, officiating Munshi in the Delhi Residency and later companion of the explorer William Moorcroft during his famous journey to Bokhara in central Asia. Izatullah was the grandson of one of the last Mughal governors of the Lahore province, Mir Niamat Khan, who had been powerful in the 1740s and 1750s. Izatullah's high standing among the Punjabi and central Asian Muslim upper classes was of great value to the British, as were his continuing contacts with the powerful Sikh families whom his grandfather had patronised. This influence was so great that Ranjit Singh commonly asked him to sit in his presence and treated his opinions 'with deference and respect which reflect both his ancestry and the value of his opinions on the Punjab'. Izatullah was apparently connected with the Delhi intelligentsia. His precision and concern with exact testimony, a central feature of the Islamic sciences, helped him to adjust to the methods of British information collection. According to Elphinstone, he was 'intelligent, well-informed and unusually methodical'. His extensive travelogues, which were later published in Asiatic Researches, represent a halfuray point between the Islamic travelogue and British topography. He reports dates, names, distances and physical features with great care, but Izatullah's imaginative world remains that of the Mughal kings and Sufi saints, whose monuments and tombs he always mentions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One feature of all these intellectuals and servants of state was that they were used to receiving knowledge from abroad. Many of their families had, in fact, come from outside the traditional boundaries of Hindustan. Muslim civilisation, with its Hindu, Jewish and Christian appendages, remained the centre of the world for them. They were accustomed to serving men of different nationalities who, like the contemporary generation of British officials, spoke to them in Persian and knew something of the Persian classics. Theirs was not a narrow or declining tradition, but a universal civilisation. That it was to fall later to the evangelical hubris of the early Victorians and the guns on the Delhi Ridge in 1857, should not lead us to dismiss it retrospectively. Of course, this intellectual culture did have its limitations. Its view of the world outside the Indo-Muslim ecumene, or critical public, was circumscribed. It is illuminating that when Bishop Reginald Heber visited <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> in 1824, Abdul Kadir Khan apparently put it about that the scholarly Anglican was Archbishop of 'Rum', that is Constantinople. Abdul Kadir's was a cosmopolitan vision, but one which still envisioned western Europe as a distant margin of the Ottoman Empire.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The very completeness of the old civilisation generally made it difficult for men to adjust their views of the world appropriately to the speed of change in the early nineteenth century. One exception to this rule was Abu Talib, a munshi who had worked in Lucknow and who later made his way to Europe. 128 Abu Talib's account was later widely diffused in north Indian Muslim centres. It consisted of a dispassionate analysis of the forms of government of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire, which sought to relate them to Mughal examples.129 Abu Talib was typical of that tradition of rational observation of peoples and faiths which we have called spiritual anthropology.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	While the great Muslim servants who filled the office of newswriters and treasurers were the most important Indian informants, other traditions were represented as well. At this time Hindus were less prominent as elite servants and informants of the British in north India. Many great Muslim magnates, however, patronized Hindu families of the writer castes who had taken to Persian, and several of the Company's newswriters are known to have been Khattris or Kayasthas from this background. The Muslim servants also had connections with commercial-caste people (often Khattris again, and Agarwals) who served them as accountants and treasurers and entered British service or aided them informally.130 In southern and western India, of course, the Indo- Muslim elite families were replaced by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> and Telugu Brahmins, though many of these commanded skills similar to those of the northern Muslims. Even in north India, western Indian Brahmin diplomats and traders such as Ramchandra Pandit and Bishambhar Pandit, ambassadors from the Bhonsla court, provided the British with information and contacts as effectively as they managed supplies and revenue farms. 131 Here too must be mentioned the great Hindu and Jain bankers, especially those of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>. While men such as Aret Ram Tiwari, Arjunji Nathji, Kashmiri Mull and the Agarwal, Manohar Das, moved the Company's money around India by credit note, the political economic information they provided was if anything more significant. Jonathan Duncan, as Resident at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>, held regular interviews with the chief merchants of the city. In addition to telling him the state of exchange on different centres, their agents in far distant towns and personal <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> were also able to report on significant political and military changes, often before the British got wind of them through their own channels.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Once again, this section has not intended to suggest that the majority of the eighteenth-century Indo-Muslim intelligentsia became 'collaborators' with the British in the modern sense of traitors to a national state. While there are a few examples of Indian information agents in Company service being attacked 133 and of later folklore treating them as 'spies' in a derogatory sense, contemporary opinion was apparently ambivalent about them. Traditional patriotism was not easily enlisted against political servants who had influence with an alien power that might easily need to be courted at some later time. Moreover, these men regarded themselves as physicians of the state. For many, their first loyalty was to the Emperor and they were critical of the arrogance and boorishness of their Christian masters. They argued that their rulers should adhere to established principles in matters of revenue management and justice. Ghulam Hussain Tabatabai's 'History of the Modems' (c. 1780) complained of the drain of wealth from India, British monopoly of public office and the impoverishment of weavers and the old nobility; he could, indeed, be considered a 'proto-nationalist'. Other writers denounced the British from Warren Hastings downward for violence and peculation. Even a local Muslim judge such as Umer Ullah of Jaunpur fretted about the violence done to local people by the drunken British soldiery. Nevertheless, most of the informants of the British were men of high or noble status and this was of great value to the Company. By contrast, many of the fiercest opponents of the British were people of humbler birth, with less to lose and, possibly, a more developed sense of traditional patriotism. Jhau Lal, the Lucknow head of intelligence who frustrated the British for some years, was an aspiring Kayastha of middling status. The Chitpavan Brahmin diplomat- ists who opposed the British in central and western India were relatively low on the Brahminic scale. Holkar's literate servants were denounced as men of 'low birth'. The people who surrounded the Begams of Awadh were meritocrats or eunuchs whose loyalty was not compromised by fear for family. While it would be anachronistic to speak of a kind of 'trahison des clercs' among the intelligentsia, it was of great benefit to the British that they could draw so readily on the resources of the talented and formerly privileged. This was a luxury denied to colonial rulers in most other parts of the world, and even to the British themselves in Burma and Nepal, as we shall see in the next chapter.

	Between 1790 and 1820 the Company's subcontinent-wide intelligence network began to take shape. A younger generation of experts in Indian politics among military and civil officers coordinated diplomacy and surveillance on the fringes of Empire. George Cherry, once Lord Comwallis's Persian Translator, became Resident at Lucknow and later Judge in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>. He expanded his contacts among pilgrims, merchants and exiles in the holy city. Cherry, in turn, was a confidant of Neil Edmonstone, who later became Wellesley's Persian Secretary and effectively chief intelligence officer in Calcutta. Between 1790 and his death in 1799, Cherry also used his knowledge to advance the careers of the Kirkpatrick brothers whose field of operations was to include Nepal, Hyderabad and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a>. The young Mountstuart Elphinstone, whose careful intelligence work was to be a major reason for British success in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> wars, was also briefly an associate of Cherry's, and began his career as a writer in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>. These men aimed to command the politics of the three remaining great post-Mughal courts in Madras, Hyderabad and Lucknow using the skills of their <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">harkaras</a> and munshis.

	Madras, and the Arcot court had proved to be the weak links in British India on several occasions. For this reason, a particular watch was kept on the companions of the dying Nawab Umdat-ul Umara, the short-lived successor of Muhammad Ali who had died in 1795. The fear was that 'discontented partisans' of Ali Hussain, the accepted heir who had been set aside for refusing to hand over the state to the British, would combine with faction leaders within the court and gain control of the Nawab's secret treasure. The aim of Lord Clive, Governor of Madras, was to 'restrain the intercourse of persons with the interior of the palace, by watching and controlling the gateways and in particular by regulating the movement of 'covered palankeens', thought to be the very vehicles of Indian intrigue. What the British were doing, in effect, was to monitor and control the fluid faction-building which customarily took place during the process of succession. New rulers often emerged from among a large number of affine, children and favourites of a former ruler, each contender normally supported by one of the senior royal women. If they failed to control these volatile situations, where succession was always in doubt, they might be faced with a new and hostile power, which could quickly overwhelm their rather exiguous military presence. Company officials tried therefore to impose two new controls on the fluidity of indigenous politics. Firstly, they were determined to make a distinction between an ordinary 'private' house- hold and a royal household in which public and political issues were at stake. While Lord Clive claimed that he did not want to violate usage by interrupting the obsequies of the dead Nawab, he stated that 'the affairs of a great government ... could not be regulated by the ordinary practice of individual families'. Ultimately, the British were prepared to accept only their nominee, Azim-ud Daulah, as heir, and the consensus of the wider family group and its supporters was set at nought.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As the crisis developed the whole machine of British intelligence was set to limit the 'intercourse' between the inner court and outside powers, who were customarily influential in the choice of successor. This is what lay behind the charge of treason against the Arcot court for communicating with Tipu during the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">second</a> and third <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Mysore</a> wars. Wellesley and Clive used this as an excuse to dispense with the embarrassing fiction that Arcot was an independent state. But Arcot's 'man of business', Nejab Khan, was no doubt correct in asserting that diplomatic communication with an enemy during wartime was perfectly consonant with Indian practice. He claimed that he was simply behaving tactfully to Tipu, as Wellesley had enjoined him, and that 'the particular warmth of expressions' used by the Nawab in his letter to Tipu's minister was nothing but an expression of civility. The classical tradition of Indian statesmanship allowed a game of bluff and counter-bluff by letter with enemies and the enemies of enemies. To the British this ran counter to 'the established maxims of the public law of nations'.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Even after the subjugation of southern India, penetrating the covered palankin was to remain a strenuous object for the British intelligence services. A large espionage operation was later established to monitor the contacts of Tipu Sultan's heirs who had been exiled to the British military station of Vellore. Lord Clive submitted to Wellesley detailed reports of every visitor to the princes tabulated under the headings 'names', 'whence' and 'remarks'. The comings and goings of court eunuchs, Sufi counsellors and financial advisers were precisely chronicled.

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Gossip, and the politics of the women's quarters: Hyderabad, 1800-3</a></h4>
	
	<p>
	As Andre Wink has observed, women had always been central to jitna or the process of faction and alliance-building in India. Whereas Muslim powers, and even the Europeans before the late eighteenth century, had used sexual politics as an extension of the arts of diplomacy and intelligence-gathering, the British now began to deny themselves this resource and solace. Most of the well-known empire builders of this period had taken Indian mistresses, often from the Muslim elites. These women improved their language skills and often provided them with extensive, though little-acknowledged Indian contacts, which could be tapped for information. Neil Edmonstone, the dominant figure in the Persian and Political Departments for nearly twenty years, had an Indian family which he provided for and' maintained quite separately from his European one. Francis Wilford, the head unofficial 'intelligencer' in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> following the murder of Cherry in 1799, had an Indian wife and family and maintained a staff of Brahmins and translators. He was later said to have become 'brahminised' over nearly forty years of residence in India.147 The new official morality sponsored by Wellesley and supported by an official class which was increasingly influenced by evangelical Christianity, began publicly to frown on interracial sexual liaisons. It was, however, the political costs of intervening in the politics of the women's quarters which made the colonial authorities so chary of such alliances: fitna worked both ways and information flowed in two directions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Such concerns lay behind the celebrated case of James Achilles Kirkpatrick who had an affair with an Indian noblewoman, Khair-un Nissa, while Resident at the Hyderabad Court between 1798 and 1803. James Kirkpatrick, like his brother William, was one of the most influential of the orientalist generation of empire-builders. While his liaison has been seen as an Anglo-Indian romance, it also provides some insight into the politics of information and alliance in an Indian city. Kirkpatrick's situation came to official light when a Hyderabad noble, Baker Ali, complained that a Muslim of 'great respectability' had asked for his granddaughter's hand in marriage, but that Kirkpatrick, who was having an affair with her, had tried to prevent his suit. Baker Ali complained to Col. Bowen of the Residency Guard and threatened to go to the Mecca Masjid and 'pronounce his dishonor to the whole assembly'. This act would have turned a private affair of the women's quarters, always a most secluded area within Muslim families, into a matter of honour and morality touching the community. The mosque was, after all, the nearest thing to a public political arena in an Islamic society, and this particular mosque, which held a black stone which had supposedly floated to India from the city of Mecca, was virtually regarded as a part of the Kaaba itself.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The situation became explosive when Khair-un Nissa became pregnant. The males of the family agreed to arrange for an abortion, but the Resident 'sent for the principal midwives of the city and deterred them from any attempt of that nature';150 midwives had always been a major source of information on events in magnates' private quarters. Gossip and faction rose to a crescendo when abusive Persian placards appeared near the Mecca Masjid accusing Baker Ali of prostituting his granddaughter for influence with the British. Placarding the mosque or Sufi shrines was a common means of communicating with the wider community in an Indo-Muslim city.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Bowen and Lt Col. Dalrymple, Commander of the Company's military force at Hyderabad, now took official cognisance of the affair because it threatened relations with the Nizam's court at a critical time a few months before the onset of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Maratha</a> war, when French subversion was still feared in the state. There was, however, some suggestion that Bowen acted out of enmity to Kirkpatrick, who had earlier denied him command of the garrison. Lord Clive, Governor of Madras, was informed, and on his report, the Governor-General instituted an enquiry because the issue had now become one of 'national interest and character'. In particular it was feared that 'an interested combination of the women of the family and even of Bauker [Baker Ali] himself' had sought to compromise the Resident and the security of the Residency.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The role of the women was the other dimension of this story. They appear to have been unusually independent and to have maintained their own written communications with the Resident, and other families within the city. For this was something about which Baker Ali specifically complained. Curiously, the fear that women might carry on 'intrigues', of a political as well as a sexual sort, was advanced as a reason why some Muslim patriarchs neglected to educate female members of their families. Baker Ali's granddaughter must, evidently, have entertained Kirkpatrick privately on at least one occasion. This impression that sexual politics within the noble household across the politics of Court and Residency is reinforced by the evidence of Dr Kennedy, the Residency doctor, who like so many of his comperes was an orientalist and intelligence agent. Kennedy received permission from the Nizam's ministers to go into the old city of Hyderabad and meet Sherif-un Nissa Begam, Baker Ali's daughter, mother of the errant lady. This lady appears to have decided that 'since a sin had occurred' her daughter could not be married to anyone other than Kirkpatrick (called here by his Persian title Hismat Jang). The messages emanating from her house were intended to put off the older Muslim suitor and encourage the Resident. Speaking through a fretted screen to Kennedy, Sherif-un Nissa reportedly said 'I wish he [Kirkpatrick] had her ... in the same manner as he might have had her before all the distinctions introduced by Moossa [Moses], Issa [Jesus] and Mahomed were known in the world', a remarkable sentiment for any Muslim woman, let alone an Indian noblewoman in 1800. Kennedy left in a miasma of intrigue. Since he could not see the woman he had spoken to, he gave her a seal to show her father so that he could later prove to Kennedy that she was who she claimed to be. On emerging into the street, the Doctor found that he was being tailed by confidential servants of the Resident and of the elderly Muslim suitor.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the end, James Kirkpatrick married Khair-un Nissa, but hereafter his career never prospered as before. Wellesley's new moral order for the British in India masked a shift in the nature of diplomacy. The British brought to an end the sexual politics which had allowed and Mughals successively to take women from the indigenous population of India as a token of their power and as an aid to their influence. The networks of intrigue and information with which aristocratic Mughal and Rajput women had maintained their influence withered in the face of the newly constructed colonial barrier between the court and the home. While such connections might have enriched the knowledge of the British about their Indian subjects, they were evidently too compromising to permit. In later years mlsslOnaries and reformers denounced the helpless dependence of the secluded inhabitants of the women's quarters. These commentators failed to realise that British government had done much to close off the political role of women and the family in its desire to distinguish between public and private information.

<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Eunuchs and newsletters: Lucknow, 1797-1802</a></h4>
	
	<p>	
	Women were important carriers of information and intrigue in the pre-colonial politics because the exchange of women was a key dimension of the lineage politics of Indian elites. Royal women, and by extension their maids, nurses and midwives, apparently played a much more forward political role than they did in the contemporary Ottoman Empire, where the seraglio was more rigorously secluded. The tribal and Turkish central Asian model of the magnate family had influenced India, whereas the Byzantine model was dominant in Istanbul. Yet Indian rulers did maintain large establishments of eunuchs, and these also were critical carriers of information and influence which began to vanish from the political world at the turn of the nineteenth century. They are too alien - and perhaps too embarrassing - to have received much attention from historians. Indian eunuchs played a similar structural role to the Christian Devshirme levied by the Ottomans in the Balkans, in that they retained connections with their families and acted as communicators between elite Muslims and subjects of different religion. The Awadh eunuch statesman Jawahar Ali Khan, for instance, was said to have maintained close links with Hindus, and Hinduised Muslims, including military communities such as Mewatis, and Chandela Rajputs. Many Indian eunuchs were drawn from rural Rajput and Jat backgrounds and were seized and neutered by roving princely armies. Brought up to be servants and ministers in royal households, they obviously could never father dynasties which would entrench themselves against state power. Their liminal sexual status did confer an important advantage on eunuchs, however: they could move between men's and women's worlds, coordinating information from both. At first the British relied heavily on the knowledge of such men, but they feared eunuch politicians whose independence might pit them against the growing European power. Mahomed Faiz Baksh's 'Tarikh-i Farah Baksh' was partly a lament for the decline of the influence of the old class of honourable eunuchs, such as Jawahar Ali Khan and Darab Ali Khan, who had served the Begams against the intrusive power of the Company. Not surprisingly Jawahar Ali Khan was denounced as a 'scoundrel' by the British.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One of the last occasions when the old court politics were pitted against the colonial power was during the struggle over the succession of Awadh in 1797-8 when Edmonstone and Sir John Shore, the Governor-General, deposed Vazir Ali in favour of their nominee, Sadat Ali Khan. Here the whole armoury of spies, news writers, eunuchs and female influence was deployed by both sides. Edmonstone's powerful narrative of the 'revolution at Lucknow' has survived. What the British and their supporters wanted to do was to challenge the legitimacy of Vazir Ali Khan, whom they considered an enemy who surrounded himself with 'panders and low scoundrels' who 'rage for independence from the English. Vazir Ali also appears to have had the tacit' support of the former Nawab's widow, one of the famous Begams of Awadh, who had earlier opposed and been mistreated by Warren Hastings. Edmonstone had picked up 'information on popular sentiments' which, he claimed, branded Vazir Ali a bastard. The heir apparent was supposedly the son of a menial and a servant woman whom the impotent Asaf-ud Daulah had briefly taken into his rooms when she was already pregnant. The chief informant here was a eunuch who was involved in the original deception. It was in matters of legitimacy and succession, and hence in connection with property, that the knowledge of women, eunuchs and doctors was particularly potent. Their influence appears not only in the great courts but among lesser noble families.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Vazir Ali's position was already weak. One of the most powerful men in the state, Almas Ali Khan, eunuch and effective ruler of the western districts of Awadh, had decided to oppose him, though he had not yet decided to support the candidature of the British protege, Sadat Ali Khan. Vazir Ali went down fighting the game of espionage. He despatched spies to keep him infonned of the doings of the Governor- General and of the movements of Sadat Ali Khan who was then at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a>. Becoming suspicious when invited to the British Residency for the New Year's Day dinner of 1798, he stationed 5,000 of his troops on the one mile between his palace and the Residency along with 'hircarrahs at every fifty yards to carry intelligence'. The critical point was to be forewarned of the approach of his rival Sadat Ali Khan to Lucknow, so Vazir Ali had more agents sent to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> to watch for any sign that the British were laying a dak to convey Sadat Ali Khan to the capital. The situation was particularly difficult for the British as Persian newsletters circulating through <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Banaras</a> 'detailed with perfect exactness the visits made to Sadat Ali by Cherry' explaining the Governor-General's view on the succession. Though every one of the express posts sent or received was specified in the newsletters, the British were lucky the secret dak they had opened to Lucknow was not detected and revealed in the newsletters, while the false ones they had guilefully laid to Jaunpur and elsewhere were noted and published. Thus the British were able to bring Sadat Ali into Lucknow and get him installed as Nawab in place of Vazir Ali. They had outwitted Vazir Ali's party, which included the Begam and her followers who had opposed Warren Hastings nearly twenty years before. They also outmaneouvred Almas Ali Khan who preferred a third solution.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	An important aspect of these events was that all the main actors in the case read the newsletters with great care and hoped to outwit their opponents by receiving precise information before them. The purpose of the minutely detailed form of the akhbarats and the great care taken to specify their author and the mode of communication becomes clear. Every single detail of the meetings or letters between one's enemy and his potential supporters needed to be known, so producing a narrative of mind-boggling detail. These court newsletters were, in fact, prophylactics against faction or fitna. Equally, the intensive use of spies was designed to trap enemies before armed conflict broke out and spread public panic. These indeed remained 'dynastic security states' in which information was at a premium. They were testimony to the informational sophistication of Indian society and politics, a sophistication, which was India's undoing. Knowledgeable and pliant, the north Indian information order proved too easily subverted by a power, which hoarded and controlled information, rather than transacting with it to maintain a system of states.
