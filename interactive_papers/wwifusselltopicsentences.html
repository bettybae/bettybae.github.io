A little more light has trickled through the mists that enclose the earth. But the sky has remained overcast, and now it dissolves in rain. With a slowness which itself disheartens, the wind brings back its great wet void upon us. The rain-haze makes everything clammy and dull even the Turkey red of Lamuse’s cheeks, and even the orange armour that caparisons Tulacque. The water penetrates to <b>(p.25)</b> the deep joy with which dinner endowed us, and puts it out. Space itself shrinks; and the sky, which is a field of melancholy, comes closely down upon the earth, which is a field of death. <br><br>We are still there, implanted and idle. It will be hard to-day to reach the end of it, to get rid of the afternoon. We shiver in discomfort, and keep shifting our positions, like cattle enclosed. <br><br>Cocon is explaining to his neighbour the arrangement and intricacy of our trenches. He has seen a military map and made some calculations. In the sector occupied by our regiment there are fifteen lines of French trenches. Some are abandoned, invaded by grass, and half levelled; the others solidly upkept and bristling with men. These parallels are joined up by innumerable galleries which hook and crook themselves like ancient streets. The system is much more dense than we believe who live inside it. On the twenty- five kilometres’ width that form the army front, one must count on a thousand kilometres of hollowed lines trenches and saps of all sorts. And the French Army consists of ten such armies. There are then, on the French side, about 10,000 kilometres [6250 miles] of trenches, and as much again on the German side. And the French front is only about one-eighth of the whole war-front of the world. <br><br>Thus speaks Cocon, and he ends by saying to his neighbour, “In all that lot, you see what we are, us chaps?” <br><br>Poor Barque’s head droops. His face, bloodless as a slum child’s, is underlined by a red goatee that punctuates his hair like an apostrophe : “Yes, it’s true, when you come to think of it. What’s a soldier, or even several soldiers?--Nothing, and less than nothing, in the whole crowd; and so we see ourselves lost,drowned, like the few drops of blood that we are among all this flood of men and things.” <br><br>Barque sighs and is silent . . . <br>Alternate Translation from Robin Buss, Penguin edition, 2003<br><br>The day comes on. A little more light has filtered through the mists that cover the earth. But the sky is overcast and now it dissolves in rain. The water vapour things out and falls. It drizzles down. The wind brings its great damp void back on us, with depressing slowness. The  fog and raindrops dampen and tarnish everything, even the roast-beef cheeks of Lamuse and the orange peel covering Tulacque; the water seeps into our very  depths, reaching the core of joy that the meal has brought us. Space has  shrunk and the field of sadness of the sky has clamped down on the earth, that field of death.<br><br>We are stuck here, idle. It will be hard to reach the end of today, to shake off the afternoon. We shiver uncomfortably, shifting on our feet, like cattle waiting at a gate.<br><br>Cocon is explaining to his neighbour how our trenches are laid out and linked together. He has seen a master plan and made some calculations. In the regiment’s sector there are fifteen lines of French trenches, some abandoned to the grass and almost filled in, others kept up and bristling with men. These parallel trenches are joined by countless linking ones that twist and turn like old passageways. The network is even more compact than we think, those of us who live in it. Across the twenty-five kilometres that form the front of our army,  there must be a thousand kilometres of trenchwork: trenches themselves, linking trenches and dugouts. And the French Army has ten armies. This means that there are around ten thousand kilometres of trenchwork on the French side and as much on the German . . . And the French front is only about one-eighth of the war front across the surface of the world.<br><br>That’s what Cocon says, turning to his neighbour in conclusion and saying: ‘And you see what we are in all that.’ Poor Barque, with his anaemic slum-kid’s face outlined by a red goatee and marked with a lock of hair like an apostrophe ... He lowers his head: ‘True, when you think about it. A soldier, or even lots of them, are nothing, or less than nothing in the mass and so we’re quite lost, drowned, like the few drops of blood we are in this deluge of men and things.’ Barque sighs and falls silent.'); break;

My first shell on the other hand left me unmoved, for it made so very little noise. True it was a small shell, but I had heard such bloodcurdling stories and felt pleasantly relieved.<br><br>The trenches themselves were more or less what I had expected. They were, in brief, just trenches, sandbagged and traversed. Behind them stood the gaunt ruin of a convent in whose watery cellars the company officers had their meals. Dinner in the evening was a pleasant diversion. The cook managed to produce, as a rule, four course out  out of army rations and any extras we had managed to pick up in the villages at the back. I always remember with gratitude an excellent savoury consisting of a French prune enwrapped in a papery slice of bacon. The floor of the cellar held some foot or so of water, and we sat on boxes with our feet piled on heaps of bricks, fortuitously collected by the batman. Night in the trenches was the most enduring experience of all. I can remember every detail with stark clarity. It was early March, and when I first arrived there was a spell of cold frosty weather. The relief of being able to stand up at full height without dyspeptic stoopings, the joy of being able to climb on the parapet or look undeterred over at the Germans, and wonder what was stirring in that alien land, made the nights worth waiting for. At intervals along the trench came the discreet glow of coal braziers, well screened. Round them sat the misty figures  of men off duty. One in every three men stood at the parapet on sentry duty. My task was intermittent — usually three hours on duty and three off, fooff, for sleep.<br><br>Those nights had a beauty of their own which will never be repeated. Our trenches stood on a faint slope, just overlooking German ground, with a vista of vague plainland below. Away to right and left stretched the great lines of defense as far as eye and imagination could stretch them. I used to wonder how long it would take for me to walk from the beaches of the North Sea to that curious end of all fighting against the Swiss boundary; to try to guess what each end looked like; to imagine what would happen if I passed a verbal message, in the manner of the parlor game, along to the next man on my right to be delivered to the end man of all up against the Alps. Would anything intelligible at all emerge?<br><br>The two lines and their no-man’s-land were clear and distinct, made obvious by the intermittent star-shells that never ceased being shot into the air. Sometimes for reassurance that nothing was brewing out in front, sometimes for my own sheer pleasure, I would take one of the great verey-light pistols that lay handy at intervals on the parapet and fire it into the sky.

<center><b>Preface</b></center><br>
<br>
(1) This book is about the British experience on the Western Front from 1914 to
1918 and some of the literary means by which it has been remembered, conventionalized,
and mythologized. It is also about the literary dimensions of the 
trench experience itself. Indeed, if the book had a subtitle, it would be something
like “An Inquiry into the Curious Literariness of Renal Life.” I have focused
on places and situations where literary tradition and real life notably transect,
and in doing so I have tried to understand something of the simultaneous
and reciprocal process by which life feeds materials to literature while literature
returns the favor by conferring forms upon life. And I have been concerned with
something more: the way the dynamics and iconography of the Great War have
proved crucial political, rhetorical, and artistic determinants on subsequent life.
At the same time the war was relying on inherited myth, it was generating new
myth, and that myth is part of the fiber of our own lives. <br>
<br>
(2) In suggesting the forms of that myth, I have tried to supply contexts, both actual
and literary, for writers who have most effectively memorialized the Great
War as a historical experience with conspicuous imaginative and artistic meaning. <br>
<br>
(3) Correctly or not, the current idea of “the Great War” derives primarily from
images of the trenches in France and Belgium.<br>
<br>
(4) My work on this book has been eased by the kindness of three institutions.<br>
<br>
(5) As always, it is to Betty that I owe the most. She has sustained me generously
with interest, encouragement, criticism, and much more.<br>

<center>THE TRENCH SCENE</center><br>
<br>
(1) The idea of “the trenches” has been assimilated so successfully by metaphor
and myth (“Georgian complacency died in the trenches”) that it is
not easy now to recover a feeling for the actualities. <i>Entrenched</i>, in an
expression like <i>entrenched power</i>, has been a dead metaphor so long that
we must bestir ourselves to recover its literal sense. It is time to take a
tour. <br>
<br>
(2) From the winter of 1914 until the spring of 1918 the trench system
was fixed, moving here and there a few hundred yards, moving on great
occasions as much as a few miles.<br>
<br>
(3) Henri Barbusse estimates that the French front alone contained about
6250 miles of trenches.<br>
<br>
(4) The British part of the line was normally populated by about 800 battalions
of 1000 men each.<br>
<br>	
(5) Each of these two sectors had its symbolic piece of ruined public architecture.<br>
<br>
(6) The two main British sectors duplicated each other also in their almost
symbolic road systems.<br>
<br>
(7) But most of the time they were not questing.<br>
<br>
(8) There were normally three lines of trenches.<br>
<br>
(9) A firing trench was supposed to be six to eight feet deep and four or
five feet wide. <br>
<br>
(10) The entanglements of barbed wire had to be positioned far enough out
in front of the trench to keep the enemy from sneaking up to grenade-throwing
distance.<br>
<br>
(11) The whole British line was numbered by sections, neatly, from right
to left.<br>
<br>
(12) The trenches I have described are more or less ideal, although not so
ideal as the famous exhibition trenches dug in Kensington Gardens for
the edification of the home front.<br>
<br>
(13) The reality was different.<br>
<br>
(14) In contrast, the German trenches, as the British discovered during the
attack on the Somme, were deep, clean, elaborate, and sometimes even
comfortable.<br>
<br>
(15) Normally the British troops rotated trench duty.<br>
<br>
(16) The day began about an hour before first light, which often meant at
about 4:30.<br>
<br>
(17) During the day the men cleaned weapons and repaired those parts of
the trench damaged during the night.<br>
<br>
(18) Most of it was above ground.<br>
<br>
(19) Flanders and Picardy have always been notorious for dampness.<br>
<br>
(20) The men were not the only live things in the line.<br>
<br> 
(21) The famous rats also gave constant trouble.<br>
<br>
(22) One can understand rats eating heartily there.<br>
<br>
(23) Clothing and equipment improved as the war went on, although at the
outset there was a terrible dearth and improvisation.<br>
<br>
(24) To be in the trenches was to experience an unreal, unforgettable enclosure
and constraint, as well as a sense of being unoriented and lost.
One saw two things only: the walls of an unlocalized, undifferentiated
earth and the sky above. Fourteen years after the war J. R. Ackerley was
wandering through an unfrequented part of a town in India. “The streets
became narrower and narrower as I turned and turned,” he writes, “until
I felt I was back in the trenches, the houses upon either side being so
much of the same color and substance as the rough ground between.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> 
That lost feeling is what struck Major Frank Isherwood, who writes his
wife in December, 1914: “The trenches are a labyrinth, I have already
lost myself repeatedly. . . . you can’t get out of them and walk about
the country or see anything at all but two muddy walls on each side of
you.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> What a survivor of the Salient remembers fifty years later are
the walls of dirt and the ceiling of sky, and his eloquent optative cry rises
as if he were still imprisoned there: “To be out of this present, ever present,
eternally present misery, this stinking world of sticky, trickling
earth ceilinged by a strip of threatening sky.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> As the only visible theater
of variety, the sky becomes all-important. It was the sight of the
sky, almost alone, that had the power to persuade a man that he was not
already lost in a common grave. <br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> SUNRISE AND SUNSET</i></b></center><br>
<br>
(25) Morning and evening stand-to’s were the occasions when the sky especially
offered itself for observation and interpretation. Stand-to was a solemn
moment. Twice a day everyone stared silently across tile wasteland
at the enemy’s hiding places and considered how to act if a field-gray line
suddenly appeared and grew larger and larger through the mist and the
half-light. Twice a day everyone enacted this ritual of alert defense that
served to dramatize what he was in the trench for and that couldn’t help
emphasizing the impossibility of escape. The “peculiar significance” of
stand-to is one thing David Jones particularly remembers: 
<blockquote> 
 [The] procedure was strict and binding anywhere in the forward zone,
under any circumstances whatever .... So that the hour occurring twice in
the twenty-four . . . was one of peculiar significance and there was attaching
to it a degree of solemnity, in that one was conscious that from the
sea dunes to the mountains, everywhere, on the whole front the two opposing
lines stood alertly, waiting any eventuality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a>
</blockquote>
The hour of stand-to constituted a highly ritualized distillation of the 
state of anxious stalemate and the apparently absolute equivalence of
<b>(p.52)</b> force that had led to the stasis of mutual entrenchment. The hour was
memorable as an emblem of the political essence of the war itself, for
morning and evening stand-to’s evened out the advantages possessed by
either side. In the morning, the advantage lay with the British side as the
rising sun ahead silhouetted belated German patrols and working parties.
In the evening, as the sun went down behind the British lines, the Germans
 had the advantage: they could catch the silhouettes of the nightly
ration and working parties starting out too early. <br>
<br>
(26) What one stared at twice daily for years on end, thus, was sunrise and
sunset.<br>
<br> 
(27) It was a cruel reversal that sunrise and sunset, established by over a
century of Romantic poetry and painting as the tokens of hope and peace
and rural charm, should now be exactly the moments of heightened ritual
anxiety.<br>
<br>
(28) Here Ruskin asserts that hitherto no one has paid sufficient attention
to the sky, and that we have thus missed much of what Nature has to tell
us for our moral benefit.<br>
<br>
(29) <i>Modern Painters</i> was immensely influential in establishing the visual
taste of the Victorians and their successors.<br>
<br>
(30) That is evidence that the influence of Ruskin leaked down abundantly
to those who had not read him.<br>
<br>
(31) Here one might object that sunsets are sunsets, in all times and places.<br>
<br>
(32) Thus, by the time the war began, sunrise and sunset had become fully
freighted with implicit aesthetic and moral meaning.<br>
<br>
(33) Emphasized as objects of close attention by the daily rituals of stand to,
sanctified as morally meaningful by the long tradition of Ruskin,
these sunrises and sunsets, already a staple of prewar Georgian poetry
and the literature of the Celtic “Twilight,” move to the very center of
English poetry of the Great War.<br>
<br>
(34) In working up scenes for <i>The Memoirs of George Sherston</i> between 1916
and 1936, Sassoon recovered the Great War feeling for symbolic sunsets
and adjusted important emotional climaxes to make them take place at
such rich but melancholy moments.<br>
<br>
(35) This exploitation of moments of waxing or waning half-light is one of
the distinct hallmarks of Great War rhetoric.<br>
<br>
(36) Indeed, in Second War poetry there is something like a refusal to notice
that sunrise and sunset ever were mythicized.<br>
<br>
(37) On the other hand, traditional ritual meaning is what the poems of the
Great War are at pains to awaken.<br>
<br>
(38) It also makes the difference in two of Rupert Brooke’s five famous innocent
sonnets of 1914.<br>
<br>
(39) The process by which, as the war went on, these Georgian metaphoric
sunrises and sunsets turned literal and hastly can be observed in “Before
Action,” a poem written by William Noel Hodgson two days before
he was killed in the Somme attack.<br>
<br>
(40) A similar deployment of traditional literary terms in aid of the new actuality
occurs in Wilfred Owen’ “Exposure.”<br>
<br>
(41) Another complicated dawn in Blunden is the one marking the direction
of the attack in “Come On, My Lucky Lads.”<br>
<br>
(42) Dawn has never recovered from what the Great War did to it. Writing
four years after the Armistice, Elliot accumulates the new, modern associations
of dawn: cold, the death multitudes, insensate marching in
files, battle, and corpses too shallowly interred:
<blockquote>Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br>
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br>
I had not thought death had undone so many.<br>
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br>
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. .<br>
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!<br>
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!<br>
That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br>
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br>
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? ... ”
</blockquote>
When he was touring the Somme battlefields in 1920, observing them in
all lights, Stephen Graham found that full light did not properly illuminate
them. “Sunlight and noonday,” he says, “do not always show us
truth.” They suggest too insistently things like vitality and ecstasy and
the soaring consciousness of complete “life. “Only in the grey light of afternoon
and evening, and looking with the empty eye-socket of night darkness
can one easily apprehend what is spread out here-the last
landscape of tens of thousands who lie dead.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> A RIDICULOUS PROXIMITY</i></b></center><br>
<br>
(43) In the Second World War the common experience of soldiers was dire
long-term exile at an unbridgeable distance from “home.” One fought as
far from home as Alsace is from California, or Guadalcanal from Manhattan,
or Bengasi from Birmingham and Berlin. “Shipping out” is significantly
a phrase belong to the Second War, not the First. And once
committed to the war, one stayed away until it should be over. <br>
<br>
(44) By contrast, what makes experience in the Great War unique and
gives it a special freight of irony is the ridiculous proximity of the
trenches to home.<br>
<br>
(45) The absurdity of it all became an obsession.<br>
<br>
(46) There were constant reminders of just how close England was.<br>
<br>
(47) The postal connection between home and the trenches was so rapid
and efficient that it constituted a further satire on the misery of the
troops in their ironic close exile.<br>
<br>
(48) Both Fortnum and Mason’s and Harrod’s specialized in gift assortments
for the front, Fortnum’s fruit cake being especially popular for
lasting well.<br>
<br>
(49) The postal service brought the troops their usual magazines: one simply 
indicated a change of address and the subscription continued uninterrupted.<br>
<br>
(50) In the trenches one was absurdly near not just to England but to normal
social usages.<br>
<br>	
(51) If the troops were constantly reminded by transmissions like these
how ironically close England was, those at home were kept equally
mindful of how near the trenches were.<br>
<br>
(52) One reason modern English poetry can be said to begin with Hardy is
that he is the first to invite into poems the sound of ominous gunfire
heard across the water: There is not just “Channel Firing”; there is “The
Discovery,” written well before the war and published in Satires of Circumstance
in November, 1914. The speaker remembers a love affair
which occurred in an unlikely coastal setting sinister with a mysterious
menace:
<blockquote>I wandered to a crude coast<br>
Like a ghost;<br>
Upon the hills I saw fires – <br>
Funeral pyres<br>
Seemingly-and heard breaking<br>
Waves. . .
</blockquote>
-waves which break like
<blockquote>distant cannonades that set the land shaking. 
</blockquote>
So sinister and unpromising was the setting, so utterly brutal and “modern,”
that he could never have guessed that there he would find
<blockquote>A Love-nest,<br>
Bowered and candle-lit.</blockquote>
The poem is a condensed redaction of Arnold’s “Dover Beach,” but with
certain adjustments in the idea of the modern since Arnold’s day. Arnold’s
ignorant armies are guessed at but unheard. Those implicit even
in Hardy’s simile are palpable, audible. They are fully imaginable, as
they are in this passage too, where two people are walking on a beach
very like that at Dover:
<blockquote>The boots of the two . . . crunch through to sand or shingle. The very bottom
of the year. They can hear the guns in Flanders today, all the way
across the Channel on the wind. </blockquote>
We recognize it as distinctly in the tradition. Yet it was written not in
1914 nor as a recollection in 1929, but in 1973. The war is not the First
but the Second; and the two who walk on the beach and listen there to
the guns of Flanders are Ned Pointsman and Tyrone Slothrop, of the
Special Operations Executive and of Thomas Pynchon’s brilliant Gravity’s
Rainbow,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> in whose pages persists the Great War theme - already
mastered by Hardy even before the war broke out - of the ironic proximity 
of violence and disaster to safety, to meaning, and to love. <br>
<br>
<center><b><i> THE BONEYARD</i></b></center><br>
<br>
(53) Writing his sister in August, 1916, one soldier marvels at the fantastic
holes and ditches which scar the whole landscape and wonders, “How
ever they will get it smoothed out again is more than I can imagine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
The work of smoothing it out continues to this day. At first, some
thought restoration of the area impossible and advised that it simply be
abandoned. In 1919 the battlefields were still much as 1918 had left
them, but a tourist could visit them, assisted by a series of <i>Illustrated
Michelin Guides to the Battlefields (1914-1918)</i>, written in English and
printed in England. Gradually the road network was re-established;
craters and trenches were filled in; duds were collected and exploded;
nasty things were collected and buried; and villagers began returning and
rebuilding, often exactly reproducing a leveled town on its original site. <br>
<br>
(54) Today the Somme is a peaceful but sullen place, unforgeting and unforgiving.<br>
<br>
(55) <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a> today is one of the saddest places in France.<br>
<br>
(56) And a boneyard it is.<br>
<br>
(57) The notorious Butte of Warlencourt, a fifty-foot knoll on the road to
Bapaume from which the Germans strenuously held the British advance
in the autumn and winter of 1916, is overgrown and silent. Crops grow
right to its foot, dipping here and there to betray the persistent shapes of
shell holes and mine craters. Tens of thousands of men simply disappeared
here. The sticky Somme mud makes large unwieldy spheres of
your shoes as you climb to the top through the thick undergrowth. At
the top you can picnic, if you have the heart for it, and inspect the large
weathered wooden cross erected by the Germans at the summit and apparently
renewed at the end of the Second World War. On it is carved
the word <i>Friede</i>. 
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> WILL IT EVER END?</i></b></center><br>
<br>
(58) But the likelihood that peace would ever come again was often in serious
doubt during the war. One did not have to be a lunatic or a particularly
despondent visionary to conceive quite seriously that the war would literally
never end and would become the permanent condition of mankind.
The stalemate and the attrition would go on infinitely, becoming,
like the telephone and the internal combustion engine, a part of the accepted
atmosphere of the modern experience. Why indeed not, given the
palpable irrationality of the new world? Why not, given the vociferous
contempt with which peace plans were received by the patriotic majorities
on both sides? <br>
<br>
(59) The possibility that the war might be endless began to tease the mind
near the end of 1916.<br>
<br>
(60) At the front, as might be expected, views were considerably darker.<br>
<br>
(61) One way of dealing with the intolerable suspicion that the war would
last forever was to make it tolerable by satire.<br>
<br>
(62) All three of the great English memoirists of the war, Graves, Blunden, )
and Sassoon, confess to entertaining the idea or the image of the wars
literally continuing forever.<br>
<br>
(63) The idea of endless war as an inevitable condition of modern life
would seem to have become seriously available to the imagination around
1916. Events, never far behindhand in fleshing out the nightmares of
imagination, obliged with the Spanish War, the Second World War, the
Greek War, the Korean War, the Arab - Israeli War, and the Vietnam
War. It was not long after the Second World War, says Alfred Kazin,
that even most liberal intellectuals abandoned the hope that that war had
really put an end to something. As he says, there were
<blockquote>
so many uncovered horrors, so many new wars on the horizon, such a continued
general ominousness, that “the war” [that is, the Second] soon became
War anywhere, anytime-War that has never ended, War as the continued
experience of twentieth-century man.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
The 1916 image of never-ending war has about it, to be sure, a trace of
the consciously whimsical and the witty hyperbolic. But there is nothing’
but the literal in this headline from the New York Times for September 1,
1972:
<blockquote>U. S. AIDES IN VIETNAM
SEE AN UNENDING WAR</blockquote>
Thus the drift of modern history domesticates the fantastic and normalizes
the unspeakable. And the catastrophe that begins it is the Great War.
