case 102: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ACTION FRANÇAISE (1899–1944),</b> nationalist and royalist movement of the extreme Right, influential in shaping the early phase of Vichy’s National Revolution. Led by Charles Maurras and spearheaded by its daily newspaper, <i>L’Action Française</i>, the movement became the avant-garde of the French nationalist Right in the decade before 1914. Mixing violent polemics and street brawling with serious political and literary commentary, the Action Française’s influence peaked in the years just after World War I, when its brand of nationalism was widely shared. Between the mid-1920s and the eve of World War II, the movement suffered a long, but gradual, period of decline hastened, first, by the Vatican’s condemnation in 1926, resulting in loss of Catholic support, and, second, by the steady defection of younger and more activist recruits to the radical leagues of the 1930s. However, the long-term impact of Maurrasian ideas proved to be significant, not only among the many “dissidents” who populated the more radical leagues of the 1930s but also across the spectrum of the nationalist Right. <br><br> Though the Action Française had been, from its earliest days, vehemently anti-German, by the late 1930s, it had become a leading force in the neopacifist campaign, culminating with its support of the Munich agreement. This paradox can be explained in terms of the alignment of ideological forces, both inside and outside France. Though Maurras had little sympathy for Nazism—which he saw as a variety of despised “Germanism”—he had even less sympathy for those who, he claimed, would benefit from a war against Hitler: the Soviet Union, French communists and their Popular Front allies, and Jews. Although the Action Française opposed the dreaded “ideological” war to the last day, when it was finally declared, the royalists supported its prosecution. The defeat of 1940, which brought in its wake the dismantling of the parliamentary Republic and the installation of Philippe Pétain as head of an authoritarian regime, seemed, at first, to open a new and promising phase in the movement’s history. Though the impact of the Action Française on Vichy’s National Revolution has sometimes been exaggerated, it was real, specifically because of the number of well-placed Maurrasians close to Pétain and, more generally, because Maurrasian ideas had had a shaping influence on the Catholic and reactionary Right through the years of the Third Republic. The laws, institutions, and moral tone of the Vichy government reflected long-standing royalist preferences: from the anti-Semitic laws to the emphasis on the ideals of order, hierarchy, corporation, and authority. Even though the royalist daily, published in Lyons, often criticized the slow pace of the National Revolution and its lax enforcement, it stood unwaveringly behind the figure of Pétain. This benefited the royalists early on, when Pétain’s popularity was almost universal; however, as his National Revolution proved increasingly hollow, and his decision to collaborate with the Nazi occupier increasingly disastrous, the Action Française, supporting its surrogate prince to the end, shared in the increasing disfavor directed against his government. Further, the Action Française’s habitually vicious attacks on selected groups and individuals—now focused on communists, Gaullists, and Jews—became, in some cases, tantamount to death sentences as officials, both German and French, hunted down their prey. Hence, when the Vichy regime went down in the flames of the Nazi defeat, the Action Française shared its fate. <br><br> *F.

case 106: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ALSACE-LORRAINE.</b> With the beginning of the war, on 1 September 1939, 230,000 Lorrainers and 275,000 Alsatians (including all of the residents of Strasbourg) were evacuated to southwestern France. Leaders of the various regional autonomist factions were rounded up and imprisoned at Nancy. The most compromised among them, Karl Roos, an agent of the German Sicherheitsdienst (security service, SD) was convicted of high treason and shot on 7 February 1940. <br><br> During the campaign of 1940, the Maginot Line forts stood firm, some holding out until the end of June, long after the armistice. Five days after the French artillery supporting the line was withdrawn, the German Seventh Army crossed the Rhine: Metz and Strasbourg fell on 17 and 19 June. The entire French bureaucracy in the three <i>départements </i>was arrested and expelled immediately. Operating on the lie that a secret clause in the armistice of 25 June had transferred control of Alsace and Lorraine from France to Germany, the Nazis promptly integrated the region into their own pre-1939 frontier districts. The Gauleiters (local leaders) were two party veterans, Joseph Bürckel for Westmark and Robert Wagner (né Backfisch) for Baden-Elsass. Despite a vigorous protest by Vichy delegates to the armistice commission at the end of August, the Germans continued their de facto incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine. The proceedings of the commission were secret, and the protest was not known in the region until mid-1941. Meanwhile, the belief that France had deliberately abandoned Alsace-Lorraine to its fate took root. <br><br> The first two years of German occupation were spent in applying the Nazi institutions to Alsace-Lorraine. The sharp loss in inhabitants through mass deportation (to unoccupied France or, in aggravated cases, “to the East”) was partially made up by the return of the evacuees from Périgord. The second period, from mid-1942 to liberation at the end of November 1944, was that of rupture between occupier and the indigenous population. The Nazis had promised in 1940 that Alsace-Lorraine would never have to fight in the ongoing war. Suddenly, the conscription of all males between the ages of 16 and 34 was decreed on 25 August 1942. A whole new class was created overnight: the <i>Malgré-Nous </i>(Against Our Will). Despite riots and widespread defiance, 105,000 Alsatians and 35,000 Lorrainers went to the eastern front, of whom some 40,000 never returned. [Editor’s note: estimates of the numbers of Alsatians and Lorrainers killed vary because of the difficult immediate postwar conditions in France and the reluctance of the Soviet Union to supply information after 1945; see Autonomists.] <br><br> The development and extension of Resistance cells and networks in Alsace- Lorraine kept pace with the increasing repression. Many escaped to Switzerland, the most notable being General Henri Giraud in April 1942. Liberation came when General Philippe Leclerc, leading his own French Second Armored Division and three American infantry units, cracked the central Vosges defenses on 22 November 1944. The following day, his forces quickly liberated Strasbourg and the territories extending north to the Palatinate and south to the outskirts of Colmar. As General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny’s First French Army entered Mulhouse at the same time, the war seemed over, although a southern feint in the desperate German counterattack in the Ardennes nearly recaptured Strasbourg. <br><br> Alsace-Lorraine was quickly purged of collaborators: the number of death sentences was the highest in liberated France, but more commutations were also handed down because of the “special circumstances” of German rule in the region. Adjustment to renewed French rule was complicated by popular resentment over the apparent abandonment by the Vichy regime and by the involvement of several adolescent <i>Malgré-Nous </i>in the 1944 massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane. The nightmare of occupation, however, had underscored the pricelessness of the political freedom for which the French Republic, whatever its faults, had always stood. <br><br> *P. C. F.

case 107: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ANTI-SEMITISM,</b> an integral component of Vichy ideology, was manifest in the systematic persecution of French and foreign-born Jews. Holding Jews to blame for the “decadence” of the Third Republic and for dragging France into war, Vichy authorities acted independently of the Germans to deprive Jews of their civil liberties and cooperated with the Germans in the confiscation of Jewish property and the internment and deportation of Jews from France. The <i>Statut des Juifs </i>of 3 October 1940 prohibited Jews from holding positions of authority in the military, the civil service, education, and the press. Subsequent laws, including a second <i>Statut des Juifs </i>in June 1941, extended these prohibitions and restricted Jewish access to higher education and the liberal professions. As of June 1941, Jews could constitute no more than 3 percent of all secondary and postsecondary education students and no more than 2 percent of lawyers (July 1941), doctors, midwives, and pharmacists (August 1941), architects (September 1941), and dentists (June 1942). Administration of these initiatives was the responsibility of the Commissariat générale des questions juives (CGQJ), established in March 1941. <br><br> A German ordinance of 18 October 1940 required that all but the smallest Jewish businesses in the occupied zone be placed under trusteeship. Vichy responded by creating the Service de contrôle des administrateurs provisoires (SCAP) to guarantee that French trustees assume responsibility for managing, selling, or liquidating Jewish property. A law of 2 July 1941 extended the Aryanization of Jewish property to the unoccupied zone. Unemployment and the Aryanization of Jewish property created widespread Jewish impoverishment. Jewish philanthropic organizations attempted to meet the needs of destitute Jews independently but were thwarted by the Germans and Vichy, which in November 1941 created the Union générale des Israélites de France (UGIF). Subsumed under the authority of the CGQJ and responsible for the social welfare of Jews resident in France, the UGIF had to register all Jews resident in the occupied zone and supervise the internment of Jews in concentration camps throughout France. <br><br> As of 4 October 1940 Vichy had the authority to intern foreign-born Jews; three days later it revoked the citizenship of Algerian Jews. Within weeks there were 50,000 Jews interned in concentration camps throughout France and in North Africa. On 2 June 1941 Vichy authorized the internment of any Jew, whether foreign-born or French. After the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 determined how many Jews each region of occupied Europe would have to deport to extermination camps, the German occupation authorities in France demanded that Vichy cooperate in the arrest and deportation of 100,000 Jews. After 29 May 1942, Jews over the age of six residing in the occupied zone had to wear the yellow star; by midsummer they were denied access to most public places, allowed to ride only on the last car on the Métro, and forced to shop only during designated hours. The ordinance requiring Jews to wear the yellow star and the arrest of 12,884 Jews, rounded up in the Vélodrome d’hiver, a bicycle-race stadium, in Paris on 16–17 July 1942 provoked civil and religious protests throughout France. Nonetheless, by the end of 1942, 42,500 Jews (including 6,000 children) had been deported. On 11 December 1942 Vichy required all Jews to carry identification papers stamped “Juif.” Because Jews in the previously unoccupied zone were not required to wear the yellow star, in 1943, when the Gestapo boarded trains and raided cities in the south of France in search of Jews, the identification papers helped them to find their quarry. Although Pierre Laval refused to cooperate when Germany demanded that France revoke the citizenship of Jews naturalized since 1927, Vichy did little else to impede the Final Solution. Of the 75,721 Jews deported from France, two-thirds were foreign-born, who had sought refuge in France; one-third were French citizens. Only 2,500 (3 percent) of the deportees survived. <br><br> *†J.

case 281: $("div#commentary").html('<b>DALADIER, ÉDOUARD (1884–1970),</b> was premier, 1938–1940, and war minister, 1936–1940. In France many hoped that Daladier could be the Georges Clemenceau or Raymond Poincaré to lead the nation against Nazi Germany. Daladier, known to many as “Dala” or the “Bull of the Vaucluse,” the electoral district that he represented, was reputed to be a man of action who could unite the French against the Nazi menace. “A bull, with snail’s horns,” commented Neville Chamberlain, who himself was hardly a paragon of firmness against Nazi Germany. Daladier’s reputation exceeded his talents; often full of fight at first, then equivocating and capitulating. <br><br>During the war of 1914–1918, Daladier received a field commission and was cited for valor. In the 1920s he rose to prominence in the Radical Party, leaning left with Radical young Turks and willing to work with the socialists. In 1936 he was one of the main leaders of the Popular Front. He succeeded Blum as premier in April 1938 and went to Munich in September 1938 to condone the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Some say Daladier had no choice; others say that he failed to support the <i>bellicistes </i>in his cabinet. He turned against the Communist Party and broke up the Popular Front in November 1938, crushing a general strike against government take-backs of gains made in 1936. Daladier opposed strengthening the Franco–Soviet mutual assistance pact (1935); opposed Franco–Soviet military staff talks (1936–1938); and did not pursue with sufficient energy an Anglo–Franco–Soviet alliance in 1939, instructing his chief delegate to staff talks in Moscow (August 1939) not to agree to Red Army passage across Poland to fight the enemy. <br><br>After September 1939 Daladier quarreled with Paul Reynaud and stubbornly defended General Maurice-Gustave Gamelin against charges of failing to pursue the war with sufficient vigor. Daladier resigned as premier in March 1940, as his reputation and political power crumbled.

Opposed to Nazi Germany, he was the only right-wing deputy who, joining one socialist and 75 communists, voted against the 1938 Munich agreement. Rejecting the 1940 armistice and hunted by the Gestapo, Kérillis fled to the United States, where he initially supported General de Gaulle but believed that the general should limit himself to military activity on behalf of the Allies while staying out of politics, a view shared by about a third of the French exiles in the United States. With other such “dissident” journalists, including Geneviève Tabouis and Pertinax (André Géraud), Kérillis founded a newspaper, <i>Pour la Victoire</i>, in January 1942. In a 1945 book entitled <i>De Gaulle dictateur</i>, he later expanded his view of the general as a political usurper. Following the Allied landings in North Africa, November 1942, Kérillis supported the State Department’s attempts to marginalize de Gaulle by dealing with first Admiral Darlan, then General Henri Giraud. Kérillis’ violent articles against de Gaulle in <i>Pour la Victoire </i>were opposed by the American Gaullist organization France Forever. Kérillis greeted the creation of the Comité Français de Libération Nationale in 1943 with a passionate campaign, in which he wrote that, actually hampering the liberation of France, “de Gaulle had installed in Algiers the most dictatorial constitution that France had ever known.” Following the liberation, Kérillis, preferring direct American military rule to de Gaulle, argued that France no longer had a legal government. <br><br>Kérillis and his colleagues, including Alexis Léger, in large measure agreed with Roosevelt, fearing the dictatorial power of de Gaulle, whom they saw as a military man, nationalistic, ambitious, and antidemocratic, with no popular investiture. In addition, however, Kérillis had a son, who had joined Free France, was parachuted into France, then was caught and tortured to death by Gestapo agents. Kérillis accused de Gaulle’s secret services of having denounced his son. This episode helped justify and sharpened Kérillis’ already virulent anti- Gaullism.

is your nature, though strong, to act feebly; when your plans are most prudent to distrust them; and when calamities come upon you to think that 
you will never be delivered from them. They are impetuous, and you are dilatory; they are always abroad, and you are always at home. For

THIS IS NOT <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-500"><b>Henri de Kérillis</b></a> speaking but Thucydides’ 
version of the Corinthian ambassadors’ talking the Spartans into going to war against an aggressive Athens. It is also a good description of the mood in which the French 
faced a formidable enemy. <b>[p.258]</b><br><br>

France’s fortunes in war and its approach to war are indissoluble from the run-up to it. But the run-up itself was part of the experience. 
Before catastrophe came, a phony peace preceded phony war. “We live in a strange intermediate state between peace and war,” Henri Lefebvre wrote a fellow leftist 
in April 1939. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> One of the strangest aspects of this uncertain 
time are the contradictory signals sent by the powers that be: <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier
</b></a> and Reynaud wanted rearmament to move full speed ahead; the Foreign Ministry under Georges Bonnet insisted that all go easy on Hitler and Mussolini.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> Fashion greeted “the conjunction of Venus and Mars” by designing <i>tailleur</i> 
costumes “clean cut and with a military air,” but also flouncy petticoats and corsets with whalebone stays. With summer, <i>Femina</i> 
recommended “<i>Défense passive</i>” sunglasses against too strong a glare. The cinema was even less equivocal. Films dark with foreboding were 
increasingly spelled by inspiriting features — <i>Trois de St Cyr</i>, <i>Gunga Din</i> — and by newsreels that bulged 
with armaments.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a><br><br>

Counterpart of uneasy times, “the greatest criminal of our days since Landru” was being tried at Versailles. Convicted of murdering 
ten women and one boy, Henri Désiré Landru had been executed in 1922. Arrested in December 1937 for crimes committed 
between July and November of that year, a German interloper, Eugen Weidmann, had confessed at once but waited fifteen 
months to be brought to trial, then three more before his execution. The tale of Weidmann’s sins was simple. 
With three accomplices, he had preyed on tourists brought to Paris by the exposition: They robbed and killed an American 
dancer, Jean de Koven, an Alsatian girl, a visiting German, a taxi driver, and several others. 
Their spoils, as so often happens, had been relatively modest, but the manner of operation and the murderer’s cool 
detachment impressed a public less habituated to criminal violence than half a century before, or since.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a><br><br>

Weidmann’s trial, otherwise unexceptional, had been marked by orders to curtain off the lower part of the public gallery so 
as to preserve the sobriety of a court that would otherwise be faced by the distracting revelations of “very short skirts.” 
On March 3 the monster — more frightening for being recognized as intelligent and sensitive — had been condemned to death. 
The sentence of an accomplice similarly condemned having been commuted, the German was left to face his doom alone, 
in the small hours of Saturday, June 17, under the guillotine in front of the Versailles prison. Two hundred 
visitors’ permits had been given out, but the “repugnant crowd” described with lip-smacking disapproved by a prurient press made 
a <b>[p.259]</b> night of it. Clustered on roofs, at windows, on 
trees, and on the ground, thousands joined in the long, frantic wait that turned into a “filthy spree”: 
smell of frying chips, clamors, jostles, whistles, catcalls, clucks, filling the soft springtime night.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a><br><br>

A few months later at a summer spa Herve Alphand met one who had been there: Louis Louis-Dreyfus, 
whom he describes with some hyperbole as the richest man in Europe. Everyone needs a relaxation now and then, Louis
-Dreyfus confided. It had been hard to get up so early, but it was worth it. “Weidmann’s execution 
was edifying, purifying. I did not regret it.” However edifying the saturnalia might have been, a decree 
of June 26 abolished public executions. In July the next murderer to be guillotined, a thirty-four-year
-old mechanic who merely knifed his mother-in-law and wife to death, would have his head cut 
off in a prison courtyard. Pending “scandalous manifestations” on a more grandiose scale, the French would be denied the acrid 
zest of one another’s deaths.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a><br><br>

Meanwhile, the weeks between Weidmann’s trial and his execution had proved eventful. The horoscope of March 16 announced an uncertain 
day “when we risk lapses of judgment and even of good sense . .. many small vexations.” Confirming the predictions, 
on that day Hitler occupied the rump of Czechoslovakia, which had been sacrificed six months before. Smaller vexations came while 
the government dithered over letting the Germans take over the Czech Paris Embassy. Only British ire appears to have prevented their 
finally doing so.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Having accepted humiliation in September 1938, it seems that there was no end to the humble pie 
the democracies, would ingurgitate. On March 22 Lithuania was forced to cede Memel to Germany; on April 7 Mussolini, 
not to be outdone by his ally, invaded Albania. The weekly illustrated Match, featuring the Italian occupation of 
the little kingdom, carried an article on German industry by Bertrand de Jouvenel in which the reporter asked a German officer 
what raw material the Germans found most tempting: “Steel is master of the world. Most tempting for us is the 
iron ore of Polish Silesia and that of French Lorraine. But everything in due course!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a><br><br>

The Spanish war, begun in 1936, was petering out. Barcelona fell in January; in February Franco had been recognized; Spanish 
refugees were streaming across the Pyrenees, creating serious practical problems and concerns even more acute than the material 
difficulties they raised. The president of the Chamber’s Foreign Affairs Committee complained that five hundred thousand had 
arrived in France, only a small proportion of these <b>[p.260]</b> had returned, 
hundreds of thousands remained to be dealt with. “The presence on our territory of numerous foreign elements is not only a 
financial burden, but a serious impediment to public order and national security.” Those who could not be persuaded to 
go back would be parked like cattle in camps not far from the border that became a byword for odious discomfort. 
Over the gate of one, framed between French flags, could be read the inscription: CAMP DE CONCENTRATION DE ST.-CYPRIEN. 
Below that: VIVE LA FRANCE.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a><br><br>

Previous crises had courteously allowed the general public to draw breath from one to the next. Now they tumbled furiously in 
each other’s wake. On March 31, piqued by Bohemia’s demise, Britain guaranteed the territorial integrity of Poland; on 
April 13, after Albania’s fall, Britain and France extended the same guarantee to Romania and Greece. On April 28, 
Hitler, in a torrential speech over three hours long, broke with Poland while threatening it with the worst. On 
April 30 Russia proposed a military alliance against Germany (allied negotiators traveling by sea were to reach Leningrad on August 
10). Then, on the fourth of May, the leftist daily <i>L’OEuvre</i> published an 
explosive article by the Neo-Socialist pacifist Marcel Déat, “Do We Have to Die for Danzig?” To his 
own question Déat returned a loud No! French folk had not the slightest wish to die for “Poldavians” or for anybody 
else. The convoluted conflicts of people far away were not their affair. Why should they lay their lives down for 
them? Nor were the facts at issue simply black or white: Munich had been, in principle at least, 
about the self-determination of Czechoslovakia’s Germans, the Sudeten. Danzig was German, too; the Polish Corridor, 
which cut through German territory to link Danzig with Poland, was a geographical and political aberration. Why should the French 
be dragged into a war they didn’t want, for a cause that on the face of it ought to be peacefully 
settled?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a><br><br>

The desperate urge for peace brought other uncertainties to the fore. The British alliance could prove a broken reed. It 
had done so before, when the British repeatedly failed to support French resistance to German breaches of the Versailles peace. 
In any case, French and British did not get on that well. Plenty of French found little to choose between 
British and Germans. ‘The English get on my nerves,” one of Edmée Renaudin’s neighbors told her in 
May.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> As for a Russian alliance, 
there were certainly those who believed that a pact between France, Britain, and Russia would intimidate Hitler and discourage further 
aggressions on his part. But the guarantees handed to Russia’s neighbors on a platter gave Poland and <b>[p.261]</b> 
Romania support without requiring them to provide facilities for Russian intervention
against Germany. Above everything else, most of the French except the Communists considered Bolsheviks as bad as Nazis, indeed 
worse. Respectable rightists would not sit at the same table as Communists, let alone stand shoulder to shoulder with 
them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> The idea of a war against 
the Germans about some other country’s interests and on the same side as Muscovite predators seemed revolting. Better think again?
<br><br>

In April a Gallup poll had found 51 percent of the American public expecting war that year; by May the proportion 
had fallen to 32 percent. <i>Paris-Soir</i> explained American reasons for relaxing: No 
one on either side had enough money for war. The money would be forthcoming. At mid-May Paul Reynaud’s 
new national defense loan brought in six billion francs six hours.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> 
Even without the Russians, a firm attitude, refusal to make more concessions would prevent further land grabs. The Germans, 
in any case, “were tired of their regime, it wouldn’t survive the war.” The French meanwhile had other 
fish to fry. The 150th anniversary of the Great Revolution evoked appeals — from Herriot among others — to avoid civil 
war. Otherwise it attracted no more attention than the decree-law postponing by two years the general elections due to 
be held in 1940 and thus prolonging the tenure of the present Chamber by two years. The thirty-second cycling 
Tour de France took off without German or Italian riders, to be won by a Belgian. The military parade of 
July 14, in which French and British units marched past in unison, was drenched by showers, and yet the 
crowd was large and enthusiastic.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> That 
same month a national survey revealed that only one in six refused to fight for Danzig, while 76 percent were ready 
to use force in its defense. The silent majority seems to have been less passive and less defeatist than the noisy 
minority.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a><br><br>

July turned out a month of arrests and rumors of arrests designed to scotch German propaganda. But holidays were coming. 
Nobody was sure if they would be interrupted, if passive defense sunglasses would have to be exchanged for more active garb, 
but the August sun saw three million French make for mountains, beaches, or the countryside. Those who could afford 
it trundled with them the newly published translation of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>or else the 
latest number of <i>Femina</i>, more portable than <i>Autant en emporte le vent</i> 
but just as decorative with its predictions of bustles and bows, <i>drapés</i>, <i>poufs</i>, 
facings — more complicated fashions for complicated times.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a><br><br>

The Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 22 drove ritual August features off uninspired front pages: “All Paris on holiday.” 
“At Divonne, the capital of

<b>[p.262]</b> repose, happiness is untroubled.” French Communist leaders too were on
Holiday—Maurice Thorez on the Mediterranean coast, Jacques Duclos in
his native Pyrenees—and <i>L’Humanité</i> still called for a Franco-Russo-British 
Pact. It ignored that Moscow had changed course in the spring, even while
luring on the Westerners it 
distrusted.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> The Nazi-Soviet Pact sealed the
prospect of war. On August 25 reservists only recently released from the
Munich mobilization were being recalled again. The dollar, gaining 10 percent,
reached forty francs. The Communist <i>L’Humanité</i> and <i>Ce Soir</i>, which
had just glorified Russia’s pacific gesture (“Silence to the anti-Soviet
pack!”), were suspended. Censorship came into force, and newspapers
began to appear peppered with blank 
spaces.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a>  Holidaymakers were making
tracks for home. On September 1, while <i>Je Suis Partout</i> headlined A BAS LA 
GUERRE, VIVE LA FRANCE, German troops invaded Poland; on September 2
general mobilization was announced; on September 3 Britain and France
declared war on Germany—the French six hours later than their allies.
That day Herve Alphand marked the first Sunday of the war by lunching at
Larue’s splendiferous restaurant. The following day Anatole de Monzie
noted in his diary: “This Sept 4, France at war does not believe in the
war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a><br><br>
 
That was one way of putting it, and it cut close to the bone. Many of
those who thought that a firm attitude would discourage German aggressiveness
were surprised to find that firmness had not worked. Many felt that
if a war was to be fought, the Germans were the wrong enemy altogether.
Some simply panicked, fighting to get home from Brittany or Savoy, “the
expectation of catastrophe reflected in their faces,” or to get out of cities
slated for destruction: “If you are a mother, your <i>duty</i> is to leave Paris.”
Most simply did their duty, whatever that duty 
was.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a><br><br>

There are as many versions of the mobilization of 1939 as there are of
patriotism in the 1930s or of the Battle of France in 1940. We have accounts
of a mobilization that worked like clockwork, others that stress the
Communists in railway stations yelling, “Don’t go!” and, “Peace! Peace!”
My own impression is close to that of the prefect of the Rhone in Lyons
who, in September 1939, reported “something between resolution and resignation.”
Much of the evidence bears him out, although it leans rather
toward the latter term. “Resignation,” remembers Pierre de Calan, “Resignation,”
echoes Bernard Cazeaux. “Most men are as indifferent to the fate
of Poland as they had been to that of Czechoslovakia. All obeyed but did <b>[p.263]</b> no more than obey. Besides, no one could see the sense of the 
venture. . . .”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> 
Another recurring term is <i>pagaille</i>—a shambles. Calan remembers a prodigious
shambles. So does Léonce Chaleil, a truck driver in an Alpine unit. So
the duc de Brissac.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> 
But large movements of troops and matériel are to be chaotic, and evidence suggests 
that they settled down into the institutionalized “shambolism” of military life.<br><br>

Dispatched to cover the first day of mobilization at the Gare de l’Est,
one journalist returned to his editor reporting no enthusiasm but a resolute
Mood. The editor sighed: “One can see that they have nothing to lose. . . . ” 
That gives a class-cultural sense of the gap between chatterers and the
steady, stoic mass. But of course, it’s more complicated. Coming on the
heels of mobilization and demobilization in September-October 1938, the
call-up of 1939 was taken as a replay that would also end in a settlement.
Reservists, often drunk, lived in the expectation of another Munich. Believing
that he would be back home in a few days, François Bizard, called back
from army leave, did not even bother to say good-bye to his parents. The
anticipated air bombardments never materialized. “Thus far,” William Bullitt
noted on September 8, “a curious unreality about the 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> war.” Perhaps
war itself was a false alarm?<br><br>

Many hoped that it might so prove. Daladier, who had no sympathy for
Poland (“a vulture”) and no confidence in it (“stupid”), expected German
bombardments so terrible that the public would drive him from political
life and probably kill him. But, then, few in government doubted that
things would go badly for Germany’s foes, and events proved them right.
On September 18 Russian troops entered Poland. On September 19, <i>Paris-Soir</i>, 
which had been publishing installments of Agatha Christie’s <i>Ten Little
Niggers</i>, printed the last: “And then there were none.” By the end of the
month Poland had been devoured. The French were unworried. Reynaud
had assured them that victory would be theirs because their side was strongest—
<i>Nous vaincrons parce que nous sommes les plus forts</i>—and the Stock Exchange
held fast. So did the army, ready and formidable, but not to be 
risked in mere fighting, as Giraudoux explained to the American Club in a
lecture entitled “Why We Make a War, and Why We Do Not Make 
It.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a><br><br>

The second alternative was more evident than the first. If the songs that 
People sing or listen to with pleasure are anything to go by, resignation
reigned. The song heard everywhere was a mopey romance, “J’attendrai. . . ,”
while attempts to strike up “Marseillaise” or “Madelon” evoked <b>[p.263]</b>
derisive hoots, at least in soldiers’ cafés. One of the winter’s great successes was
a ditty that Maurice Chevalier sang at the Casino de Paris, depicting the
French Army as a mirror image of French society:<br><br>

<blockquote>
<i>Le colonel était d’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Action Française</a>,<br>

The colonel an <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Action Française</a> royalist,<br>

</blockquote>

There wasn’t really that much marching to get used to. Mobilization
soon turned into general immobilization. Five million men had been called
up, a quarter of the male population, most of whom had nothing to do after 
four or five in the afternoon, little enough during the rest of the day. Their
main concern became how to get out of uniform or, at least, out of the
lines. “The war,” noted a staff lieutenant on November 7, “we don’t think
of it.” The bombing, the gassing, the microbes, all the nightmares of previous
years seemed to have been set aside along with peace. The press talked
about a war of nerves, but nerves had been more on edge before September
than they were during the following 
months.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a><br><br>

The archbishop of Besançon denounced a disquieting situation: No 
great battles, few dead or wounded; “many seem to forget that we are at 
<b>[p.265]</b> war.” Many, of course, would rather that they weren’t. Joseph Peschadour, 
Socialist deputy of Corrèze, asked his neighbor Monzie, in the government, 
do something about it: “Is there a war? Are we at war?” Wasn’t the state 
of war a formality to be brought to an end? Failing a declaration of peace, 
politicians acted as if business were normal; parliamentary commissions 
discussed the possible abolition of first-class compartments in passenger 
trains, worried about the winter sports industry and the winter season on 
the Côte d’Azur, proposed replacing puttees with leather leggings. In October 
1939 the General Staff, dissatisfied with the fare it was getting, posted 
all available chefs in uniform to its quarters at Meaux. “<i>Enfin, nous allions avoir 
des chefs</i>.” If people knew how their war was run, Daladier confided to his 
friends at dinner, they would have thrown us into the Seine long 
ago.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a><br><br>

How should they know? Why should they care? The press was reassuring 
or else silent. Censorship prevented untoward hostility to the Germans, 
prohibited articles arguing for the Reich’s dismemberment or suggesting 
that Hitler was a bloody fool, excluded references to an anti-Fascist war in 
case Mussolini’s feelings should be hurt.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[*]</a> 
Paris was much more pleasant; the traffic was light; a lot of shops had closed as during the holidays, then 
opened again with little sense of a change. Confectioners sold boxes shaped 
like gas masks but containing sweets. Stationers stocked packets of small 
flags of all nations, including that of the enemy with its black swastika on a 
white ground. Horse races suspended at the start of hostilities started again. 
Wages and prices had been frozen as of September 1, I939, but prices were 
creeping up while the minister of agriculture refused to restrict consumption. 
Wartime rationing would only be introduced two months before the 
Germans attacked. Edgar Ansel Mowrer, the war correspondent, returning 
to Paris at the end of winter, described a restaurant meal on a day of food 
restrictions when he did not expect to find much to eat: “a choice between 
seven kinds of oysters, six or seven kinds of fish including bouillabaisse, no 
butcher’s meat (veal, mutton, beef) and no sausages, ‘only’ rabbit, chicken 
and curry; vegetable hors d’oeuvres, caviar, anchovies, sardines; no pastries, 
cakes or candy, but choice between fruit salad, pineapple with kirsch and 
<i>soufflé à la liqueur</i>. Thanks to a couple of fairly decent wines, we managed to 
get this sort of thing down.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> 
No wonder Mowrer wondered whether the country was at war.<br><br>

“Sheltered behind the Maginot Line,” explained <i>Paris-Soir</i> on January 1, 
1940, “the nation is safe and working much as usual.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a>
Cinemas, bars, and <i>dancings</i> did a brisk trade. The Dutch were debating whether their national 
painters should paint flowers on their fortifications. The French football 
team defeated Portugal 3-2. Opinion settled into the belief that there 
would be no war or that the war would be won without any fighting.[*] For 
months the most visible signs of war had appeared in fashion: sober costumes, 
shorter skirts, epaulets, pajamas and overalls designed for shelter 
wear, the slate blue of the RAF as a favorite color. Models bore martial 
names: Spahi for a Lanvin suit, Camouflage for a Schiaparelli coat. Schiaparelli 
excelled herself, turning out “air raid suits, lastex elastic waists for ‘fat 
and lean years,’ <i>culottes</i> for cycling, skirts with enormous pockets, dresses 
with built-in muffs for queuing in the cold, prints representing ration cards, 
coupons, schedules: Monday—no meat, Tuesday—no alcohol, Wednesday—
no butter, Thursday—no fish, Friday—no meat, Saturday—no alcohol, 
but Sunday—<i>toujours l’amour</i>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a><br><br>

Not everyone who read <i>Gone with the Wind</i> was troubled by its tale of 
victory of a more populous, industrial North over the less developed South 
which suggested that Germany might be expected to triumph over France 
for similar reasons. They might have been more troubled by the pacifist 
epilogue to Roger Martin du Gard’s <i>Les Thibault</i>, published in January 1940 
and by the dying hero’s last jottings: “Not acceptance. Indifference. Exhaustion 
that cancels revolt. Reconciliation with the inevitable .... Peace. 
Let it end. . . . It’s simpler than one thinks.” It was.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a><br><br>

The Germans worked hard to destabilize the country and weaken what 
will for war there was. From July 1939 France had been peppered with 
brochures and tracts arguing Germany’s case, calling for peace, reminding 
those who needed a reminder that Britain, once again, was ready to fight to 
the last Frenchman. “The French risk their lives, the British their machines,” 
went the German jingle. It worked quite well. An army of wine 
bibbers meshed badly with one that guzzled tea. The British were too well 
off: Their higher pay, their enviable Players cigarettes, their whiskey irritated. 
“Anglophobia appears practically general in the French Army,” 
noted Claude Jamet without much regret. All the songs about entente cordiale 
<b>[p.266]</b> to the contrary, “we cannot find much sympathy for each other. These 
people are more foreign, they seem more far away than the Chinese.’’ German 
radio broadcasts beamed to France from Stuttgart were more effective 
still. French radio programs never were much good; news bulletins were 
soon dismissed as vapid and unreliable. Listeners got into the habit of tuning 
in to the BBC or else to Radio Stuttgart.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a>
That was the fault of the Information Service, created in July 1939 and headed by Jean Giraudoux.<br><br>

Delay in setting up a Department of Information bears witness to laudable 
reluctance to manage news and broadcast propaganda. It also inevitably 
resulted in the sort of disorder that newly set-up enterprises always face 
before they find their feet, and the disorder affected a crucial aspect of the 
war effort—or, rather, the nonwar effort. The Nazi propaganda machine 
had been perfected since the early thirties; the French never got a start. 
Giraudoux hated Nazis far less than he disliked the ruthless materialism of 
industrial Germany, far from the old-world charm of the small-scale France 
he cherished. He had no talent for vulgar propaganda, no mind for administration. 
His new department became a can of worms full of export rejects: 
retired officers and diplomats, professors, unemployed journalists, opportunists 
of limited talent who did not know how to catch—and hold—the 
general public’s ear. Their leader—that delicate spirit, Georges Bernanos 
had led him—was no better. As a country postman wrote back from the 
lines, “It’s unendurable. Risk, cold, boredom, but for goodness’ sake 
more phrases like those of Giraudoux.” Personnel was defeatist. Morale 
bad. The <i>commissaire général à l’information</i> himself was hardly optimistic: 
“One prepares for war as one prepares for an exam. We shall not pass this
One.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a><br><br>

One of Giraudoux’ s broadcasts had to be devoted to praising the Alsatian 
dialect “that one could hear at this moment [November 10, 1939] in 
the schools and markets of the Périgord or the Saintonge.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a>
Large numbers of Alsatians and some Lorrainers had been evacuated from the combat 
zone to safer venues inland—safer, but not more comforting. Alsatians and 
some Lorrainers traditionally spoke their own Germanic dialects, which 
stirred the inland French antipathy for boches since long before the war. 
Translated to Franche-Comté and to Dauphiné, to center and southwest, 
Alsatian and Lorrainer evacuees were regarded as intruders at best, <i>schleuhs</i> 
and boches at worst, and “treated like dirt.” Despite official reminders that 
they were really French, the womenfolk of local servicemen made sure they 
did not think that they were as good as they. Reports from Vienne, from 
<b>[p.268]</b> Besançon, from Périgueux describe their shoddy treatment of 
the evacuees.” Some blamed them for the war: “If Hitler declared [sic] war, it 
is because he wants to get back 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Alsace-Lorraine</a>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a><br><br>

If anything, the menfolk serving in the evacuated zones behaved still worse. In 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Lorraine</a> Claude Jamet noted “the systematic pillage of all evacuated villages 
occupied by troops.” Keeping his <i>War Diary</i> in the autumnal Alsatian 
countryside, Jean-Paul Sartre noted what he was told: “In the evacuated districts 
over towards Sarreguemines [Moselle], the soldiers billeted there have smashed 
everything, crapped in their beds, broken into the cupboards with axes: There’s 
a real obsession with evacuation and looting at Brumath . . .  evacuation to them 
means looting.” And here’s the colonel’s driver describing what he has seen: 
“Mirrors smashed on the wardrobes; pieces of furniture split by bayonet-strokes; 
bed-linen looted — what couldn’t be carried away is torn. The tiles on the roof 
are smashed, the silverware has disappeared. In the cellars the lads drank what 
they could and then, when they could drink no more, went off leaving the spigots 
of the barrels open; the cellar is flooded with wine. A sewing-machine is split 
in two. By axe-blows? And yet it was cast iron, says Klein (the driver) 
sadly.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a><br><br>

Irresponsible soldiers, nomadic military units tend to act destructively. But 
mayhem on this scale testifies to lack of discipline magnified by prejudice and 
by prejudicial tales whose truth is less relevant than the frame of mind that 
generated them. In the evacuated <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Lorraine</a> village near the German border that 
Pierre de Calan’ s infantry unit occupied they found swastikas and portraits of 
Hitler.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> Passing through 
Burgundy in September 1939, a train of Alsatian evacuees halted at Paray-le-Monial 
was observed to have blankets with swastikas hanging to dry at the windows. Fights 
between servicemen attempting to drag off the Nazi blankets and Alsatians determined 
to recover their property only broke up when the troop trains made a precipitate 
departure. How much of this was true, how much was rumor inspired by prejudice or 
meant to justify it?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> 
Enough that the tales were there. On both sides. It 
is small consolation after this to read <i>The New Yorker’s</i> A. J. Liebling after 
visit to evacuated Strasbourg, eerily empty of people: “[M]ilitary police put up a 
Christmas tree for the abandoned pigeons of the cathedral: a tiny balsam surrounded 
by bread crumbs.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a><br><br>

Here was an opportunity for popular education, missed or addressed only with half a 
heart. Other activities of the Information Office seem to have been to scale, limited 
to what had been long denounce as brainwashing — <i>bourrage de crâne</i>. But war 
propaganda does not consist of treating <b>[p.269]</b> adults like children, feeding 
them slogans and patriotic pap. There was nothing wrong with collecting scrap iron and 
chronicling sporting events, even when the British beat the French 36-3 at 
rugby.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> But a people at war must be 
prepared for danger, for effort, for exertions of will. Giraudoux and his kind were not 
made for taking serious things seriously or talking about them in simple, accessible 
terms. The nonevents of the eight months after September did not help. It was hard to 
keep minds fixed on a war that did not happen, and the first to find more pressing matters 
engaging their attention were the leaders of the war that was so hard to find.<br><br>


A NATION is often more at peace when it’s at war. But the phony war was accompanied by 
an internal peace that was just as phony. Business as usual, or almost as usual, in the 
country at large reflected politics as usual: intraparty and intracabinet squabbles.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier’s</b></a> government of national 
unity was badly disunited, and the worst friction within it took place between its leading 
personalities, Reynaud 
and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> 
Outside the cabinet also there was less 
fighting between French and Germans than between French and French, prewar disputes continuing 
unappeased between Left and Right, but also within each side, each with its bellicists, its 
pacifists, its defeatists.<br><br>

Most of the destructive activity, however, seems to have been focused on the Communists. 
The German-Soviet Pact justified the worst fears of those who always questioned the national 
loyalty of Communist party members, and Communists did their best to confirm this, conducting 
a counterwar of stickers, flyers, tracts, underground publications, oral propaganda, all of 
which called for peace at once and denounced the imperialist war. For the patriots of <i>Gringoire</i> 
who called for death to the Communist traitors, communism was the number one enemy, the Communists 
were a foreign army camping on French soil. A more attractive crusade was partly displacing a war 
respectable folks doubted.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a><br><br>

Already busy with Spanish republican refugees, police and gendarmerie were set to hunting 
Communist subversives and then left-wingers identified with the Communists. Given priorities 
that they could understand, spurred by ministerial circulars, aided by volunteer informers, the 
forces of order bent their energy to the chase. Their quarries often turned out to be like the 
alleged Communist of Saint-Céré, accused of hanging a red flag from his window, which turned out 
to be a rag that signaled for the baker to deliver <b>[p.270]</b> bread. Then — divine confirmation — 
came the Soviet attack on Finland on November 30, 1939. This enabled, as the combative 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-500"><b>Kérillis</b></a> put it in the Chamber, former 
apologists for the Nazis to try to turn the war into an anti-Stalinist crusade. The government, 
hesitant about making war on the Germans, was being pressed to make war on the Russians first. There 
was talk of an attack on the Caucasus and of bombing Russian oilfields at Baku that supplied Hitler’s 
war. When on March 1, 1940, the Finns asked for a hundred bombers and fifty thousand men, 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a> agreed. A British diplomat in Paris 
noted that the French contingent was ready to start off. If Swedes and Norwegians refused passage, the 
Allies should “make a forcible entry.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a><br><br>

The Finns preferred to sign an armistice with their aggressors, and 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a>, who had failed to outface either of 
France’s foes, was driven to resignation. As in March11936 and March 1938, in March 1940 the country 
faced a foreign crisis whilst in a cabinet crisis. Reynaud was confirmed by 268 votes against 267 opposed 
or abstaining. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a> continued in the cabinet 
as minister of war. Within two weeks the German invasion of Denmark and Norway started. On May 9, in the 
wake of the Norwegian fiasco, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a> announced 
he would give up the War portfolio. The following day war was to begin at last. Bertrand de Jouvenel would 
find it stupefying that “a great power, at a decisive moment of its destiny, should be as if struck by 
immobility.” It isn’t, said Jouvenel, that no one noticed what was going on. It is that all were busy watching 
each other, “their vigilance absorbed by internal strife.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a><br><br>

ON SEPTEMBER 3, 1939, Second Lieutenant Jacques Delmas, twenty-four-years old and straight out of officer 
school at Saint-Cyr, was issued a staff map that showed the north and northeast border and Germany all the 
way to Berlin. He found the troops idle and dreary, the officers so little in command that they would cross 
the street to avoid groups of enlisted men they knew would not salute them. Pierre Andreu, a quartermaster 
sergeant in a Senlis barracks, describes a formless mass obsessively in quest of a soft job or hurrying to 
get their wives pregnant if they could, to gain brownie points toward demobilization: two years’ seniority 
for every child. Second Lieutenant Hubert Beuve-Méry, commanding a company at the north end of the Maginot 
Line, considered the war lost: <i>La guerre est foutue</i>. American visitors to the Second Army in the 
same area (Meuse, Ardennes) were struck <b>[p.271]</b> by their interlocutors’ insistence on the troops’ 
high morale. “It occurred to Col. Budd and me that since it was the occasion for so much comment it might 
not be as good as it’s alleged to be. The men at the front presented a rather sorry spectacle of discomfort 
and dejection.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a><br><br>

Sartre was more discriminating. Up in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Alsace</a>, he found the war “elusive,”  life full of rumors, comrades 
deadly bored. He himself escaped boredom by reading and especially writing: notebooks, letters, about a 
million words in a few months. The infantrymen he talked to had been determined in the fall, but resolution 
seeped away through the long months of inaction.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>  We 
hear of equipment lacking through the long, hard winter, but most seem to have been comfortable enough. 
The meat consumption of the 3,300,000 men of the military zone was seven times that of German soldiers,  
four times that of Britain. Bullitt, returning from a visit to the Maginot Line, found 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-281"><b>Daladier</b></a> harassed and enervated and advised him 
that he should go to the front to rest. He would find calm, order, cleanliness, plump soldiers, well kempt, 
keeping their weapons and their uniforms neat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> And 
bored. No sports, no games, no physical education, as far as one can tell from the newspapers, but a lot 
of drinking. The wine ration — half liter (about one pint) a day-had been raised by a quarter liter on 
January 1. Every day, 2,500,000 liters of wine for the services were shipped and distributed: alcohol for 
an alcoholic nation under arms. Further lickerish  floods flowed from a patriotic enterprise dear to the 
hearts of vintners and of their parliamentary representatives: supplies of free hot wine to warm  the troops 
in winter, <i>le vin chaud du soldat</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a>
 But spirits did not improve the spirit.<br><br>

By February 1940 the tone of Sartre’ s notes has changed. Men who once complained about their comrades’ 
inclination to heroics now say that their mates’ morale is low. “It’s what I’ve had occasion to observe 
everywhere lately.” The men are fed up with doing nothing. They predict collapse. “If things go on this 
way,” one declared, “without any fighting, we’ll be having a revolution and it’ll start with the Army.” 
This change in attitude is echoed by other evidence. In September 1939 Roger Goetze, commanding an 
artillery unit in the mountains above Briançon, quoted his sergeant major: “We didn’t want this war . . . 
it’s not our business but we are at war, you are our leader, you order and we’ll follow.” A few months 
later, when there is talk of moving the position: “Don’t do it, you can’t do it, we’ve had enough, we want 
to go home, and we wouldn’t follow if you try to do it.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a><br><br>

Testimony about the spring of 1940 paints a somber picture of depression <b>[p.272]</b> and defeatism 
among commissioned and noncommissioned officers, as in the other ranks. The men, Sartre recorded, had 
no patriotic ideal to sustain them; none had been inculcated in the past score years. They knew they did 
not like Hitler or his ideas; but Poland meant nothing to them, and fighting for democracy meant little 
more. They carried out their duty and hoped they could get home soon, but the one became increasingly 
meaningless and the other increasingly distant. One way their disaffection expressed itself was against 
officers. French soldiers interned in Switzerland after the fighting expressed bitterness against officers 
and noncoms. So did the light infantry types whom Sartre quotes: restrained but profound hatred, talk of 
bumping them off, anger, contempt. It is possible that elite units maintained better morale; it is probable 
that most men were never asked for the efforts that would have raised their morale; it is likely that distance 
in conditions and relations between ranks aggravated class frictions. The conclusion is hard to avoid that 
the long months of inaction during which a great war machine was left to run in neutral sapped what resolution 
there had been and prepared the rout to come.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a><br><br>

<i>Marie-Claire</i>’s horoscope for May 10, 1940, was hardly encouraging: “We shall be subject to austere, 
indeed grim astral influences. Hostile to tender hearts, they will be propitious to the cold and calculating . . .” 
Just before dawn that forbidding Friday the cold and calculating Germans attacked Luxembourg, Holland, and 
Belgium. The real war had begun. It would not last long. Within three days German armor had crossed the Meuse 
River. The Dutch capitulated on May 15, the Belgians on the twenty-seventh. That night the Paris Opera offered 
the first performance of Darius Milhaud’s <i>Medea</i>. “The music,” Simone de Beauvoir noted, “seemed very 
beautiful.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> A week later Dunkirk, from which over 330,000 
troops had been evacuated by the Royal Navy, also fell, and on June 6 scratch defensive lines on the Somme were 
broken through. The Comedie Française put on a play, <i>On ne saurait penser</i> a tout (You can’t think of 
everything). The Germans entered Paris on June 14.<br><br>

All this time rumors were rife: toxic balloons, poisonous bonbons, fifth columnists disguised as nuns or postmen, 
parachutists dropping from the skies. War correspondents, British airmen escaped lynching by the skin of their 
teeth. The censorship cut the running head of <i>Je Suis Partout</i>, which proclaimed LA PATRIE EN DANGER, but 
Gamelin’s order of the day ordered the troops to win or die.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> 
Most of them found both alternatives too dire.<br><br>

Going into combat near Stenay, a few miles from Sedan, Pierre de Calan <b>[p.273]</b> recalls seeing with his own 
eyes the spot where the Maginot Line and its antitank defenses stopped, respectful of the Belgian border: “<i>Je 
reste halluciné</i>.” His division, Calan concludes, fought well but proved frighteningly powerless. Like everybody 
else. The generals blamed the men. French troops, Gamelin’s number two man told a British air marshal, “were not 
fighting as they should. Seven months of inactivity had weakened their fighting spirit.” Whose fault was that? But 
the sixty-eight-year-old Gamelin, though badly shaken and increasingly depressed, could not be sacked in the midst 
of battle,  or so it was alleged. By May 20 the generalissimo, known to his troops as Gamelin, was out, replaced by 
the seventy-three-year-old Maxime Weygand.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a><br><br>

Foreign embassies were sending their womenfolk off to safe billets. Ambassador Bullitt proclaimed the morale of 
French Army and civilians “a vast credit to the human race.”* But refugees flooding southward and wounded soldiers 
returning from the front spread tales of muddle and defeat. A week after German tanks rolled through the impassable 
Ardennes, Reynaud had called on the country to forge itself a new heart, now, at once. Easier said than done when he 
and his fellow leaders expected only the worst. Both Paul Reynaud and Georges Mandel, newly appointed minister of the 
interior,  reported Bullitt, “expect a Communist uprising and butcheries in the city of Paris and other industrial 
centers as the German Army draws near.” Could the Americans send tommy guns to fight the Communists off? Two days after 
this, the same dispatch that deemed morale a credit to the human race spoiled its effect by repeating: “Everyone here 
believes (from Mandel to Herriot) that the moment the French Government leaves Paris the Communists of the industrial 
suburbs will seize the city, and will be permitted to murder, loot and burn for several days before the Germans come 
in.” Shades of Bazaine!<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a><br><br>
Happily, predictions of this sort were not publicized. Whilst evacuation proceeded at Dunkirk, Parisians took life 
calmly. The outdoor stamp market functioned as usual on the Champs-Elysees; children watched Punch and Judy shows 
or rode old donkeys through the sunny alleys. British observers were exasperated: “They should be digging trenches 
or doing <b>[p.274]</b> something ... we’ll end by having to fight Germany alone.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a> The French, at least, were not alone. The saints were on their 
side. On May 19 Reynaud who publicly declared his faith in miracles, attended public prayers held at Notre Dame; on the 
twenty-sixth the relics of Saint Genevieve, who had saved Paris before, were solemnly carried in procession; on the 
thirty-first, at the Basilica of the Sacré Coeur, France was reconsecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Old canticles 
abandoned by a disenchanted age were being dusted off for the emergency:<br><br>

<blockquote><i>Dieu de clémence<br>O Dieu vainqueur,<br>Sauvez, sauvez la France<br>Au nom du Sacré-Coeur.</i><br><br>
God of clemency<br>God of victory,<br>Save, save your France<br>In the name of the Sacred Heart.</blockquote>
<br><br>
On June 2 a party of General Motors executives visiting the headquarters of the general commanding the Paris air 
defense found morale to be of the best. Before a delicious lunch with the general and his staff, who were housed 
in a large chateau, they heard that the Germans could be stopped with five hundred more fighter planes and six 
hundred more tanks. On June 7 the last number of <i>Je Suis Partout</i> to appear before the Occupation featured 
an article by Thierry Maulnier, “The Miracle of Flanders,” that prophesied forthcoming victory. On June 6 the 
French front had been broken on the Somme, but the French believed themselves entitled to miracles.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a><br><br>

Miracles, unfortunately, favored the Germans, not the French. The battle in the air was lost in the first forty-eight 
hours, expectably when we
remember with what determination the air arm had been kept at heel. Less than 80,000 airmen in all, counting hardly 
4,000 flying personnel in France and about one third the aircraft that the Luftwaffe disposed of, hamstrung by 
battle principles that played down attack in favor of ground support, the air force was a Cinderella. Airmen 
fought like lions, but they were outmatched despite the equally heroic efforts of their British allies. Figures 
differ, but it seems that in the end the Allies downed two German planes for every three they lost. Henri 
Amouroux shows RAF losses in the Battle of France as 1,526 men killed and wounded, 959 planes lost; French 
ones as 1,493 killed and wounded, and 1,200 or 1,300 planes lost. Extraordinary sacrifices, but to no avail. 
When, a few months later, American observers tried to explain the collapse in the air, they rejected the 
excuse of numerical inferiority — itself attributable to faulty planning — and blamed the <b>[p.275]</b> 
generals: “[The] head men were too politically-minded; they shared the selfishness and jealousy of the Army 
and Navy commanders; they found it too easy to procrastinate and, above all, they never really believed that 
the war would come in their time.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> Harsh words and in part 
unjust, but defeat is a ruthless judge.
The air force at least put up a good fight. The record on the ground was less honorable, but here, again, it hinged 
on minds that lagged behind the times.
Numerically, French armor matched and overmatched the enemy.* But in the High Command no one understood the new 
mechanized warfare; no one could cope with its speed or adjust the lessons learned in the First World War to the 
Napoleonic tactics of the Germans. Army engineers seemed to have never heard of road mines, land mines, field mines, 
mine barriers against tanks. Artillerymen, handicapped by horse traction, had argued long and hard that antitank 
weapons would prove more powerful than tanks, then neglected to acquire enough of them. Infantry, short of trucks, 
had to march to battle and engage the enemy when weary and on the wrong foot. Summing up the situation in  his 
brilliant <i>Les Français de l’an 40</i> (The French of 1940), Jean-Louis Cremieux-Brilhac rehearses the army’s 
shortcommgs: aviation inferior in number and quality; armor adequate in quality and quantity but handicapped by 
limited range, poor armament, and radio equipment, above all by the way it was used; inferior and insufficient 
antitank and antiaircraft weapons; inferior or nonexistent means of communication. “Collapse of doctrine, impotence 
of leadership, crisis of equipment.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a><br><br>

Writing two months after these doings, an American captain compared the German army with a great football team: 
“a powerful line (heavy tanks), a lightning backfield (mechanized units), and splendid interference (bombing planes).” 
The metaphor must have come easily to Americans, for A. J. Liebling also called on it:<br><br>

<blockquote>It must have been a little like one of those football games in which one team seems certain in advance 
to beat the other by two or three touchdowns, but in which the inferior team plays far below its form. The worse 
the poor devils muck things up, the more confidently the destined victors play, and the result is an unwarranted 
score. . . . After such a game, the spectators always think the winning team much stronger than it really is and 
the losers weaker than they possibly could have been.</blockquote><br><br>

Edmee Renaudin’s uncle Jean could not be as detached: ‘The bastards, he said, the bastards, the idiots! To have 
brought us to this!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a><br><br>

The French, it seems, had never heard of getting there firstest with the mostest. And there again Zola’ s words 
ring true: “Why this almost general ignorance, this inferiority of our leaders, so perfectly brave, who had to 
retreat the ones after the others, without even seeming to understand? They found themselves disarmed, and one 
must add that all went to pieces in their hands, the materiel insufficient and inferior, the troops ... poisoned 
by a ferment of indiscipline, unsettled, incapable of victory.” If that happened, it was because they prepared 
it. But if the war was lost, the defeat was still theirs to win.<br><br>

Soon all agreed that if France lost, it was that it had been betrayed. The Russians had betrayed it by signing 
with the Germans; the Germans treacherously had signed their pact with Russia; the Communist party betrayed when 
it chose loyalty to Moscow over the fatherland; the Belgians betrayed when they capitulated; the British had let 
it down by going home rather than stay to fight and lose in France; metics and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">Jews</a> had sapped the country’s 
strength. The army had been treacherously entailed: “never beaten or discouraged,” simply let down. When, as the 
<i>Times</i> of London had asked on November 9, 1870, “when will French soldiers learn to say: we are beaten, and 
not we are betrayed?”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a><br><br>

People had begun to trickle out of Paris at the end of May. After the Germans crossed the Somme, they really 
began to pack. The army was pulling out of the capital, leaving behind hundreds of cars, trucks, guns, new and 
unused, that Germans would find handy in later campaigns elsewhere. Uniformed stragglers passed through the 
streets, ragged, dispirited, some of them drunk. By June 10 evacuation had turned into a general <i>sauve qui 
peut</i>. Six or seven million men, women, children were taking to the roads throughout the country, three quarters 
of the population of Paris among them. Cities like Troyes and Chartres were left practically empty in the mindless 
flight; tens of thousands of children were lost on the roads. Virginia Cowles, the reporter, described the gigantic 
civilian exodus in which she joined on June 11, “the first <i>mechanized</i> evacuation in history,” crawling 
<b>[p.277]</b> southward at about three miles an hour. An Englishman who had been unable to secure a car bought 
one of the last bikes still for sale and got out of Paris on June 14. He noted drinking and drunk poilus and soldiers 
looting empty villages along the road. Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, part of the same crowd, observed that in the midst 
of chaos one ritual continued to be observed: When it was time for meals, everyone 
stopped.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a><br><br>

The military meanwhile were dissolving. Units wandered aimlessly, sent from pillar to post or facing the wrong 
way. Some welcomed leadership; others shunned it. Some looked for action, others fled. <i>Quand ils reculeront</i>, 
Cocteau had observed, <i>ils ne reculeront devant rien</i> (When they start to retreat, they’ll retreat before 
nothing).* Defeat justified defeatism. At Gueret in the Creuse, far from the line of fire, Désiré Arnaud, who was 
trying to administer  the department, was astonished by the number of senior officers heading south without their 
troops. When the Italians bombed the undefended country town, killing I06 and leaving more than 300 wounded, he was 
glad that the mayor of Fontainebleau had thought to bring along the little town’s fire company in his retreat, but 
found that all the medical officers of a military hospital also passing through had fled. Members of a profession 
that fought so brilliantly against competing metics did not show as much energy or dedication when it came to minding 
wounded. They ran.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a><br><br>

Facing the enemy involved unexpected risks when the enemy was always where one expected it. More than one officer 
trying to put up a fight was shot by his own men. Others were overborne or murdered by civilians eager to avoid 
trouble. At Montargis the mayor, backed by his fellow citizens, routed a captain trying to defend the town. At 
Châteauroux the mayor tried to disarm passing troops that belied the white flags with which he bedecked his city. 
At Vierzon an officer who insisted on defending the outskirts “was killed by the populace which wished to prevent 
the destruction of the town.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> Meanwhile, at Saumur, fifty-one 
cadets of the cavalry school and of Saint-Maixent nearby died trying to defend the passage of the Loire. Ernst Jünger 
found the French officers unimpressive; but twice as many officers died in these weeks as men, and twelve general 
officers laid down their lives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[64]</a> Even so, the bravery, initiative, 
or foolhardiness of some <b>[p.278]</b> could not make up for years of indecisiveness and intellectual idleness let 
alone for anachronism among the leadership.<br><br>

On Sunday, June 16, near Falaise in Normandy, Jacques LeRoy Ladurie ran into the villagers of Damblainville, the priest 
reading his breviary, the sexton carrying the cross before them. “I had never seen such a procession, mixing handcarts 
and bicycles, young and old, faithful and miscreants, men and women, cats and dogs .. . on the way to I know not what 
pilgrimage.” The abbé Valdour explained that they were just <i>going</i> -- “we don’t want to
be boches” -- and refused to listen to Le Roy Ladurie’ s pleas to turn back home. “They go on their way singing 
canticles.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a><br><br>

That day, at Bordeaux, Reynaud resigned to be replaced by Philippe Pétain. On the seventeenth Pétain sued for an armistice. 
The British ambassador, Sir Ronald Campbell, had gone to see the marshal earlier in the day and found him completely gaga -- 
an exaggeration, clearly, since Henri Dumoulin, head of the old gentleman’s cabinet, remembered that “he had good moments 
in the mornings.” But, gaga or not, Pétain’ s decision came as a great 
relief.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a><br><br>

Pierre Andreu’s cavalry regiment was in the Vendee by then. “My pain was not shared by my comrades, my squadron felt no 
humiliation. The men jumped with joy .. .. ‘So, it’s over!’ “ In the villages the end of fighting came as a deliverance: 
“[O]ne felt such a shambles, such a rout, it was clear that everything was lost; so just as well capitulate rather than 
get oneself killed for nothing, like pigeons.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> Bourgeoisie, upper 
classes felt very much the same with but few exceptions. At Brive the Social Christian Edmond Michelet produced the 
first tracts calling for resistance on the seventeenth, the day before Brigadier General Charles de Gaulle’s radio 
appeal from London. At Chartres that same day Jean Moulin, prefect of Eure-et-Lair, attempted suicide. In Paris Thierry 
de Martel, a distinguished physician, carried it off. But gestures of this sort were few and far between. As a friend of 
the due de Brissac remarked, “the French have understood: in 1914-1918, 100,000 prisoners, one and a half million dead, 
in 1940 the opposite: 100,000 dead, one and a half million prisoners.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> 
It wasn’t quite like that: Nearly a hundred thousand dead in six weeks is comparable to the death rate suffered at Verdun, 
and five Frenchmen fell for every two Germans. So people fought, or at least they died. But that was the lesson, the 
explanation, the common understanding of those six deadly weeks. That, and a short-lived legend of German invincibility.<br><br>

Only the British refused to understand. “<i>Everyone</i> at Vichy, whatever their <b>[p.279]</b> political views, was 
convinced that they would fold.” There were few in France who, if and when they thought, did not think like Vichy. The 
Germans behaved correctly, harmed no one, paid for their purchases in cash. The three cannon shots of June 26 announcing 
the official end of hostilities were welcome, but the country had laid down its arms at least a week before. <i>Paris-Soir</i> 
(a German-controlled edition) suggested what the summer should be about: couture, aperitifs, and shopping. On July 6 the Casino 
de Paris reopened its portals to the public. On the stage door a new notice hung: ENTRANCE PROHIBITED TO DOGS AND 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">JEWS</a>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a>

<br><br>*An American war correspondent expressed a different view. Returning to England from France in June, Robert Nixon 
of the International News Service described British morale as very high (they stood and fought against any odds and 
counterattacked at any opportunity) and that of the French as low (they would not stand up to tank and mortar fire and would 
not counterattack). NA, 2015-1271/15, June 24, 1940. Diversity is the gist of war. <br><br>

*James M. Laux observes that in May I 940 the French Army had more than double the number of wheeled vehicles than the Germans. 
Also more tanks ( 4,638 against the enemy’s 4,060) with thicker armor and heavier guns, hence almost double the armor tonnage 
of the Germans. <i>The European Automobile Industry</i> (New York , 1992), 146-47.<br><br>

*In a note dated June 1, 1940, Georges Sadoul described the pillage and chaos that accompanied the retreat from the Somme: “an 
army of drunks commanded by sots” (<i>armée d’ivrognes conduite par des saoulards</i>) in which more casualties came from drink 
than from Germans and more armament was abandoned to carry demiohns than was lost in action. <i>Journal de guerre</i> (1977), 
258-59. Sadoul’s division appears to have borne itself well; hence, probably, his indignation.<br><br>

*In November 1939 Simone de Beauvoir, visiting Sartre at Brumath, not far from 
Strasbourg, notes: “Sartre is persuaded that there will be no fighting, that it will be 
a modern war without massacres as modern painting is without subject, music without 
melody, physics without matter.” <i>Journal de guerre</i>, 122.<br><br>

Don Quixote charging a windmill, with fat Göring as Sancho in attendance. B.D.I.C. Phototèque, Paris.<br><br>

Alsatian evacuees were obviously unhappy in the Périgord and may have reacted with minor provocations; on the other hand, Jacques Godechot, teaching in Strasbourrg in 1933, remembered the penetration of Nazism in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Alsace</a> of those days, and the notice on the door of a famous Strasbourg restaurant: “<i>Interdit aux chiens et aux juifs</i>.” In <i>Jules Isaac</i> (1979), 81.<br><br>

Liebling, <i>The Road Back</i>. 31, finds only one man in Paris who predicts disaster, an American who had served in the Foreign Legion and who said that the army was rotten “because the officers were afraid to work the men too hard . . . it would collapse at the first push.” As Colonel Larpent, the <i>Action française</i>’s military columnist, grumbled, “The absinthe army was a good deal better.” Pierre Gaxotte, <i>Les Autres et moi</i> (1975), 176.
