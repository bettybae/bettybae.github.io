	<b>Mystery Document 2</b><br><br>
	<b>The French in Indochina: The Conquest of Tonkin by a French Officer (1892)</b><br><br>
The region known under the name of French Indo-China includes four different countries: Tonkin in the north, Annam in the center, Cochinchina and Cambodge in the south. The coasts of Indo-China form the general shape of an S, Tonkin occupies the concave top, Annam middle part and Cochinchina the convex bottom. It would take too long to start here a detailed geographical description of these four countries; so we will limit ourselves to the statement of the essential concepts needed to understand the operations executed by the French in Indo-China.<br><br>
Tonkin is formed by the delta of the Red River and Thai-Binh, Cochinchina by the delta of the Me-Kong and Dong-Na, and Annam, which brings the two together, is a long strip of land extending nearly a thousand kilometers, bounded on the east by the sea, and to the west by a great mountain range roughly parallel to the sea, from which it is removed by a distance varying from fifteen to twenty-five kilometers. At intervals, the mountains project foothills to the east that reach the sea, forming a series of coastal basins, clearly defined, which gave rise to the different provinces of Annam.<br><br>
Tonkin and Cochinchina are alluvial lands, whose deltas are completely flat, and are cut by many rivers that form endless diversions and canals. The two regions are admirably fertile and produce huge amounts of rice, while Annam is less rich; that is why the Annamese have compared their country to a bamboo supporting at each end a rice basket; the comparison is quite correct to characterize compared the relationship of Cochinchina and Tonkin to Annam.<br><br>
<b>People of Indo-China.</b> The four regions are inhabited almost exclusively by the Annamese; conquering people, whose very ancient origins are lost in distant historical legends; we know, however, that the Annamese are from southern China and the province of Kwangtung, and they conquered Tonkin whose delta and arable lands they occupied by forcing the aboriginal populations into the mountains where they still live today under the name of Thos, Thais, Nungs, Mans, and which been designated under the generic name of Muong in Tonkin and Mois in Annam. Gradually, the tide of the Annamese invasion overflowed Tonkin to Annam, and went on spreading until Cochinchina.<br><br>
<b>Chinese Invasions.</b> But soon it was the turn of the Annamese to suffer the invasions of the Chinese, and, after various periods of success and setbacks, Annam was conquered and occupied entirely by the Chinese for centuries. It managed, however, around the fifteenth century to free itself from its conquerors, but remained a vassal state of the Emperor of China, to whom it promised to pay tribute every three years.<br><br>
<b>The Nguyen and Le dynasties.</b> After the wars against the foreigner came the civil wars that led, by the eighteenth century, to the split of Annam and Tonkin into two different kingdoms, the first under the Nguyen Dynasty, the second under the Le dynasty.<br><br>
<b>The Tay-Son Uprising.</b> Towards the end of the eighteenth century, a terrible event devastated the country. The Tay-Son, Chinese immigrants in Tonkin, rose en masse and, with the help of a large number of Chinese people from Kwangsi and Yun-Nan, conquered Tonkin and Annam: the king of this latter land, Nguyen-Anh, was forced to flee.<br><br>
<b>Treaty between France and Annam (Nov. 1787).</b> This is where the first intervention of France in Indo-China occurred. At this time, French Catholic missionaries had already penetrated into Annam and enjoyed great influence there; Monsignor Pigneau of Béhaine, Bishop of Adrán, persuaded the fugitive king to ask for the protection of the King of France, Louis XVI, in order to reconquer his kingdom, and to sign a treaty between France and Annam. The France would obtain the cession of the island of Pulo-Condor and the Turan peninsula, and would have to provide, in exchange, troops and money.<br><br>
The treaty was not executed, but Bishop Pigneau brought back from France several officers who came to offer their services to the king Nguyen-Anh. Thanks to them, he could begin to reconquer his kingdom. He first took Cochinchina in 1789, then conquered Annam in 1800 and Tonkin in 1802; he then took the title of Emperor and the name Gia Long.<br><br>
<b>The successors of Gia Long.</b> Under Gia Long, French influence was all-powerful, but it was not the same under his successors, Minh Bat-Mang, Thieu-Tri and Tu-Duc, who began to persecute the missionaries and Christians. Many times, the French ships had to come to punish the Annamese, but the massacres and insults nevertheless continued.<br><br>
<b>Taking Turan (31 August 1858).</b> Finally, in 1858, the French government decided to act, and Admiral Rigault de Genouilly bombed and took Turan on August 31; Spaniards had joined us for this expedition.<br><br>
<b>Taking Saigon (17 February 1859).</b> Soon, finding a bad situation in Turan, the Admiral left it and went on to Saigon, which he attacked and took on February 17, 1859.<br><br>
But at that moment, the war against China began. The expeditionary force in Annam, was reduced to 700 men, in order to reinforce the troops sent to China.<br><br>
Emboldened by the small number of our soldiers, the Annamese came to attack Saigon; but the brave little garrison, under the command of Captain Dariez, was able to keep the enemy at bay for two years and successfully resisted the attacks of nearly twenty thousand men (1859-1861).<br><br>
<b>Battle of Ki-Hoa (February 1861).</b> Finally, after the capture of Canton and Beijing, Admiral Charner came with reinforcements, liberated Saigon, and drove out the Annamese, thanks to the brilliant victories of Ki-Hoa and My-Tho.<br><br>
Transfer of Cochinchina. The Emperor Tu Duc sued for peace and gave us lower Cochinchina, with an indemnity of 20 million francs to France and Spain.<br><br>
In 1867, France conquered the rest of Cochinchina and imposed a protectorate on the king of Cambodge.<br><br>
