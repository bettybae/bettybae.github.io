			case 61: $("div#commentary").html('In this handwritten diary, Harrison Forman, photographer and explorer, documents the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 during the outbreak of World War II. In his account of the events that began the war, Forman describes the agreements by Britain and France committing them to assist Poland should they be invaded by the Germans. According to Forman, Poland set the tone for their own defeat with their reluctance to ask for help from Britain and France. Forman reported on Poland’s deficiencies in Warsaw and Lvov (Polish Lwów, western Ukraine) and the lack of communication in the field caused by spies cutting commercial telephone lines. Rather than holding ground at the Vistula River (Wisła in Polish), Forman believed the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish armed forces, Edward Rydz-Śmigly, made a tactical mistake by placing his army along the German border where Germany concentrated their attacks. Forman mentions Romania and other countries trying to remain neutral to avoid friction with Germany. He contrasts this to Italy’s involvement in the war claiming their only option was to side with Germany due to Italy and Britain’s contention over Ethiopia (Italo-Ethiopian War 1935-1936). Forman continues his thoughts on the tricky alliance between the Axis powers of Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union, telling of Italy’s fear of Russia and their suspicion of being double crossed by both countries. Italy became aware of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact (August 23, 1939), which cleared the way for the Nazis, led by Adolph Hitler, to invade Poland, only hours before it was signed, thereby dissolving the Anti-Comintern Pact (November 6, 1937) between Italy, German, and Japan against the Soviet Union. Forman mentions Francisco Franco, leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), and his disapproval of Hitler’s agreement with the Soviet Leader, Joseph Stalin. Despite Italy’s reluctance to enter the war, according to Forman, Benito Mussolini, Italian prime minister, committed Italy’s support to Hitler, via a message from his foreign secretary Count Galeazzo Ciano. Forman turns to his observations of civilian life in Warsaw, writing of men, women, and children digging trenches, keeping gas masks with them at all times, even when dancing at a cabaret for fear someone might pick theirs up during the chaos of an air raid. Forman notes that as the German forces broke through to the west, the Polish government fled to Romania, followed by civilians making their way to Lublin. Forman made notes about the Jewish population in Poland of three and a half million people, equivalent to 10% of the population, and by his account the “greatest proportion of all European countries.” Polish government radio reported on the capture of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) and portions of East Prussia, and the French advancing beyond the Rhine River and taking the Siegfried Line (a system of tank obstacles). As the battle heightened, Forman reports that Poland did not have the ability to mobilize quickly nor effectively. He called the fleeing of the government and people “The Big Scram of September 6.” Forman described the “Blitzkrieg in Poland” and the Germans sending in tanks with flame throwers that “mowed down the Calvary,” followed by planes that destroyed the Polish air force and infantry. Forman closes his diary noting that Poland “tried [to] sit on two chairs” forming pacts with France against Germany and with Germany against Russia.'); break;

Cavalry units were organised in 11 cavalry brigades, each composed of 3 to 4 cavalry regiments with organic artillery, armoured unit and infantry battalion. Two additional brigades had recently been converted to motorized and armoured units, but they retained their cavalry traditions. In addition, every infantry division had an organic cavalry detachment used for reconnaissance.<br><br>In contrast with its traditional role in armed conflicts of the past (even in the Polish-Bolshevik War), the cavalry was no longer seen as a unit capable of breaking through enemy lines. Instead, it was used as a mobile reserve of the Polish armies and was using mostly infantry tactics: the soldiers dismounted before the battle and fought as a standard (yet fast) infantry. Despite media reports of the time, particularly in respect of the Battle of Krojanty, no cavalry charges were made by the Polish Cavalry against German tanks.<br><br>Although the cavalrymen retained their Szabla wz. 1934 sabres, after 1937 the lance was dropped and it was issued to cavalrymen as a weapon of choice only. Instead, the cavalry units were equipped with modern armament, including 75 mm guns, tankettes, 37mm AT guns, 40mm AA guns, anti-tank rifles and other pieces of modern weaponry.<br><br>During the campaign, the brigades were distributed among the Polish armies and served as mobile reserves. In this role, the Polish cavalry proved itself a successful measure in filling the gaps in the front and covering the withdrawal of friendly units.
