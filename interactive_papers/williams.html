	<p>The British arrival in the Pacific in the second half of the eighteenth century was the result of both official and unofficial enterprise. Government was involved, but not consistently; science was represented, notably through the Royal Society; commercial interests became increasingly active; publishers brought out accounts of the voyages; and among individual explorers a naval officer, James Cook, stood supreme. The resources allocated to oceanic exploration were small; but in a region as remote from the main centers of European rivalry as the Pacific they were enough to establish a significant British presence by the end of the century.</p>
	
	<p>European vessels had ventured into the Pacific from the early sixteenth century; but their wanderings were for the most part inconclusive and confusing. The prodigious size of an ocean which covered a third of the globe's surface, imperfect methods of navigation, the ravages of scurvy, and the confines of wind and current presented daunting obstacles to the methodical accumulation of knowledge by Europeans of so distant a region. Knowledge there was, but it was unrecorded, at least in a form recognizable to outsiders. Long before Magellan's ships entered the Pacific in 1520 many of its 25,000 or so islands had been subject to a steady process of exploration, migration, and settlement.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a>  Slowly European seamen began to appreciate the achievement of Polynesian navigators, but it took the drawing for Cook in 1769 of a chart by Tupaia from the Society Islands before there was wider recognition of this. The chart showed seventy-four islands scattered across an area of ocean measuring 3,000 miles from east to west, and 1,000 miles from north to south. It was, one of Cook's scientists said, 'a monument of the ingenuity and geographical knowledge of the people in the Society Islands'.</p>
	
	<p>By the mid-seventeenth century Europe's process of Pacific exploration had almost halted. To the north Japan had been crudely charted by the Dutch, but the ocean to the north and east remained unexplored. The Pacific coast of Spanish America was known only as far as California, and what lay in the colossal space, 5,000 miles across, between there and the eastern fringes of Asia was a mystery. It might contain ocean or land, a bridge between continents, or the entrance of the North-west Passage. To the south, vessels following the diagonal course of the prevailing winds between Cape Horn and New Guinea, or sailing out of Spanish ports in Peru or Chile, had come across some island groups, but their exact position and extent were often conjectural. In particular, it was not certain whether they were the outliers of a great southern continent - Terra Australis Incognita - lying just over the horizon, and perhaps encompassing those stretches of the coasts of New Holland (Australia) and New Zealand revealed by Dutch expeditions.</p>
	
	<p>English seamen had played a minor role in these undertakings. English interest in the Pacific was mainly predatory. Since <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">Drake</a>'s circumnavigation of 1577-80, the Pacific had caught the English imagination not as a vast, trackless ocean but as the western rim of Spain's American empire. The 'South Sea', which by the late seventeenth century began to exercise its grip over distant enterprises was confined, in English eyes, to the waters which lapped the shores of Chile, Peru, and Mexico, the hunting grounds of the buccaneers. Exploration was not high among their priorities-'Gold was the bait that tempted a Pack of Merry Boys of us', one of them wrote<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[4]</a> -but their exploits proved of unending interest to the reading public at home. Prominent among them was <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">William Dampier</a>, an assiduous observer and writer who ventured to New Holland and other areas on the very periphery of Europe's knowledge. His <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25"><i>New Voyage Round the World</i></a> of 1697 was reprinted, anthologized, and translated, and in 1699 brought him command of a naval discovery expedition (in itself a rarity). Although this was the year when the long-impending crisis over the Spanish Succession and the future of Spain's overseas empire broke over Europe, there is no evidence that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">Dampier</a>'s voyage represented any serious thrust of national policy. The decision to explore the region around New Holland and New Guinea seems to have been <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">Dampier</a>'s rather than the government's, as he responded to an Admiralty request 'to make a proposal of some voyage wherein I might be serviceable to my Nation'<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[5]</a>. In the event, despite the discovery east of New Guinea of 'New Britain', the voyage was a troubled one, which ended in court-martial for <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">Dampier</a>, but as an Admiralty venture of oceanic exploration it was a precedent.</p>
	
	<p>The voyages of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">Dampier</a> and the privateers such as Woodes Rogers and George Shelvocke who came after him provided more in the way of popular reading- matter than of geographical and mercantile information. After the financial disaster of the 'South Sea Bubble' in 1720 the Pacific dropped out of the reckoning as a sphere of British enterprise for twenty years, though it retained its lure for compilers of the newly fashionable collections of 'Voyages and Travels', and for writers such as Defoe and Swift looking for a safe haven in which to pitch their satires. It was in the final chapter of Gulliver's Travels that Swift launched an attack on travel accounts and, more portentously, on the whole process of European overseas discovery. Later in the century such sentiments would be commonplace; in the England of the 1720s they were still novel.</p>
	
	<p>A crew of pirates are driven by a storm they know not whither, at length a boy discovers land from the topmast, they go on shore to rob and plunder; they see an harmless people, are entertained with kindness, they give the country a new name, they take formal possession of it for the King, they set up a rotten plank or a stone for a memorial, they murder two or three dozen of the natives, bring away a couple more by force for a sample, return home, and get their pardon. Here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by divine right.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[6]</a></p>
	
	<p>Not until the imminence of war with Spain in 1739 were new Pacific schemes officially considered again. The next year <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">Commodore George Anson</a>'s squadron of six ships sailed for Cape Horn and the South Sea on a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">voyage</a> which left few survivors, but which was saved from total disaster by the capture of the Acapulco treasure galleon off the Philippines. It took thirty-two wagons to carry the silver from Portsmouth to London after Anson's return, and newspaper accounts and individual narratives of the voyage quickly followed. Other publications considered the wider implications of Anson's expedition. The first volume of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">John Campbell</a>'s mammoth collection of voyages and travels advocated the establishment of two Pacific bases, one at Dampier's New Britain, the other on Juan Fernandez. Both were well placed, Campbell pointed out, for the exploration and exploitation of the great southern continent. 'It is impossible: argued Campbell, 'to conceive a Country that promises fairer from its Situation, than this of Terra Australis... whoever perfectly discovers & settles it will become infallibly possessed of Territories as Rich, as fruitful, & as capable of Improvement, as any that have been hitherto found out, either in the East Indies, or the West.'<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[7]</a></p>		
	
	<p>In 1748 the long-awaited official account of Anson's voyage appeared, and was in its fifth edition by the end of the year. It was more than a tale of treasure- seeking on the high seas, though this no doubt was the main reason for its popularity. At another level it was intended to encourage 'the more important purposes of navigation, commerce, and national interest', and with Anson now achieving a dominant position in naval affairs, the opinions expressed in the book were of weightier interest than usual. The Introduction stressed the value of accurate charts, global recordings of magnetic surveys, and proper surveys taken from naval vessels. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[8]</a> Despite such exhortations, and the fact that by 1751 Anson was First Lord of the Admiralty, the navy failed to establish any specialist surveying service, or even a hydrographic office on the French model to supervise the publication of charts.</p>		
	
	<p>Even so, the proposals for bases in the South Atlantic and South Pacific represented a new turn in British policy, and for a moment appeared to be bearing fruit. Early in 1749, the first year of peace, a naval expedition was prepared for the Falklands, Juan Fermindez, and beyond -only to be cancelled after strenuous Spanish protests. The concept of the Pacific as a Spanish lake died hard at Madrid, and the anxiety of the British government not to upset the negotiations in progress on the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36"><i>Asiento</i></a> led it to concede the point-'for the present', and without giving up the 'Right to send out Ships for the discovery of unknown and unsettled Parts of the World'. What <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">Benjamin Keene</a>, Britain's special envoy to the Spanish government, called 'their whimsical notions of exclusive rights in those seas' were to be respected, at least for the time being. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[9]</a></p>


	
	<p>The 'Right to send out Ships' to the Pacific was not to be exercised for another fifteen years, as the approach of global conflict with France turned the attention of the government elsewhere. On the conclusion of peace in 1763 official discovery expeditions were mounted in both Britain and France, with the secrecy of their instructions a sign of continuing rivalry. To some the Pacific, and especially the still-undiscovered southern continent, promised resources of such potential that its exploitation might tip the colonial balance of power. Geographers from the two countries continued to correspond, and British and French explorers would meet and part amicably enough; but beneath the exchanges of mutual compliments national rivalries ran deep and strong.</p>
	
	<p>In 1764 the first discovery expedition of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">George III</a>'s reign, commanded by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">John Byron</a>, sailed for the Pacific. It was less a precursor of the celebrated voyages to come than a throwback to earlier ventures. It was the abortive 1749 expedition writ large, and represented the bringing together of the plans of earlier generations. 'Trade and navigation' were to be the chief beneficiaries; Drake and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">Dampier</a> were the forerunners; the Falkland Islands and (more tenuously) the North-west Passage were the objectives; of science there was no mention.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[10]</a> Byron, on a record-breaking circumnavigation, followed the usual route across the Pacific west-north-west from the Strait of Magellan, and so made no discoveries of note. But while sailing through the northern fringes of the Tuamotu Archipelago in June 1765 he was convinced that there was a land mass not far to the south, probably the great continent,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[11]</a> and this was worked into the instructions of the expedition which followed Byron's, that of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">Captain Samuel Wallis</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">Captain Philip Carteret</a>. 'There is reason to believe [sic] that Lands, or Islands of great extent, hitherto unvisited by any European Power may be found in the Southern Hemisphere between Cape Horn and New Zealand, in Latitudes convenient for Navigation, and in Climates adapted to the product of Commodities useful in Commerce.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[12]</a></p>
	
	<p>Carteret proved an enterprising commander, and crossed the Pacific farther south than any other explorer had done, so lopping off a slice of the supposed southern continent. Wallis, by contrast, showed little initiative in his track across the Pacific, but his voyage was marked by a chance discovery, which had a double significance, for in June 1767 he sighted Tahiti. It was an encounter, which was to stamp an imprint both exotic and erotic upon Europe's image of the South Sea, and when a French expedition under <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">Bouganville</a> reached the island the following year reactions were even more effusive. Less publicized was the sighting by the master on Wallis's ship of the tops of mountains sixty miles south of Tahiti, which could only be part of the southern continent.'<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[13]</a> Just as Byron's illusory sense of a land mass to his south had influenced the direction of the Wallis and Carteret expedition, so this imagined sighting two years later was to play its part in the next Pacific voyage, for when Wallis arrived back in May 1768 he found another discovery expedition in preparation.</p>		

	<p>This, to begin with at least, was different from its predecessors, for its immediate objective was scientific. It was to answer the request of the Royal Society that the Admiralty should send a ship to the South Pacific to observe the Transit of Venus in 1769. As preparations continued, so the novelty of the venture became apparent. To the necessary astronomers were added other civilians--scientists and artists. It was they, particularly the young and well-connected botanist <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">Joseph Banks</a>, who attracted attention, rather than the unknown commander of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">Endeavour</a>, Lieutenant James Cook. The expedition seemed not to be part of the sequence of Pacific ventures, for it was not in genesis an Admiralty venture, and had little to do with affairs of state. The change came with the return of Wallis, with official news of the discovery of Tahiti and unofficial news of the possible sighting of the continent nearby. So the second part of Cook's instructions left considerations of science, and returned to the more familiar themes of trade and navigation. After completing astronomical observations at Tahiti Cook was to sail south, where 'there is reason to imagine that a Continent or Land of great extent, may be found'. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[14]</a></p>		

	<p>For enthusiasts such as <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">Alexander Dalrymple</a> the population of the southern continent might be 50 million or more, its size greater than that of Asia, and 'scraps' from its trade enough 'to maintain the power, dominion, and sovereignty of BRITAIN by employing all its manufactures and Ships'. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[15]</a> This was an alluring if distant prospect, but to insist that ‘upon that area [the South Pacific] the main drive of national policy was concentrated’ <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[16]</a> is to overstate the case, and the influence of the geographical theorists of the age. Although the Admiralty now saw seaborne exploration as one of its responsibilities, there was no official master - plan of Pacific discovery into which the voyages of Cook and his colleagues neatly fit. More realistically, it can be argued that the modest resources of ships and men committed to Pacific exploration represented a promising but limited investment. If a great southern continent existed, or a navigable North-west Passage, then Britain should make the discovery since it would redound 'to the honor of this Nation as a Maritime Power, to the Dignity of the Crown of Great Britain, and to the advancement of the Trade and Navigation thereof'. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[17]</a> If not, then there would be other, perhaps lesser, returns: the training of seamen; the advancement of science; the matching of the nation's recent wartime feats with the accomplishments of peace.</p>		

	<p>Shortly before the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">Endeavour</a> sailed, the President of the Royal Society, Lord Morton, appealed to Cook and Banks for the utmost patience and forbearance with respect to the Natives of the several Lands where the Ship may touch... To have it still in view that shedding [sic] the blood of those people is a crime of the highest nature: They are human creatures, the work of the same omnipotent Author, equally under his care with the most polished European; perhaps being less offensive, more entitled to his favor. They are the natural, and in the strictest sense of the word, the legal possessors of the several Regions they inhabit. No European Nation has a right to occupy any part of their country, or settle among them without their voluntary consent.'</p>

	
	<p>Cook's instructions had already advised him that he should obtain 'the Consent of the Natives' before taking possession, but they also reminded him that Wallis had found them 'to be rather treacherous than otherwise'. In general terms Cook was 'to observe the Genius, Temper, Disposition and Number of the Natives'. This latter was easier said than done. Not only was there no fundamental similarity of language and custom among the peoples of the three great divisions of the Pacific-Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia-but in the period before the development of the disciplines of ethnology and anthropology there was no accepted method of classification of human societies. Europeans were entering a region where, after successive migrations, and a seeping of culture influences from one island group to another, societies were organized in a series of overlapping layers-quite baffling to untrained observers. Comprehension was made more difficult by the strained nature of the contact. The Pacific navigators of the period were for the most part moderate and humane, certainly by earlier standards. Even so, the Europeans were intruders, emerging by the score from their great vessel anchored in some island bay, 'men from the sky', appearing and disappearing without warning, often violating sacred sites. An inescapable tension hung over the encounters, sometimes dissipated by individual contacts or trade, but at other times erupting into violence. Though the relationship between Polynesians and Europeans was not the one-sided affair of some portrayals, in the longer term the introduction of venereal disease, alcohol, and firearms brought a depressing train of consequences to the islands-sickness, demoralization, and depopulation.</p>
	
	<p>Cook's first voyage was a sign of things to come. With only one ship, he charted more than 5,000 miles of previously unknown coastline. The twin islands of New Zealand, the east coast of Australia, and Torres Strait at last emerged from the mists of uncertainty. As he reached land uncharted and unvisited by Europeans, so Cook followed his instructions and took possession. That part of his instructions advising him to do this with the consent of the natives was less diligently observed.</p>
	
	<p>In January 1770 he claimed possession of Queen Charlotte Sound in New Zealand after a rather inadequate explanation to a small group of Maoris that the posts and flags were being erected 'to shew to any ship that might put into this place that we had been here before'. In August at Cape York Cook annexed the whole of the east coast of Australia from lat. 38°S. on the grounds, as later explained, that it was terra nullius, 'no person's land'. As far as the southern continent was concerned, Cook reached lat. 40°S. without sighting land, and noted that the long ocean swell rolling up from the south-east argued against the existence of any land mass in that direction.</p>
	
	<p>On Cook's return the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Earl of Sandwich, took steps to encourage early publication of the journals of the voyage. Banks had argued for this in order to pre-empt French claims, while Cook was emphatic that his and earlier journals should be 'published by Authority to fix the prior right of discovery behond [sic] dispute.’ The task was entrusted to Dr John Hawkesworth, who fused the individual journals of Cook and Banks into a single narrative to make the Endeavour expedition the resounding climax to his three-volume Voyages of 1773, which also included the accounts of Byron, Wallis, and Carteret. The hue-and-cry which followed Hawkesworth's editorial methods has obscured the essential point that all the major discovery journals of the reign had been published with official approval and backing. A precedent had been set which would be difficult to reverse.</p>
	
	<p>Cook's second voyage was the logical complement to what had been explored, and left unexplored, on his first. It took place in a context of some diplomatic sensitivity, for both France and Spain had ships out; and there is some evidence that only Sandwich's 'perseverance' prevented cancellation of the expedition. Again there were naturalists (not Banks this time, but Johann Reinhold Forster and his son George), astronomers, and an artist. The novelties of 1768 were becoming standard practice. And, arguably as important as any of the human supernumeraries, there were on board for the first time chronometers, one of which was Larcum Kendall's copy of John Harrison's masterpiece, his fourth marine timekeeper. This superb instrument kept accurate time through the buffeting of the long voyage, to show that the problem of determining longitude at sea had at last been overcome. In his three years away Cook disposed of the imagined southern continent, reached closer to the South Pole than any man before him, and touched on a multitude of lands-New Zealand and Tahiti again, and for the first time Easter Island, the Marquesas, Tonga, and the New Hebrides. Almost all had been sighted by earlier expeditions; even in the conventional definition Cook did not 'discover' them for Europe. His contribution was to bring a sense of order to the confusion of the earlier maps and reports, to replace vagueness and uncertainty with a new, pin-point accuracy. There was, he judged, little more to do in the South Pacific: 'The Southern Hemisphere sufficiently explored and a final end put to the searching after a Southern Continent, which has at times in grossed the attention of some of the Maritime Powers for near two Centuries past and the Geographers of all ages.' On his two voyages he had established the framework of the modem map of the South Pacific: Polynesia and southern Melanesia; New Zealand and New South Wales; Torres Strait and the southern extremities of the great ocean. All this was set out in Cook's splendid account, published in 1777, with some help from Dr John Douglas, A Voyage Towards the South Pole, and Round the World.</p>
	
	<p>Cook was never to see his book, for in 1776 he left again for the Pacific on his third and final voyage. This time he was headed for the northern expanses of the ocean in an effort to solve that other long-standing geographical mystery-the existence of a North-west Passage. Once again, the Royal Society was prominent in applying pressure on the Admiralty for the voyage, but Spanish suspicions that there was more to the British swing north than scientific curiosity may have been justified. The year in which war with the American colonies broke out would not appear to be a time when the Admiralty could easily spare for a scientific mission even the three smallish ships it intended to send to the Pacific and (as a support operation) to Baffin Bay. The attempts by the British government to establish a base in the Falklands from 1766 had shown its interest in securing an entrance into the Pacific. It may have been more than a coincidence that the decision to send a naval expedition to look for the North-west Passage was made in the same year (1774) as the enforced abandonment of Port Egmont in the Falklands, one of the conditions for ending the Anglo-Spanish crisis over the islands of 1770-71. The discovery of a northern route to the Pacific might compensate for the loss of control over the longer southern one, and if one were not found then there still might be attractive commercial possibilities in Japan and neighboring lands.</p>
	
	<p>In the end Cook found no North-west Passage as he spent the summer of 1778 in hazardous exploration along the broken coastline of North-west America, from Nootka Sound to Bering Strait. In a single season he put the main outline of that coast on the charts, determined the shape of the Alaskan peninsula, and closed the gap between the Spanish coastal probes from the south and those of the Russians from Kamchatka. It was to be his last achievement, for in February 1779 he was killed at Hawaii, the northernmost outlier of Polynesia, unexpectedly encountered by the expedition only the year before. Cook's death at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779 remains a source of fascination and controversy. During the pre- ceding weeks Cook seems to have been regarded by the islanders as the god Lono, bringer of light, peace, and plenty: his escort of priests, the abasement before him of the people, and the protection of the expedition's equipment and stores by the imposition of a tabu all indicate this. Some scholars have stressed the series of coincidences, which marked the arrival of Cook's ships off Hawaii. It was the time of makahiki, the festival of Lono; and the ships with their masts and sails mirrored Lono's Their slow circuit around Hawaii resembled the annual procession on land in honour of Lono, and their destination was Kealalekua Bay, the site of Lono's temple. Cook continued to conform to sacred tradition by leaving Hawaii as makahiki came to an end: the new season was devoted, more ominously, to Ku, the god of war. But when damage to the Resolution forced Cook back to the bay a few days later he was out of season, a violator of sacred customs. In the eerie atmosphere of uneasiness, which followed, Cook's death at the hands of the islanders was predictable, if not pre-ordained. Not all accept this interpretation. Some scholars insist that Cook's 'deification' is the invention of western, imperialist tradition, and that the initial enthusiasm which greeted him simply represented an attempt to enlist the support of this powerful outsider in inter- island warfare. They explain Cook's death by what they see as his irrational behavior and uncontrollable outbursts of temper.</p>
	
	<p>News of the killing of Europe's greatest navigator at Kealakekua Bay over-shadowed all other reports from the expedition when it reached England. It brought into sharper focus a conflict of attitudes about the peoples of the Pacific, which had developed both among the discovery crews and among the scholars of Europe. To those who had seen the islands, Tahiti and its neighbors seemed at first earthly paradises, but closer acquaintance showed that there was shade as well as light-there was war, infanticide, distinctions of rank and property. The death of Cook, following as it did the massacre of one of his boat crews in New Zealand in 1773, and the killing of the French navigator Marion du Fresne and two dozen of his men not far away a year earlier together with suspicions of cannibalism among the Maori, were signs to some of an innately treacherous and murderous disposition. Others saw in the islands traces of a golden age, and feared that it was European influences, which were corrupting and contaminating. More dispassion- ate observers were influenced by the fashionable insistence in European philosophical circles on measuring human societies by their capacity and desire for improvement; and they found few Pacific peoples who conformed to western ideals of progress and development.</p>
	
	<p>It was Cook's third voyage, with John Webber as the expedition's artist, which produced the fullest account and illustrations of the Pacific peoples. Scholars who see the lavish official accounts of Cook's voyages as part of a humanizing myth which concealed their rough reality can point to the way in which Webber's set- piece paintings and drawings mostly depicted friendly encounters. Receptions entertainments, ceremonies, loom large rather than the clashes, which became a depressingly familiar feature of the voyage. This selectivity raises large questions about the value-laden nature of visual representation, and the extent to which the recording of native peoples was a form of cultural appropriation; but to see Cook's artists merely as facilitators of imperialist dominance would be crude and misleading. One of the constraints imposed on ethnographic drawing was that its subjects could not, like some natural history specimen, be pinned to a board. Their co-operation and trust had to be obtained, and the nature of the cultural contact between them and the artist was different from the more fleeting trading or sexual encounters with his shipmates. Yet if the artist represented the soft edge of the contact process, behind him stood the threat of force, of marines, muskets, and great guns. So Webber's celebrated painting of Poedua, daughter of the chief of Raiatea, was probably done during the tense five days that father and daughter were held hostage by Cook.</p>
	
	<p>Although Cook set new standards in the extent and accuracy of his surveys, to see his voyages simply in terms of the accumulation of hydrographical and geographical knowledge would be to miss their broader significance. There was a new methodology, European rather than exclusively English in scope, but shown most clearly in Cook's voyages. His three successive expeditions helped to lift him above other explorers in both official and popular esteem. Bougainville cut a striking figure among the ranks of Cook's contemporaries, but he never returned to the Pacific after his voyage of 1766-69. His immediate successors, Surville and Marion du Fresne, were lesser figures; while the great French expedition of the late 1780s that of La Perouse, vanished without trace. There was a dominance, though by no means a monopoly, of British accounts and charts of the Pacific; and this had come about partly by policy, partly by chance. At the Admiralty Sandwich set the precedent of encouraging prompt and full publication of the discovery journals, whereas other European governments were less committed. In the 1790S Vancouver's record of his voyage to the north-west coast of America was published; the contemporary Spanish surveys of the same region were not. The Spanish expedition of Malaspina (1791-95) was probably the best equipped of all the eighteenth-century survey ventures, but its findings disappeared into the archives when Malaspina fell from grace after his return to Spain.</p>
	
	<p>So, much was left to Cook, though in many ways he was representative rather than unique in his insistent determination to show things as they were, to dispel myth and illusion by way of empirical observation and prompt publication. The observations made by Cook and his associates played an important role in astronomy, oceanography, meteorology, linguistics, and much else. In the realm of natural history the voyages were among the great collecting expeditions of any era. The amount of material brought back simply could not be assimilated by the older encyclopedic sciences. Nowhere was this more evident than in the study of the peoples of the Pacific. It was the voyages of Cook and his contemporaries which helped to give birth in the next century to the new disciplines of ethnology and anthropology; for the earnest inquiry by the explorers into the exotic life- styles which confronted them, and their painstaking if uninformed collection of data, brought a new urgency to the need for a more systematic study of humankind.</p>
	
	<p>In more practical ways, too, Cook set new standards. His achievements would not have been possible without healthy crews, and his record here was impressive, especially in the second voyage. There were no recorded deaths from scurvy on any of his voyages, and (except for a disastrous stay at Batavia in 1770, which helped to produce a final mortality rate of 43 per cent on the Endeavour) few from natural causes generally. Much research had gone into the causes of scurvy since Anson lost three-quarters of his men on his circumnavigation of 1740-44, notably by James Lind at the Haslar Naval Hospital. He had discovered, or rather rediscovered, the antiscorbutic properties of lemon juice. Paradoxically, Cook's success in keeping his crews alive delayed the acceptance of this remedy for scurvy, for although he used lemon juice he attributed no particular importance to it. What was unusual about Cook was the thoroughness with which he applied a whole range of antiscorbutic measures. Uncertain of the causes of scurvy, Cook combined all suggested remedies. It was, one medical historian has commented, 'a blunderbuss approach to antiscorbutic treatment'.</p>
	
	<p>Even so, as the contributor to a medical journal of the time noted, Cook had 'proved to the world the possibility of carrying a ship's crew through a variety of climates, for the space of near four years, without losing one man by disease; a circumstance which added more to his fame, and is supposed to have given a more useful lesson to maritime nations, than all the discoveries he ever made.' This was but one aspect of the way in which Cook, in Bernard Smith's words, became 'a new kind of hero for a new time'. It is illustrated in Philip Loutherbourg's design for The Apotheosis of Captain Cook, published as an engraving in 1794, in which Cook is shown ascending into the clouds after his bloody death at Kealakekua Bay holding in his hand, not a sword, but a sextant. It was an image of the hero particularly appealing to the next century when, to follow Smith's argument further, Cook's achievements were well suited 'to the ideological belief-however distant from the true state of affairs-in a world-wide empire dedicated to the arts of peace (a Pax Britannica), not one based upon war'.</p>
	
	<p>If on his three voyages Cook had established the main features of the Pacific, much remained to be done, though rather in the way of detailed surveying than in solving fundamental geographical problems. Dr Douglas, editor of the journals of Cook's third voyage, pointed the way forward to the next stage of Pacific enterprise when he wrote in his Introduction that 'every nation that sends a ship to sea will partake of the benefit [of the published accounts; but Great Britain herself, whose commerce is boundless, must take the lead in reaping the full advantage of her own discoveries'. By the end of the century there were British settlements in New South Wales; Nootka had taken on a new significance-no longer Cook's watering place on the north-west coast of America but a centre of international dispute; the first missionaries had reached Tahiti, Tonga, and the Marquesas; and everywhere the traders and whalers were beginning to follow the explorers' tracks. With the change from exploration to exploitation came a change of government agency. The Admiralty gave way to departments more closely concerned with trade and colonies. In the 1780s the ministry most involved was the Home Office, whose functions rather incongruously included oversight of Britain's overseas possessions. There was also a change of personalities, for Sandwich resigned in 1782 as the American war dragged to its close, and none of his immediate successors showed his commitment to exploration. If there was a single guiding light in the new surge of oceanic endeavor, which followed Cook's voyages, it was Joseph Banks. The young naturalist of Cook's first voyage was now one of the most influential men in England: baronet, President of the Royal Society, adviser of Cabinet ministers, patron of the sciences on an international scale. He was an assiduous promoter of enterprises associated with Cook's explorations, and although the new Pacific voyages were more practical and commercial than scientific, Banks seemed to be involved at every turn. It was Banks who, in 1787, was responsible for the dispatch of William Bligh to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants for Britain's West Indian colonies. There, it was hoped, their cultivation would provide cheap food for the slave population. The first attempt at this scheme, characteristic of the global dimension of Banks's projects, was frustrated by the high drama of the mutiny on the Bounty.</p>
	
	<p>The South Pacific after Cook was reached simultaneously by settlers and whalers. Cook's favorable report of 1770 on New South Wales (as transmitted by Hawkesworth) was enhanced by Banks's recollection in 1785 that the land at the Endeavoufs first landing spot at Botany Bay was 'sufficiently fertile to support a considerable number of Europeans', and that the 'very few' Aborigines there would no doubt 'speedily abandon the Country to the New Comers'. As Evan Nepean, the official most concerned with the settlement, wrote, New South Wales 'appears to be a Country peculiarly adapted for a Settlement, the Lands about it being plentifully supplied with Wood and Water, the Soil rich and fertile, and the Shores well stocked with Shell and other Fish'. This may have been enough to prompt the government to choose Botany Bay as the new site for convicts who previously would have been transported to the American colonies. Less-publicized reasons may also have played a part: the possibility of developing Botany Bay as a base strategically situated on the south or 'blind' side of the Dutch East Indies; the hope of producing naval stores in the form of timber and flax; the necessity of a preventive strike to stifle French moves towards the region. The First Fleet itself, two warships, six transports, three store ships, represented in terms of organization and successful accomplishment of its mission eighteenth-century government at its best, rather than (as some historians have maintained) at its worst. The same cannot said of its immediate successors. Despite the poor health of some of the convicts on embarkation, out of 756 adult convicts who sailed from Spithead in the spring of 1787 only thirty-three died on the voyage of more than eight months.</p>
	
	<p>Whalers were among the transports of the First Fleet, which arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788, and of subsequent convict fleets. Once released from their transportation duties, they turned to the quest for the great sperm whales of the southern seas, whose oil was more highly valued than that of the 'right' whales of the traditional Greenland fishery. In 1786 an Act for 'The Encouragement of the Southern Whale Fishery' had been passed which marked the beginning of the British fishery in the southern oceans, and of a running tussle with the monopoly rights of the East India Company, whose Directors were fearful that 'the Pacific was the back door to the Indian Ocean and the China Seas and Cook had undone the lock'. Gradually the Company's efforts to limit the whalers' legal areas of operation in the South Seas were beaten down by a combination of government and mercantile pressure, and whalers entered the great ocean both round the Horn and by way of the Cape of Good Hope. By 1790 there were fifty British whalers fitted out for the southern oceans, and within three years this number had almost doubled. A new lure was the fur seal, whose pelt was easily saleable at Canton, and whose southern locations--from South Georgia in the South Atlantic to Dusky Sound in New Zealand-had been identified by Cook on his second voyage.</p>
	
	<p>For the convicts, who, with their guards, were landed at Botany Bay in January 1788, the first years under the command of Governor Arthur Phillip were ones of hardship, sometimes of despair. Nothing was as anticipated. Botany Bay in the heat of midsummer bore little resemblance to the descriptions of May 1770, after the autumn rains had filled the creeks and brought a lush covering of grass. Add also that the bay was shoal water, dangerously exposed to the east, and one can understand why Phillip decided to look for another site. At Port Jackson he found the incomparable harbor where 'a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security', and moved the settlement to Sydney Cove. If it was a safer anchorage for ships, the mixed community of convicts and their guards seemed little better off. 'Their situation', Phillip wrote after six months, was 'so very different from what might be expected.' There were huge problems in clearing the ironbarks and redbarks, scurvy had taken a grip, 'the natives are far more numerous than they were supposed to be', and regular food supplies from Britain would be needed for some time to come.</p>
	
	<p>Only with the move inland to the fertile soil of Parramatta and then towards the Hawkesbury river did matters improve, but before that New South Wales had to endure its equivalent of the 'starving time' of earlier North American colonizing ventures. The death of most of the livestock, crop failures, the non-appearance of the promised second expedition in 1789, reduced the settlement to a desperate state. If the worst was over after the arrival of the Second Fleet in mid-1790, there were still hardships and worries to come, but by the time of Phillip's departure at the end of 1792 the future of the young colony seemed assured. There were 2,500 colonists, and settlement had spread on to the Cumberland Plain; 1,200 government acres under crops (and some private farms); sheep, cattle, pigs, and horses. In 1792 officers of the garrison (the New South Wales Corps) were allowed to receive land- grants, and from 1795 free settlers began to arrive in a small trickle. Port Jackson became a calling-place for whalers and sealers, and in other ways too the maritime activities of the little colony were in the early years more striking than its slow expansion on land. Although the barrier of the Blue Mountains hampered interior exploration, seaborne surveys were mounted both from the colony and from Europe. By the early years of the nineteenth century the discovery by George Bass and Matthew Flinders of Bass Strait, and the wider-ranging surveys by Flinders in the Investigator and by the French expedition under Nicolas Baudin, had completed the coastal outline of most of the continent. Flinders, in his letters and published Voyage of 1814, referred to the continent as 'Australia', and in 1817 Governor Macquarie adopted the title in the hope that it would become 'the Name given to this Country in future'.</p>
	
	<p>Among the problems Phillip left behind was that of relations with the Aborigines. Precisely what was to be the status of the Aborigines in and around the new settlement had never been clear. The instructions given to Phillip were well- meaning but imprecise: 'to open an intercourse with the natives, and to conciliate their affections, enjoining all our subjects to live in amity and kindness with them.' The first contacts seemed peaceable enough, but soon the Aborigines were showing signs of fear and hostility as Phillip's orders to treat them well were ignored by ships' crews and convicts alike. Soon a pattern had emerged of mutual suspicion and occasional violence, intensified when a mysterious outbreak of smallpox in 1789 carried off about half the Aborginal population of the Sydney area. Although by the end of 1790 a certain degree of trust had been restored, one of Phillip's officials pointed out that 'While they [the Aborigines] entertained the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always con- sider us their enemies'. But the matter went further than' a clash of material interests, for two incompatible cultures had been thrust against each other. The Aboriginal life-style was based on family groups bonded to the land in so intimate a fashion that their knowledge of its plants, animals, and water allowed them to exist in an environment where strangers would have perished without outside supplies. For all the vaunted superiority of the Europeans, the First Fleet settlers were brought near starvation and death when the follow-up expedition failed to arrive. Aboriginal implements, material possessions, dwellings, were minimal. No greater contrast could exist with the incessant digging, enclosing, and building activities of the newcomers, determined to conquer their environment, and using military discipline and individual ownership as means to that end. The difficulties of understanding experienced by Europeans in their confrontation with the peoples of the Pacific in the eighteenth century reached their most acute form in the encounter with the Aborigines. The ethnocentric attempt of the explorers to find evidence in the Pacific islands of familiar customs and structures ran into a dead end of incomprehension at Sydney Cove.</p>
	
	<p>As the settlement was undergoing its hardest months in early 1790 it was very much in the thoughts of the home government, though in a rather unexpected way. A naval expedition was being prepared which was to call at Port Jackson, and there take on board convicts and members of the New South Wales Corps to help in the establishment of a fur-trading base on the north-west coast of America. This enterprising example of pan-Pacific thinking by the government came as an unexpected crisis with Spain developed over events at Nootka Sound the previous year. It is another reminder of how far-flung was the influence of Cook's voyages, and how much Banks saw himself as the promoter of enterprises connected with those voyages. British ships (from India in the first place) had been among the first to reach the north-west coast after Cook's report of the wealth of sea-otter furs there. In London, Banks was involved in several of these expeditions as he helped to shape their instructions and kept in touch with their progress. Although primarily trading ventures, these vessels, often captained by men who had sailed with Cook, also carried out explorations which revived hopes that a navigable strait might be found along the coast. Such a strait, argued Alexander Dalrymple, at this time hydrographer to the East India Company, would make possible a new northern network of trade encompassing North America, China, and Japan.48 The will-'o-the-wisp of the Japan trade and the potential of the China market also attracted Banks, and like Dalrymple he saw furs from the north-west coast as answering the perennial problem of the East India Company of finding commodities acceptable at Canton to fuel the expanding tea trade.</p>
	
	<p>By the late 1780s there was a great stir of projects centering on the North Pacific. Government was at first not directly involved. The East India Company held trading rights east of the Cape of Good Hope, and it licensed the legal British trading expeditions of these years to the north-west coast. The explorers, maritime and overland, were servants of private companies: the rival fur-trading organizations of the Canadian-based Northwest Company and the London-based Hudson's Bay Company, and the new King George's Sound [Nootka Sound] Company of John Cadman Etches. In Britain, Banks and Dalrymple acted as clearing-houses for the reports of the traders and explorers, and by 1789 were involved in projects for the establishment of a trading base on the north-west coast. This, it was pointed out in familiar language, could also be used to attack Spanish settlements and ships in time of war.</p>
	
	<p>All such plans and projects came to an abrupt halt when, in February 1790, news reached London that a Spanish force (sent north from San Bias to intercept reported Russian vessels) had seized four British trading ships and a shore establishment at Nootka Sound the previous summer. Even before it knew details of what exactly had happened, the response of the Pitt government was clear-and hard. It demanded from Spain the restitution of property, an apology, and in general terms the recognition of the principle of effective occupation. As comparative late-comers to the region, the British set this against the twin Spanish arguments of papal bulls and treaty agreements dating from the late fifteenth century, and prior discovery. The right to trade and establish posts in any area not actually occupied by Europeans was a cardinal feature of British policy in the late eighteenth century, and was used against the Dutch as well as the Spanish. Nootka was a test case, and both British and Spanish governments appeared to be ready to go to war over what, on the face of it, was an insignificant and remote skirmish.</p><p>But much was at stake: the fur trade of the north-west coast, and the wider question of territorial rights on that coast and beyond. In April 1789, only a few months before the Nootka incident, two British whalers had been chased off the Patagonian coast by Spanish frigates despite their pleas that it was a 'desert' and unoccupied region where they could water and carry out repairs. As Henry Dundas reminded the House of Commons in one of the Nootka debates, 'We are not contending for a few miles, but a large world'.</p>
	
	<p>In the flurry of fleet mobilization the projected naval expedition to the north- west coast, calling at New South Wales en route, was dropped, or at least post-poned. The Spanish rearguard action in defense of its traditional rights collapsed, for a France in the grip of revolutionary turmoil was in no position to offer help, and in October 1790 the Nootka Sound Convention was signed. It provided for the restitution of land and buildings seized at Nootka in 1789, for reparations, and for free access and trade to all areas of the coast not occupied by Spain. This would help the fur traders in the north and the whalers in the south. As the government claimed in 1791, 'all British ships...shall have liberty to go round Cape Horn and through the Streights of Magellan to any part of the Western Coast of the Continent of America not occupied by Spain ... or to any part of the Pacific Ocean, for the purpose of Trade and Fishery'. If Spanish weakness allowed Britain in 1790 to refute sovereignty based on prior discovery, in the long term it was an even newer arrival in the Pacific, the United States, which was to benefit most. Pitt 'opened the way for other challengers...with even less respect for hoary papal bulls, archaic rites, wooden crosses, and interred bottles testifying to possession'.</p>
	
	<p>With the convention signed, the Pitt government reinstated the expedition to the northwest coast. It was to be commanded by George Vancouver, who had been with Cook on his second and third voyages. He was set two tasks by his instructions of March 1791: to receive restitution of the land at Nootka seized in 1789, and to explore the coast north to latitude 60°N in search of a waterway through the continent suitable for ocean-going vessels. A year later a matching expedition was being prepared to survey the Pacific coasts of South America with a view to finding a suitable base for the whalers; and this was eventually carried out in 1793-94 by James Colnett in the Rattler. On the north-west coast, Vancouver was more at ease with the surveying than the diplomatic part of his mission. His protracted negotiations with the Spanish at Nootka about the details of the restitution provoked an impatient comment from his superiors in London: 'All that we really are anxious about...is the Safety of our National honor which renders a Restitution necessary. The Extent of that Restitution is not of much moment.' The logical outcome of this attitude was the (Third) Nootka Convention January 1794, which agreed to a mutual abandonment of Nootka by both Spaniards and British. It was signed as Vancouver was approaching his third season on the coast. His painstaking survey of the tortuous mainland shoreline, much of it repeating work done by Spanish expeditions, was completed in August 1794. He saw his mission, not as an attempt to find the North-west Passage, but as one to prove that it did not exist, at least not in temperate latitudes. In doing so, he saw himself as rescuing Cook's reputation from those theorists such as Dalrymple who had besmirched the great explorer's work on the north-west coast. Vancouver's attitude was characteristic of the practical seamen of his age. From Bougainville to La Perouse, from Cook to Bligh, they expressed their disdain for the 'theoretical navigators: 'the hypothetical projectors'. In reality, the relationship between explorers and geographers was a complementary one, and the role of the latter in coordinating information and stimulating interest in distant regions should not be under-estimated.</p>
	
	<p>As was now almost routine, the Admiralty made it clear to Vancouver on his return that it wished the events of the voyage to be made available 'for Publick information', and it paid for the cost of engraving the charts and views in his published account. Significantly, some of these were 'in Mr. Dalrymple's Office'; for in 1795 a Hydrographic Office of the Admiralty had at last been established, with Alexander Dalrymple as the first Hydrographer. After 1815 the Office, increasingly, took over the direction of naval survey expeditions; and a new professionalism replaced the older tradition of individual, and sometimes uncoordinated efforts.</p>
	
	<p>The role of Banks in the surge of British enterprise in the North Pacific after Cook's final voyage varied from encouragement of individuals to direct intervention with the government, from the collecting and distributing of information to the supervision of the scientific side of the voyages. It is a role which is sometimes difficult to assess in precise terms, for much of what Banks accomplished went unrecorded in either state or private papers. For him there was no contradiction between the promotion of the wider objectives of scientific investigation and the forthright pursuit of the material objectives of his own country. In 1788 he had put the matter bluntly to a Frenchman:' I certainly wish that my Country men should make discoveries of all kinds in preference to the inhabitants of other Kingdoms. In one sense, Banks's role as a coordinator of projects of overseas exploration and trade was evidence that, for government, much of this activity was still peripheral. It is perhaps significant that Vancouver's negotiation of what he understood to be the 'cession' of Hawaii to Britain in 1794was ignored in London, and so faded from sight. Away from the flash-point of Nootka or the much-discussed convict settlement at Botany Bay, most of the new enterprises in the Pacific took place beyond official view or interest.</p>
	
	<p>George Vancouver had seen his Pacific surveys as part of 'that expansive arch, over which the arts and sciences should pass to the furthermost corners of the earth, for the instruction and happiness of the most lowly children of nature... the untutored parts of the human But the responsibility for this task would not be the government's. It was left to the missionaries to undertake the formidable double task of conversion and protection. In the 1790s the whalers and sealers were using the recently charted Pacific islands for victualing, watering, and refitting; and they paid with firearms and liquor-a lethal combination for many islanders. By the end of the decade the sea-hunters had been joined by traders from Sydney, Europe, and the United States searching for sandalwood, and for dried sea-slugs and birds' nests for the gourmets of China. The missionaries were only slightly slower in arriving-an attempt to send four with Bligh on his second breadfruit voyage to Tahiti in 1791 failed-but the first sermon delivered by Thomas Haweis to the London Missionary Society after its founding in 1795 stressed the opportunities awaiting dedicated workers in the Pacific. 'A new world hath lately opened to our view, call it Island or Continent, that exceeds Europe in size: New Holland; and now become the receptacles of our outcasts of society-New Zealand, and the innumerable islands, which spot the bosom of the Pacific Ocean: The next year the missionary ship Duff left for Tahiti, Tongatapu, and the Marquesas, carrying no fewer than twenty-nine missionaries (and five wives). Within a year of landing on Tahiti the missionaries were involved in local politics, were denouncing infanticide, and had their first confrontation with a trading brig attempting to exchange firearms for local produce. The pattern had been set for much that was to take place in the islands in the nineteenth century. As the younger Forster had said, though with different and more scholarly considerations in mind: 'What Cook has added to the mass of our knowledge is such that it will strike deep roots and will long have the most decisive influence on the activity of men.’</p>
