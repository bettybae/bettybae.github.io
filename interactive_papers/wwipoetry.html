<b>Channel Firing</b><br>
<br>
That night your great guns, unawares,<br>
Shook all our coffins as we lay,<br>
And broke the chancel window-squares,<br>
We thought it was the Judgment-day<br>
<br>
And sat upright. While drearisome<br>
Arose the howl of wakened hounds:<br>
The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,<br>
The worms drew back into the mounds,<br>
<br>
The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, ‘No;<br>
It’s gunnery practice out at sea<br>
Just as before you went below;<br>
The world is as it used to be:<br>
<br>
‘All nations striving strong to make<br>
Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters<br>
They do no more for Christés sake<br>
Than you who are helpless in such matters.<br>
<br>
‘That this is not the judgment-hour<br>
For some of them’s a blessed thing,<br>
For if it were they'd have to scour<br>
Hell's floor for so much threatening . . .<br>
<br>
‘Ha, ha .. It will be warmer when<br>
I blow the trumpet (if indeed<br>
I ever do; for you are men,<br>
And rest eternal sorely need).’<br>
<br>
So down we lay again. ‘I wonder,<br>
Will the world ever saner be,’<br>
Said one, ‘than when He sent us under<br>
In our indifferent century!’<br>
<br>
And many a skeleton shook his head.<br>
‘Instead of preaching forty year,’<br>
My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,<br>
I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.’<br>
<br>
Again the guns disturbed the hour,<br>
Roaring their readiness to avenge,<br>
As far inland as Stourton Tower,<br>
And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.<br>

<b>In Flanders Fields</b><br>
<br>
In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>
Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.<br>
<br>
We are the Dead. Short days ago<br>
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br>
Loved and were loved, and now we lie<br>
In Flanders fields.<br>
<br>
Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br>
To you from failing hands we throw<br>
The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br>
If ye break faith with us who die<br>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br>
In Flanders fields.<br>

<b>‘When you see millions of the mouthless dead’</b><br>
<br>
When you see millions of the mouthless dead<br>
Across your dreams in pale battalions go,<br>
Say not soft things as other men have said,<br>
That you'll remember. For you need not so.<br>
Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know<br>
It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?<br>
Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.<br>
Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.<br>
Say only this, 'They are dead.' Then add thereto,<br>
'Yet many a better one has died before.'<br>
Then, scanning all the o'ercrowded mass, should you<br>
Perceive one face that you loved heretofore,<br>
It is a spook. None wears the face you knew.<br>
Great death has made all his for evermore.<br>

<b>Come On, My Lucky Lads</b><br>
<br>
O rosy red, O torrent splendour<br>
Staining all the Orient gloom,<br>
O celestial work of wonder -<br>
A million mornings in one bloom!<br>
<br>
What, does the artist of creation<br>
Try some new plethora of flame,<br>
For his eye’s fresh fascination?<br>
Has the old cosmic fire grown tame?<br>
<br>
In what subnatural strange awaking<br>
Is this body, which seems mine?<br>
These feet towards that blood-burst making,<br>
These ears which thunder, these hands which twine<br>
<br>
On grotesque iron? Icy-clear<br>
The air of a mortal day shocks sense,<br>
My shaking men pant after me here.<br>
The acid vapours hovering dense,<br>
<br>
The fury whizzing in dozens down,<br>
The clattering rafters, clods calcined,<br>
The blood in the flints and the trackway brown -<br>
I see I am clothed and in my right mind;<br>
<br>
The dawn but hangs behind the goal,<br>
What is that artist’s joy to me?<br>
Here limps poor Jock with a gash in the poll,<br>
His red blood now is the red I see,<br>
<br>
The swooning white of him, and that red I<br>
These bombs in boxes, the craunch of shells,<br>
The second-hand flitting round; ahead l<br>
It’s plain we were born for this, naught else.<br>

From <b>In Parenthesis</b>, Part 7<br>
<br>
But sweet sister death has gone debauched today and<br>
stalks on this high ground with strumpet confidence,<br>
makes no coy veiling of her appetite but leers from you<br>
to me with all her parts discovered.<br>
    By one and one the line gaps, where her fancy will -<br>
howsoever they may howl for their virginity<br>
she holds them - who impinge less on space<br>
sink limply to a heap<br>
nourish a lesser category of being<br>
like those other who fructify the land ...<br>
<br>
But how intolerably bright the morning is where we who<br>
are alive and remain, walk lifted up, carried forward by<br>
an effective word.<br>
<br>
But red horses now - blare every trump without<br>
economy, burn boat and sever every tie every held thing<br>
goes west and tethering snapt, bolts unshot and brass<br>
doors flung wide and you go forward, foot goes another<br>
step further.<br>
<br>
The immediate foreground sheers up, tilts toward,<br>
like an high wall falling.<br>
There she breaches black perpendiculars<br>
where the counter-barrage warms to the seventh power<br>
   where<br>
the Three Children walk under the fair morning<br>
and the Twin Brother	<br>
and the high grass soddens through your puttees<br>
and dew asperges the freshly dead . . . <br>
<br>
Mr Jenkins half inclined his head to them - he walked<br>
just barely in advance of his platoon and immediately<br>
to the left of Private Ball.<br>
   He makes the conventional sign<br>
and there is the deeply inward effort of spent tnen who<br>
   would<br>
make response for him,<br>
and take it at the double.<br>
He sinks on one knee<br>
and now on the other,<br>
his upper body tilts in rigid inclination<br>
this way and back;<br>
weighted lanyard runs out to full tether,<br>
                   swings like a pendulum<br>
                   and the clock run down.<br>
Lurched over, jerked iron saucer over tilted brow,<br>
clampt unkindly over lip and chin<br>
nor no ventaille to this darkening<br>
            and masked face-lifts to grope the air<br>
and so disconsolate;<br>
enfeebled fingering at a paltry strap -<br>
buckle holds,<br>
holds him blind against the morning . . . <br>
<br>
   His light stick-bomb winged above your thorn-bush,<br>
and aged oak-timbers shiver and leaves shower like<br>
thrown blossom for a conqueror.<br>
You tug at rusted pin -<br>
it gives unexpectedly and your fingers pressed to released<br>
flange. ·<br>
You loose the thing into the underbrush.<br>
   Dark-faceted iron oval lobs heavily to funguscushioned<br>
dank, wobbles under low leaf to lie, near<br>
where the heel drew out just now; and tough root-fibres<br>
boomerang to top-most green filigree and earth clods<br>
flung disturb fresh fragile shoots that brush the sky.<br>
   You huddle closer to your mossy bed<br>
you make yourself scarce<br>
you scramble forward and pretend not to see<br>
but ruby drops from young beech-sprigsare<br>
bright your hands and face.<br>
   And the other one cries from the breaking-buckthorn.<br>
   He calls for Elsa, for Manuela<br>
for the parish priest of Burkersdorf in Saxe Altenburg.<br>
   You grab his dropt stick-bomb as you go, but somehow<br>
you don't fancy it and anyway you forget how it works.<br>
You definitely like the coloured label on the handle,<br>
you throw it to the tall wood-weeds . . .<br>
<br>
they could quite easily train dark muzzles<br>
to fiery circuit<br>
and run with flame stabs to and fro among<br>
stammer a level traversing<br>
and get a woeful cross-section on<br>
stamen-twined and bruised pistilline<br>
steel-shorn of style and ovary<br>
leaf and blossoming<br>
with flora-spangled khaki pelvises<br>
and where rustling, where limbs thrust -<br>
                     from nurturing sun hidden,<br>
late-flowering dog-rose spray let fly like bowyer's ash,<br>
disturbed for the movement<br>
for the pressing forward, bodies in the bower<br>
where adolescence walks the shrieking wood.<br>
<br>
He watches where you lift a knee joint gingerly, to<br>
avoid low obstacles,<br>
with flexed articulation poked<br>
from young leaves parted<br>
- and plug and splinter<br>
shin and fibula<br>
and twice-dye with crimson moistening<br>
for draggled bloodwort and the madder sorrel.<br>
   And covering every small outlet and possibie sallyway<br>
and playing old harry with any individual or<br>
concerted effort of these to debouch or even get a dekko<br>
of his dispositions . . .<br>
<br>
But it's no good you cant do it with these toy spades,<br>
you want axes, heavy iron for tough anchoring roots,<br>
tendoned deep down.<br>
   When someone brought up the Jerry picks it was<br>
better, and you did manage to make some impression.<br>
And the next one to you, where he bends to delve gets<br>
it in the middle body. Private Ball is not instnlcted, and<br>
bow could you stay so fast a tide, it would be difficult<br>
with him screaming whenever you move him ever so<br>
litde, let alone try with jack-knife to cut clear the<br>
hampering cloth.<br>
The First Field Dressing is futile as frantic seaman's<br>
shift bunged to stoved bulwark, so soon the darking<br>
flood percolates and he dies in your arms.<br>
   And get back to that digging can't yer -<br>
this aint a bloody Wake<br>
           for these dead, who soon will have their dead<br>
for burial clods heaped over.<br>
Nor time for halsing<br>
nor to clip green wounds<br>
nor weeping Maries bringing anointments<br>
neither any word spoken<br>
nor no decent nor appropriate sowing of this seed<br>
nor remembrance of the harvesting<br>
of the renascent cycle<br>
and retun<br>
nor shaving of the head nor ritual incising for these<br>
<i>viriles</i> under each tree.<br>
   No one sings: Lully lully<br>
for the mate whose blood runs down.<br>
Corposant his signal flare<br>
         makes its slow parabola<br>
where acorn hanging cross-trees tangle<br>
and the leafy tops intersect.<br>
And white faces lie,<br>
(like china saucers tilted run soiling stains half dry,<br>
when the moon shines on a scullery-rack and Mr and<br>
Mrs Billington are asleep upstairs and so's Vi- and any<br>
creak frightens you) or any twig moving . . . <br>
<br>
But you seek him alive from bushment and briar -<br>
          perhaps he's where the hornbeam spreads:<br>
he finds you everywhere.<br>
Where his fiery sickle garners you:<br>
fanged-flash and darkt-fire thrring and thrrung athwart<br>
thdrill a Wimshurst pandemonium drill with dynamo<br>
druv staccato bark at you like Berthe Krupp's terrier<br>
bitch and ratdesnakes for bare legs; sweat you on the<br>
sudden like masher Bimp's back-firing No. 3 model for<br>
Granny Bodger at I .30 a.m. rrattle a chatter you like a<br>
Vitus neurotic, harrow your vertebrae, bore your brainpan<br>
before you can say Fanny - and comfortably over<br>
open sights:<br>
   the gentleman must be mowed.<br>
And to Private Ball it came as if a rigid beam of great<br>
weight flailed about his calves, caught from behind by<br>
ballista-baulk let fly or aft-beam slewed to clout gunnelwalker<br>
below below below.<br>
   When golden vanities make about,<br>
                   you've got no legs to stand on.<br>
   He thought it disproportionate in its violence<br>
considering the fragility of us.<br>
   The warm fluid percolates between his toes and his<br>
left boot fills, as when you tread in a puddle - he<br>
crawled away in the opposite direction.<br>
It's difficult with the weight of the rifle.<br>
Leave it - under the oak.<br>
Leave it for a salvage-bloke<br>
let it lie bruised for a monument<br>
dispense the authenticated fragments to the faithful . . . <br>
<br>
   Marry it man! Marry it!<br>
Cherish her, she's your very own.<br>
   Coax it man coax it - it's delicately and ingeniously<br>
made - it's an instrument of precision - it costs us<br>
tax-payers, money - I want you men to remember that.<br>
   Fondle it like a granny - talk to it - consider it as<br>
you would a friend - and when you ground these arms<br>
she's not a rooky's gas-pipe for greenhorns to tarnish.<br>
   You've known her hot and cold.<br>
You would choose her from among many.<br>
You know her by her bias, and by her exact error at<br>
300, and by the deep scar at the small, by the fair flaw<br>
in the grain, above the lower sling-swivel -<br>
but leave it under the oak . . . <br>
<br>
The secret princes between the leaning trees have<br>
diadems given them.<br>
   Life the leveller hugs her impudent equality - she<br>
may proceed at once to less discriminating zones.<br>
<br>
The Queen of the Woods has cut bright boughs of<br>
various flowering.<br>
   These knew her influential eyes. Her awarding hands<br>
can pluck for each their fragile prize.<br>
   She speaks to them according to precedence. She<br>
knows what's due to this elect society. She can choose<br>
twelve gentle-men. She knows who is most lord between<br>
the high trees and on the open down.<br>
   Some she gives white berries<br>
             some she gives brown<br>
Emil has a curious crown it's<br>
             made of golden saxifrage.<br>
   Fatty wears sweet-briar,<br>
he will reign with her for a thousand years.<br>
   For Balder she reaches high to fetch his.<br>
   Ulrich smiles for his myrtle wand.<br>
   That swine Lillywhite has daisies to his chain- you'd<br>
hardly credit it.<br>
   She plaits torques of equal splendour for Mr Jenkins<br>
and Billy Crower.<br>
   Hansel with Gronwy share dog-violets for a palm,<br>
where they lie in serious embrace beneath the twisted<br>
tripod.<br>
   Sion gets St John's Wort- that's fair enough.<br>
Dai Great-coat, she can't find him anywhere- she<br>
calls both high and low, she had a very special one for<br>
him.<br>
   Among this July noblesse she is mindful of December<br>
wood - when the trees of the forest beat against each<br>
other because of him.<br>
   She carries to Aneirin-in-the-nullah a rowan sprig,<br>
for the glory of Guenedota. You couldn't hear what she<br>
said to him, because she was careful for the Disciplines<br>
of the Wars.<br>
<br>
At the gate of the wood you try a last adjustment, but<br>
slung so, it's an impediment, it's of detriment to your<br>
hopes, you had best be rid of it - the sagging webbing<br>
and all and what's left of your two fifty - but it were<br>
wise to hold on to your mask.<br>
<br>
You're clumsy in your feebleness, you implicate your<br>
tin-hat rim with the slack sling of it.<br>
   Let it lie for the dews to rust it, or ought you to<br>
decently cover the working parts.<br>
   Its dark barrel, where you leave it under the oak,<br>
reflects the solemn star that rises urgently from Oiff<br>
Trench.<br>
   It's a beautiful doll for us<br>
it's the Last Reputable Arm.<br>
   But leave it - under the oak.<br>
leave it for a Cook's tourist to the Devastated Areas and<br>
crawl as far as you can and wait for the bearers.<br>
<br>
Mrs Willy Hartington has learned to draw sheets and so<br>
   has<br>
Miss Melpomené; and on the south lawns,<br>
men walk in red white and blue<br>
under the cedars<br>
and by every green tree<br>
and beside comfortable waters.<br>
<br>
But why dont the bastards come -<br>
Bearers! - stret-cher bear-errs!<br>
or do they divide the spoils at the Aid-Post.<br>
   But how many men do you suppose could bear away<br>
a third of us:<br>
drag just a little further - he yet may counter-attack.<br>
<br>
Lie still under the oak<br>
next to the Jerry<br>
and Sergeant Jerry Coke.<br>
   The feet of the reserves going up tread level with your<br>
forehead; and no word for you; they whisper one with<br>
another; pass on inward;<br>
these latest succours:<br>
green Kimmerii to bear up the war.<br>
<br>
Oeth and Annoeth's hosts they were<br>
who in that night grew<br>
younger men<br>
younger striplings.<br>
<br>
The geste says this and the man who was on the field<br>
. . .  and who wrote the book . . .  the man who does not<br>
know this has not understood anything.<br>

<br>
Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that<br>
   knive us ...<br>
Wearied we keep awake because the night is silent ...<br>
Low, drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient, ...<br>
Worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,<br>
             But nothing happens.<br>
<br>
Watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire,<br>
Like twitching agonies of men among its brambles.<br>
Northward incessandy, the flickering gunnery rumbles,<br>
Far off, like a dull rumour of some other war.<br>
             What are we doing here?<br>
<br>
The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow ...<br>
We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag<br>
   stormy.<br>
Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army<br>
Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,<br>
             But nothing happens.<br>
			 <br>
Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence.<br>
Less deathly than the air that shudders black with snow<br>
With sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause, and renew<br>
We watch them wandering up and down the wind's<br>
   nonchalance,<br>
             But nothing happens.<br>
			  <br>
Pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our<br>
   faces<br>
We cringe in holes back on forgotten dreams, and stare,<br>
   snow-dazed<br>
Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,<br>
Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird<br>
   fuses,<br>
             - Is it that we are dying?<br>
Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires,<br>
   glozed<br>
With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;<br>
For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;<br>
Shutters and doors, all closed: on us the doors are<br>
   closed,-<br>
             We turn back to our dying.<br>
Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires bum;<br>
Nor ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.<br>
For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;<br>
Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were<br>
   born,<br>
             For love of God seems dying.<br>
<br>
To-night, this frost will fasten on this mud and us,<br>
Shrivelling many hands, puckering foreheads crisp.<br>
The burying-party, picks and shovels in shaking grasp,<br>
Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice,<br>
             But nothing happens.<br>
			 <br>
<b>Dulce Et Decorum Est</b><br>
<br>
Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
Till on the haunting flares we turned our bacb<br>
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br>
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br>
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
Of gas shells dropping softly behind.<br>
<br>
Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumbling,<br>
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br>
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,<br>
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . .<br>
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<br>
<br>
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br>
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br>
<br>
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br>
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br>
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br>
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, -<br>
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br>
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est<br>
Pro patria mori.<br>

<b>The Sighs of the Gunner from Dakar</b><br>
<br>
In the log dugout hidden by osiers<br>
Near gray cannons turned toward the north<br>
		I dream of the African village<br>
Where we danced where we sang and made love<br>
			And made long speeches<br>
				Noble and joyful<br>
			I see again my father who fought<br>
		The Ashantis<br>
		In the service of the English<br>
			I see again my sister with the crazy laugh<br>
			With breasts hard as bombshells<br>
					And I see again<br>
		My mother the witch who alone in the village<br>
					Scorned salt<br>
			Crushing millet in a mortar<br>
		I remember the fetish so delicate so disturbing<br>
		In the tree<br>
		And the double fetish of fecundity<br>
		Later a severed head<br>
		Beside a swamp<br>
		Oh paleness of my enemy<br>
		It was a silver head<br>
			And in the marsh<br>
		The moon was shining<br>
		It was it was a silver head<br>
		The moon above was dancing<br>
		It was it was a silver head<br>
		And I in the cave was invisible<br>
It was it was a Negro head in the dead of night<br>
			Resemblances Pallors<br>
			And later my sister<br>
			Went off with a rifleman<br>
					Who was killed at Arras<br>
					If I wanted to know my age<br>
						I'd have to ask the bishop<br>
						So gentle so gentle to my mother<br>
						So like butter like butter with my sister<br>
						It was in a little hut<br>
Neater than our gunners' dugout<br>
					I've known the hiding place at the swamp's edge<br>
					Where the giraffe drinks with legs spread apart<br>
I've known the horror of the enemy that plunder<br>
									The Village<br>
								Rape the women<br>
								Lead away the girls<br>
And the boys whose hard rumps quiver<br>
I've guided the administrator for weeks<br>
				From village to village<br>
					Singing<br>
		And I was a servant in Paris<br>
								I don't know my age<br>
								But at the recruiting<br>
								They wrote down twenty years old<br>
		I'm a French soldier and so they turned me white<br>
		Sector 59 I can't say where<br>
But why is it better to be white than black<br>
		Why not dance and make speeches<br>
					Eat and then sleep<br>
		And we shoot at the Boche supplies<br>
		Or at the iron wires in front of the doughboys<br>
		Under the metallic storm<br>
			I remember a hideous lake<br>
		And couples chained by an atrocious love<br>
				A crazy night<br>
			A night of sorcery<br>
			Like tonight<br>
		Where so many horrible eyes<br>
		Explode in the brilliant sky<br>

<b>July 1914</b><br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
All month a smell of burning, of dry peat<br>
smouldering in the bogs.<br>
Even the birds have stopped singing,<br>
the aspen does not tremble.<br>
<br>
The god of wrath glares in the sky,<br>
the fields have been parched since Easter.<br>
A one-legged pilgrim stood in the yard<br>
with his mouth full of prophecies:<br>
<br>
‘Beware of terrible times . . . the earth<br>
opening for a crowd of corpses.<br>
Expect famine, earthquakes, plagues,<br>
and heavens darkened by eclipses.<br>
<br>
‘But our land will not be divided<br>
by the enemy at his pleasure:<br>
the Mother-of-God will spread<br>
a white shroud over these great sorrows.’<br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
From the burning woods drifts<br>
the sweet smell of juniper.<br>
Widows grieve over their brood,<br>
the village rings with their lamentation.<br>
<br>
If the land thirsted, it was not in vain,<br>
nor were the prayers wasted;<br>
for a warm red rain soaks<br>
the trampled fields.<br>
<br>
Low, low hangs the empty sky,<br>
tender is the voice of the supplicant:<br>
‘They wound Thy most holy body,<br>
They are casting lots for Thy garments.’<br>
<br>
<i>Slepnevo, 20 July 1914</i><br>
