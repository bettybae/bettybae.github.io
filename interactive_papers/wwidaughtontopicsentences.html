Trench papers were generally encouraged, as is indicated by an 8 March 1916 circular from General Joffre, because they attempted to boost morale. Official censorship was enforced, though sporadically; self-censorship within newspaper staffs was more likley, as editors used their best judgement in deciding what was inappropriate to print. Similarly, though many articles targeted official “eyewash,” trench papers were not totally free of propaganda. See Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, 20-33.

However, the term, based upon the soldiers’ hair, became a metaphor for a wider political spirit, through concepts of masculinity and participation in the discourse of the French Republic.</b><br><br><b>The Hairy Ones</b><br><br>The literal translation of Le Poilu is “the hairy one” and it is used as an informal collective term to describe the men who made up the French infantry soldiers during the First World War. However, it is also representative of a national and political identity which these men embraced as both a reaction to the war and their own conception of republican France.<br><br>At its most basic level, the term Poilu refers to the appearance of the regular French infantryman. It became custom for French soldiers to grow their hair and beards long at the outbreak of the war as an expression of their masculinity. The term first rose to wider prominence in the 1834 story by Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850), Le Médecin de Campagne. In the novel, a highly dangerous mission requires the participation of a group of French soldiers with only forty men being deemed hairy enough to undertake it.<br><br>Hair as a signifier for masculinity and strength has its roots in the biblical tale of Samson, but with Le Poilu it found an additional resonance in regards to the way the First World War was waged and the reasons behind it. The nature of trench warfare, with soldiers rapidly coming to live a semi-subterranean life within the mud and dirt of La Patrie, convinced French soldiers that it was not possible to fight such a conflict without embracing this mud and dirt. It was not possible to save the country they loved without immersing themselves in its very ground, by becoming dirty, and hairy, and embracing a sense of base masculinity.<br><br>This position often put them at odds with British soldiers in particular, as the British soldierly identity of the “Tommy” was heavily predicated on the importance of a clean appearance in maintaining discipline and fostering a military spirit. As a result, to British eyes, the French often appeared unkempt and ill-disciplined.<br><br>Additionally, this manifestation of the French warrior spirit also links back to the French rural tradition of men working the fields and the soil of La Patrie in a manner that speaks of both an honest masculinity but also a deep love and appreciation of France as the mother and sustainer of the French people. Beyond this, it also gave an outlet for the expression of the republican identity these men created for themselves.<br><br><b>Les Poilus and Republican Identity</b><br><br>Since the earliest days of the French Revolution, Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s (1712-1778) declaration; “Every soldier a citizen, every citizen a soldier” has described the binary relationship between the people of France and their role in its preservation and defense. However, this relationship is also one of community, participation and debate. The soldiers of the First World War did not view themselves as passive pieces in this situation, devoid of opinion or agency. Les Poilus were fighting for France and they had very particular beliefs about what “France” represented and how best it would be defended.<br><br>These positions became clear during the French mutinies of 1917 during and after the failed offensive at the Chemin des Dames. When it became clear that General Robert Nivelle (1856-1924), then French commander-in-chief, was not going to secure a decisive victory and that French casualties were rapidly growing, reports began to surface of French soldiers baa-ing like sheep on their way to slaughter as they passed up the lines towards the battle. This movement spread in a wider display of political dissent as soldiers in the area refused to attack. Their message to the French military command was that they would continue to defend the land of their country but they were not willing to cast away their lives in a pointless offensive.<br><br>On the surface, this might appear a simple act of non-political mutiny. However, Les Poilus viewed themselves to be the descendants of those republican soldiers who had built modern France; they believed that both the country and its citizen-soldiers deserved better than death in attempting the unachievable. It was only by addressing the political motivations of these mutinies that General Philippe Pétain (1856-1951), Nivelle’s replacement, was able to rebuild the morale and fighting effectiveness of the French army. These measures allowed the French infantry to play a crucial role in the eventual victory of 1918, not simply through their own strength of arms, but through achieving it in a manner that was compatible with their own identity and belief in what the war was for and how it must be fought.<br><br><b>Post-war</b><br><br>Whilst the eventual victory had been sufficiently Poilu-esque, and many of those who had served in the French army continued to take pride in their wartime identity, many soldiers began to look outwards in their desire to maintain the peace they had won. The rise of internationalism saw many former Poilus attempt to foster cooperation between the various combatants during the inter-war years. The eventual failure of this attempt followed by the defeat of the French army in 1940 meant that the Poilu identity did not reemerge as a cohesive movement during the Second World War.<br><br>Chris Kempshall, University of Sussex<br><br><b>Section Editor:</b> Alexandre Lafon<br><br><b>Selected Bibliography</b><br><br>Audoin-Rouzeau, Stéphane / Becker, Annette: 1914-1918.

(1) On a cool morning in the early autumn of 1915, a French infantryman leaves his post at the western front for a few days at home, <i>en permission</i>. The <i>poilu</i>’s eyes remain fixed on the trenches as he walks away. He takes with him heavy souvenirs of battle: German helmets, weapons, and a large, unexploded shell. By evening, he arrives at the homefront, in the midst of his previous life, where his wife and children excitedly await his train. The wife hugs and kisses her husband while the younger children fight for their father’s attention; the aloof order son, proudly donning his father’s cap, is fascinated with a real shell brought from the front. At home, with the children asleep, the wife puts on her nightgown, climbs into bed and awaits her husband. She seductively props her head on thick pillows and awaits her husband, then gasps when she notices him, fully-clothed, already asleep on the floor beside the bed. The next morning, the <i>poilu</i> entertains himself by playing with his children. But when the play gets rough, the soldier takes out his rifle, and brandishes a dagger. Losing control of himself, he kicks a chair, and knocks the couch over, pinning his son beneath it. His wife yells at him to stop, and chases him out of the house. Later that afternoon, while peacefully working in the garden, the wife smells a terrible stench. She takes hold of her child when she notices the <i>poilu</i> hunched behind some potted plans, defecating in the <i>feuillées</i>. The next day, the <i>poilu</i> returns to the front. Having left his war souvenirs at home, the <i>poilu</i> carries supplies for his battalion and a couple bottles of wine.<br>

<br>

<br>
(9) Three aspects of <i>poilu mentalité</i> were especially well depicted in trench cartoons. First, trench cartoons were not limited to a portrayal of trench life as a one-dimensional, never-ending life of misery. The monotony interspersed with terror which characterized much of trench life was relieved occasionally in periods of rest, trips home, and even dreams. Cartoons defined the <i>poilu</i>, and portrayed his daily thoughts and feelings in a variety of activities, from hand-to-hand combat to getting drunk. Although the image of the <i>poilu</i> was common in national publications, trench cartoonists created a more socially and psychologically nuanced version of the <i>poilu</i> than the boyish, playful image of the homefront.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> Second, cartoons suggest that <i>poilus</i> made moral judgements about themselves, the enemy, the allies, colonial soldiers, and various members and activities of the homefront.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> In conceptualizing <i>poilu</i> moral values, the metaphor of geography is instructive. In trench cartoons, the <i>poilu</i> was held in highest esteem, morally righteous, risking his life, defending the nation. The importance of the <i>poilu</i>’s role as soldier was never questioned. Cartoonists most clearly establish this by using the enemy as a foil. Beyond the trenches, however, <i>poilus</i> envisioned a range of moral value based on citizens’ distance—in both mind and body—from the front. In general, those who supported the war effort in practice and spirit were revered in trench cartoons, while those who feared or ignored it were ridiculed. Within this scheme, there were further distinctions, shaped in part by considerations of class, gender, and less commonly, race. For example, as will be shown in more detail, cartoonists did not treat even the most frivolous women of the homefront as vindictively as their wealthy, male <i>embusqué</i> counterparts. In this sense, cartoons broke down the apparent dichotomy of front <i>versus</i> homefront into more subtle moral categories. And third, even though trench cartoons chastised the fun-loving ways of urban elites, they also celebrated, if not exalted, the very comforts of civilization the elites enjoyed. The luxury of home life represented both a tool with which to critique the indifferent civilian, and an object of <i>poilu</i> desires and even fantasies. Although cartoons functions very differently from official propaganda, they in some cases shared similar ends. Trench cartoons did not glorify the war experience, nor did they rely on simple symbols such as <i>devoir</i> or even <i>La France</i>. But, morally, in cartoons and propaganda alike, the <i>poilu</i> symbolized a national moral ideal. And, further, by reproducing images of civilization, <b>(p.41)</b> represented not by national icons, but by the simple comforts of civilian life, cartoons reminded <i>poilus</i> of the necessity of war in terms they could appreciate, encouraging them to continue fighting.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.1] The Enemy: A Foil Unquestioned by Soldiers and Propagandists Alike</b><br>
<br>
(10) Representations of the enemy in trench cartoons suggests that <i>poilus</i> did not dismiss all of the characterizations of official propaganda. Both cartoons and propaganda treated the enemy as a foil to the righteousness of the <i>poilu</i>. This similarity reveals the difficulties in separating the representations <i>bourrage de crâne</i> from what might be considered more “authentic” <i>poilu</i> representations. Cartoons about the enemy commonly depicted German soldiers as barbaric and dishonest criminals, or as stupid weaklings, lacking the discipline to fight. For example, <i>Le Petit Echo du 18e Territorial</i> (no 65, 6 Feb. 1915) printed three drawings of German treachery: a blimp raiding a town, a German submarine prowling the oceans, and a smiling German soldier walking away from a child he has just shot. In another issue of the same paper (no 58, 19 Dec. 1915), German diplomatic cunning was depicted in a drawing of Kaiser “Guillaume” offering a “dishonest proposition” of Peace (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">Figure 2</a>). This Peace is not the traditional female icon of youth, grace and beauty, but a pudgy old woman, battered, missing an arm and a leg. Around her neck hangs the German iron cross, and her skirt is decorated with skulls and bones. Behind “Guillaume’s” back is the blunt tool used to shape this Peace. These cartoons particularly resemble official propaganda because they play on the fears, not of the <i>poilu</i>, but of the nation: the vicious German troops, the wily German government. The victims of German aggression are not soldiers, but rather the nation and its civilians, particularly women and children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> But by victimizing only the innocent, the <i>poilu</i> was the unmentioned savior of these cartoons—honorable, brave, just. The soldier was not motivated by self-interest, defending himself. Rather, the <i>poilu</i> was selfless, the nation’s defender, symbolizing France’s hope.<br>
<br>
(11) Other cartoons drew on familiar generalizations and symbols of national differences in order to contrast morally and culturally the two sides at war.<br>
<br>
(12) The helpless buffoon was another common type used in representing the German soldier.<br>
<br>
(13) Even though some cartoons resembled propagandists’ images of the enemy, trench cartoonists often embellished these types with subject matter important to <i>poilus</i>. Trench cartoons like “The influence of the <i>delikatessen</i>” spoke to an exclusively <i>poilu</i> anxiety: the fear of German weapons technology. The carnage and butchery of modern warfare caused anger and despair in the trenches. One machine gun equaled the fire power of sixty men with repeating rifles; hand grenades and artillery could kill a number of men at once; mustard gas blistered the skin and lungs, and caused temporary blindness.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> In a cartoon with the caption “Fritz goes little by little” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">Figure 4</a>) in <i>Le Gafouilleur</i> (no 26, 1 May 1917) these fears were projected onto the enemy. Here, “Fritz” is being blown apart, piece by piece. In this sense, the cartoon was a kind of rallying cry, encouraging men to keep fighting, suggesting that it was just a matter of time before Fritz was either fully dismembered, or retreated. But rather than using traditional images of <i>devoir</i> and honor, this cartoon appealed to soldiers’ own understanding of war. Maurice Genevoix’s <i>Les Eparges</i> uses imagery eerily similar to the cartoon’s: “Increasingly often, as we became more weary, feverish images were thrown up among the shell bursts: of jumping up with our bodies in fragments; of falling back onto the parapet with broken backs . . . ; of being headless, our heads torn off in a single blow, like Grondin . . . whose head came rolling down to us. . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> The cartoon’s graphic violence contrasts with the lyrical caption beneath it, a nostalgic axiom about departure:<br>
<blockquote>To leave is to die a little<br>
We leave a bit of ourselves<br>
Always and everywhere. . . . </blockquote>
In the context of Fritz’s predicament, “to leave a bit of oneself” is no metaphor. Although this cartoon expressed anxieties specific to <i>poilus</i>, it also offered hope: the imminent destruction of the enemy. Though cartoons such as this did not exhibit the false optimism of eyewash, the <i>message</i> of trench cartoons about the enemy was <b>(p.45)</b> little different from the official propaganda: the <i>Boches</i> are cunning and murderous, or stupid and misguided, and they threaten the French nation. Either conception justified their defeat by the superior “civilization” of the French. <i>Poilus</i>, therefore, clearly did not dismiss all assumptions of official propagandists. But trench cartoons were not simply propaganda; rather, they employed and adapted types popular in the wider, national community, and recontextualized them by giving them new forms that spoke more directly to veterans of the front, appealing to their sensibilities. Unlike propagandists, whose pro-French message was the end in itself, trench cartoonists employed images of the enemy as foils in order to begin to define the complexities of <i>poilu</i> identity, especially the <i>poilu</i>’s moral position.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.2] The <i>Poilu</i> and the Trench Community</b><br>
<br>
(14) If the <i>Boches</i> were clearly defined by trench and “official” images as bloodthirsty and hateful, then who was the <i>poilu</i>? In national typology and trench cartoons alike, <b>(p.46)</b> the french soldier represented values in opposition to the enemy: the <i>poilu</i> was brave, self-sacrificing, honorable—the defenders of the nation. But it is clear from other trench cartoons that <i>poilu</i> self-perception was not limited to national expectations. Trench cartoons portray the attitudes, fears and desires not of heroes, but of ordinary men. The <i>poilu mentalité</i> was shaped not by individual social or economic background, or political views, but by experiences, emotions, and thoughts shared in the first line, in reserve trenches, <i>au repos</i>, and <i>en permission</i>. Trench cartoons gave meaning to, and perpetuated a coherent definition of the trench community.<br>
<br>
(15) Trench cartoons, like other sources from the trenches, were apolitical: military decisions were never questioned, and national politics rarely critiqued.<br>
<br>
(16) Class differences among <i>poilus</i>, including distinctions between peasants and urbanites, are rare mentioned.<br>
<br>
(17) One distinction, however, is made clear in trench cartoons: the <i>poilu</i> is French and white.<br>
<br>
(18) Most trench cartoons illustrated the <i>poilu</i> without using foils such as colonial soldiers, often by simply listing <i>poilu</i> attitudes and desires.<br>
<br>
(19) But <i>repos</i> was infrequently depicted in terms of hardship: a cartoon in <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (no 22, 5 September 1917) shows <i>repos</i> to be a time of comradeship and relaxation.<br>
<br>
(20) Along with the pleasures of free time, the hardships of trench conditions was a central trench cartoon theme.<br>
<br>
(21) Cartoonists also often depicted the fear of mutilation in humorous and often strikingly frank terms.<br>
<br>
(22) Cartoons which focused on <i>poilu</i> life at the front offer a stark contrast to those which portrayed the enemy in often propaganda-like ways. Trench cartoons defined <i>poilus</i> as members of an inclusive group of white French men forced to live in harsh <b>(p.52)</b> conditions at the front. References to the enemy and non-French, non-white allies depicted <i>poilus</i> in opposition to savagery and stupidity. But it is through the depiction of communal activities that cartoons reveal the more complex, even contradictory attitudes and anxieties of the <i>poilu</i>. While cartoons dealing with the enemy did not deny the importance and moral respectability of the <i>poilu</i>, cartoons about the difficulties of trench life inherently rejected any suggestion that the task of the soldier was an enviable one. In fact, they at times defiantly asserted the devastating consequences of honor and duty. Images of vermin and mutilation, though both amusing and disturbing, can be interpreted as responses to the playful and carefree <i>poilu</i> of homefront publications. But trench cartoons were not defeatist. Through humour, cartoons reinforced the belief that trench conditions could be survived by ridiculing, and even laughing at rats, lice, fatigue, and mutilation. What emerged from these cartoons was a set of sensibilities, more complex than and potentially subversive to the simplified conception of the front found in national propaganda.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.3] <i>Embusqués</i>: Men Outside the Trench Community</b><br>
<br>
(23) The attitudes and sensibilities of the <i>poilu</i> community were delineated in cartoons about trench life. Yet the limits of the boundaries of this trench community <b>(p.53)</b> were more fully distinguished by references to frenchmen outside it. Trench cartoons scorned French men who were perceived by <i>poilus</i> to have shirked their responsibility to the nation by not fighting. These cowards were deemed <i>embusqués</i>. During the Great War, <i>embusqué</i> meant anyone who, in the eyes of <i>poilus</i>, had a good post, a safe job. As François Déchelette suggests in his dictionary of <i>poilu</i> slang, an <i>embusqué</i> could have included just about anyone, depending on who made the accusation. The the <i>poilu</i> in a heavily shelled area, a soldier in a less dangerous area might have been called <i>embusqué</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Cartoons depicting <i>embusqués</i>, therefore, were morally weighted, assigning values corresponding to men’s involvement in the war effort. For example, on the cover of <i>Le Mouchoir</i> (no 27, 28 May 1916) two <i>poilus</i> watch as a sophisticated, higher-ranking soldier walks by with a woman on his arm. One <i>poilu</i> says to the other, pointing to the passing soldier’s decorations: “My stripes [for continued service]? . . . There they are.” The implication of this cartoon is that this soldier has not earned his promotion, though he enjoys the benefits of his status (women in cartoons are invariably attracted to higher ranking men). To these <i>poilus</i>, whose tattered uniforms show the hardship they have experienced, the soldier with the woman is an <i>embusqué</i>. The suggestion here is that his rank affords him greater access to the comfort of the homefront, as well as greater protection from the dangers of battle. Another cartoon contrasts raining shells at the front with an officer’s fear of getting wet in the rain on the homefront. Holding out his hand to feel the drizzle, the officer says to a woman on his arm, “Yes, my dear, it’s awful when it rains.” (<i>Le 3ème Bataillon</i>, no 24, 12 November 1915) In <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (no 16, 1 January 1917) an officer <i>embusqué</i> was defined in a cartoon “in which we see the life of the <i>poilu</i> and that of the <i>embusqué</i>.” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">Figure 9</a>) Stark contrasts are drawn between the activities of daily life: the <i>poilu</i> awakes in a flooded trench, while the officer is brought coffee to his warm bed; the <i>poilu</i> gnaws on a bone to the sound of exploding shells, while the officer eats in a restaurant entertained with music: “Le spectacle” means look-out for the <i>poilu</i>, but a night at the theater for the <i>embusqué</i>. During “l’offensive,” the soldier disembowels the enemy, while the city-dweller grabs a waitress from behind. Rank alone certainly did not denote one’s status as an <i>embusqué</i>. The stripes that each of these <i>embusqués</i> wears were also found adorning the sleeves of many <i>poilus</i> in trench cartoons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> But rank in these particular cartoons was depicted in terms of a class difference as well. The <i>embusqué</i> in <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> possesses the standard visual elements of the French <i>haute bourgeois</i> typology: he is well-dressed and groomed, has a prominent profile, even a monocle. His tastes are sophisticated: violin music with dinner, then a night out at the the theater. He eventually hunts down the traditional object of many a bourgeois fantasy: a barmaid.<br>
<br>
(24) Class distinctions were also prevalent in representations of the most hated <i>embusqué</i>: the wealthy, secure civilian.<br>
<br>
(25) Another way of lampooning civilian ignorance of trench conditions is the cartoon about civilian visits to the trenches.<br>
<br>
(26) Civilian ambivalence to the war effort was a source of strong resentment for the <i>poilu</i>.<br>
<br>
(27) If indeed there were an “enemy to the rear” in the mind of the <i>poilu</i>, cartoons suggest that it was the villainous wealthy <i>embusqué</i>: he represented weakness, fear, incompetence. One cartoon depicted this weakness in a simple caricature of a large dog chasing a small, aristocratic-looking pure breed, saying “Get out, <i>embusqué</i>!” (<i>L’Echo des Marmites</i>, no 10, 25 April 1916) This <i>embusqué</i> was a foil against which the <i>poilu</i> was defined as a common man, who understood duty, served the nation, and resigned himself to self-sacrifice. In this sense, cartoons of the civilian <i>embusqué</i> generally critiqued the frivolous ways of the homefront, while they also defined the <i>poilu</i> as admirable, morally superior. The civilian <i>embusqué</i> presented in trench cartoons represented wealth and comfort: he is the civil servant, the politician’s son who stays behind, letting others do the dirty work. There were indeed many men like this. But there were also men who were taken from the trenches to perform essential tasks, such as skilled workers who assembled armaments for the war effort. They, too, were certainly <i>embusqués</i> by definition.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> But the image of the working-class life did not offer the details trench cartoonists sought when depicitng the homefront. Soldiers despised the wealthy <i>embusqué</i> for having access to what they could only dream of: women, entertainment, a home, comfort—the symbols of civilization.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.4] The Elusive Woman: Object of <i>Poilu</i> Dreams, Source of Frustration</b><br>
<br>
(28) Even though cartoons about the <i>embusqué</i> described the frustrations associated with trench life and the inequities of military service, they alone did not offer a complete picture of <i>poilu</i> attitudes toward the homefront. Other apsects of the homefront were central to <i>poilu</i> morale at the front. As a cartoon from <i>Poil et Plume</i> (no 13, August 1918) points out, the <i>poilu</i>’s “goals of war” were to receive letters and, better still, packages sent from home. And the best goal of all to win was <i>la perme</i> <b>(p.57)</b> (leave to go home). Mail was so revered by <i>poilus</i> that the “blessed mailman” is eternalized in stained glass in the “Church of the front” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">Figure 11</a>) in a cartoon from <i>Le Ver Luisant</i> (no 13, November 1916). The bearded, saint-like <i>poilu</i> wears a long gown and showers letters and packages upon soldiers, sowing happiness throughout the trenches. When no mail arrived for the <i>poilu</i>, memories of the homefront penetrated his dreams. One cartoon from <i>Le Petit Echo du 18e Territorial</i> (no 81, 28 May 1916) contrasts trench realities with fantasies about home: rats sniff around a napping <i>poilu</i>’s head, but in his dreams he sees beautiful dancers; as a cloud of mustard gas wafts into the trenches, he imagines the intoxicating smells of a home-cooked meal; he feels himself curled in a feather bed, not the hard cot on which he sleeps; and instead of the stench of latrines, he smells imaginary flowers. This cartoon works by contrasting the debilitating hardships of trench life—rats, gas, harsh living conditions—with the mundane comforts of homefront, such as hot food, a bed, flowers, But it also reveals the <i>poilu</i>’s tenacity to keep the homefront in his thoughts, even under the most trying circumstances. <br>
<br>
(29) Perhaps better than any other, cartoons about women reveal the complexities of the <i>poilu</i>’s perception of the war and the homefront.<br>
<br>
(30) Leave from the trenches allowed <i>poilus</i> to return to the “civilized” world where they could sleep soundly, spend time in cafes, and, most importantly of all, interact with women.<br>
<br>
(31) This symbolic woman was, however, rarely accessible to the <i>poilu</i>, and many jokes were wrought from soldiers’ fantasies ending in disaster or frustration.<br>
<br>
(32)Women’s ignorance of the <i>poilu</i>’s war experience was also recognized in cartoons, but often with an ambiguous moral message.<br>
<br>
(33) Cartoons such as this demonstrate women’s inability to comprehend even the more mundane aspects of trench life, and are another example of soldiers’ concern about the degeneration of their personal habits and hygiene.<br>
<br>
(34) But trench cartoons did not lampoon even ignorant women with the same harshness as the male <i>embusqué</i>.<br>
<br>
(35) After the <i>poilu</i> himself, women were the most complex characters in trench cartoons, inhabiting an ambiguous space in the geography of the <i>poilu</i>’s imagination. On the one hand, they represented the antithesis of the war: they were beautiful and alluring, refined and gentle. This image of the woman, with her perfume-bottle delicacy, was far removed from the world of rats, lice and shells; they were out of the <i>poilu</i>’s reach, both literally and figuratively. She was the symbol of the homefront—a distant place accessible only through letters, packages and the too infrequent leave. But in another sense, women were also constantly <i>with</i> the <i>poilu</i>, especially in fantasies and dreams. The miseries of trench life did not extinguish the image of the woman from the <i>poilu</i>’s mind. Rather, throughout the war, she remained a symbol central to the <i>poilu</i>’s self-definition and his assessment of the psychological impact of the war. Her centrality meant she often reflected a variety of soldiers’ anxieties. Women who failed to understand the rigors of the trench experience were a source of <i>poilu</i> frustration; although the <i>poilu</i> did not expect her, and in many case, did not want her to comprehend it. For trench cartoons suggest that soldiers judged a woman’s moral value not by her active support of the war effort—for example, in her role as a munitions worker. Rather, poilus judged a woman on how faithful and dedicated, that is, how close in mind if not in body, she remained to her <i>poilu</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.5] The View from the Trenches: An Enemy to the Rear?</b><br>
<br>
(36) A number of cultural historians have argued that the “us <i>versus</i> them” mentality of battle led soldiers in the Great War to understand the conflict as a series of gross dichotomies, such as army <i>versus</i> army, trenches <i>versus</i> homefront. Further, the ineptitude of military officials and the callous indifference of the civilian population drove soldiers to imagine “an enemy to the rear.” Some historians have also argued that soldiers conceptualized the front and homefront in terms of gendered zones: the front represented a male world, the homefront, a female one.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> In the French case, where soldiers fought on their own soil for the duration of the war, a strict dichotomy is difficult to imagine. Unlike British or German troops, for many Frenchmen, the homefront was within walking distance of the front lines; and considering the extent to which the German army advanced into France at the start of the war, for some French soldiers, “home” was in fact behind enemy lines. Trench cartoons <b>(p.62)</b> reveal the complexities and contradictions of the physical and symbolic relation between the French front line and the homefront during the Great War. Rather than solidify the dichotomy of trench and homefront, these cartoons depicted overlapping systems of interaction—both real and imagined—between the <i>poilu</i> and his home.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> Though cartoons did define the enemy as a menacing, murderous force, they portrayed the homefront with far more subtlety and ambiguity. The community of <i>poilus</i> was often closed, especially to the likes of <i>embusqués</i> and non-white colonial troops. But the life of the soldier that emerges in trench cartoons is not one easily associated with dichotomies. Life int he trenches was neither one of undying dedication and heroism, as propaganda often insisted, nor one of unending physical misery and social isolation. The <i>poilu</i> was familiar with a variety of occupations and pastimes, from combat to digging latrines, and from playing games to getting drunk on cheap wine. Cartoons also often blurred the physical barriers between home and front. Cartoons often portrayed the daily interactions of soldiers with the civilian life just behind the lines: one <i>poilu</i> buying tobacco from a shopkeeper, another waving to girls on a passing train. And soldiers always celebrated the tangible evidence of more distant homes, such as mail, packages, and especially going on leave. The visual element of cartoons also made them particularly effective at recreating <i>poilu</i>’s imaginary world where front and homefront often mingled: in dreams and fantasies, the smells, sounds, and sensations of home lived in the trenches. The pain and monotony of combat made even the simplest comforts of home more real and more cherished than before the war.<br>
<br>
(37) Trench cartoons also reveal a distinct moral code, though not one based on clear dichotomies.<br>
<br>
(38) The argument that soldiers saw an “enemy to the rear” raises another question about the motivation of troops in the trenches: what motivated <i>poilus</i> to continue fighting a long and devastating war for a homefront which appeared unconcerned with their sacrifices? Official propaganda and the <i>bourrage de crâne</i> published in national newspapers angered and further alienated soldiers.<br>
<br>
(39) Although cartoons do not provide a complete answer to these questions, they do suggest at least one way in which soldiers made sense of the war experience and motivated themselves to continue their efforts.<br>
<br>
(40) Trench cartoons, therefore, reveal two separate, and sometimes contradictory attitudes of the <i>poilu</i>.<br>
<br>
(41) Trench cartoons perpetuated an image of moral pride for <i>poilus</i>, and continually reminded <i>poilus</i> of their role as defenders of France. This does not mean that cartoons were the sole motivating factor which kept men in the trenches of the Great War. Trench cartoons do suggest, however, that <i>poilus</i> found their own ways of encouraging and motivating themselves. <i>Poilus</i> might have withstood the detrimental experiences of the trenches, not simply with patriotism or a sense of <i>devoir</i>, but by joking together about the ignorance of the homefront, sharing <i>pinard</i>, jeering the <i>embusqué</i>, or by dreaming of the simple comforts of the home life they left behind. This helps explain the popularity of a number of cultural products created within the trench community, such as songs, newspapers, stories, and cartoons. Rather than simple distractions, these were means of expression which enabled soldiers to define and understand their roles and anxieties in an alien and dangerous environment where preexisting cultural references no longer worked. The trench cartoon, with humor, satire and ridicule at its base, was a perfect cultural medium to represent a range of contradictory <i>poilu</i> attitudes. By transforming tragedy into a harmless caricature, and emotional devastation into a quick laugh, the cartoon helped <i>poilus</i> make sense of the indescribable destruction of the war around them. <br>

Trench papers were generally encouraged, as is indicated by an 8 March 1916 circular from General Joffre, because they attempted to boost morale. Official censorship was enforced, though sporadically; self-censorship within newspaper staffs was more likley, as editors used their best judgement in deciding what was inappropriate to print. Similarly, though many articles targeted official “eyewash,” trench papers were not totally free of propaganda. See Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, 20-33. Further, with trench journalism, as with memoirs and diaries, there remain questions of authorship and authenticity.

11. For example, Leonard Smith notes that “after a month of nearly constant maneuver and combat, the 5e DI took part in a total of only thirty-five days of pitched battles over the next seventeen months of the war, primarily in two attacks at Neuville-St. Vaast in the spring and fall of 1915.” <i>Between Mutiny and Obedience</i>, 74.<br>

<br>
13. It is interesting that moral character was so central to cartoons considering that French moral superiority to the enemy was perhaps the most common theme in printed official propaganda. See Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, “’Bourrage de Crâne’ et Information en France en 1914-1918,” in Jean-Jacques Becker and S. Audoin-Rouzeau (eds.), <i>Les Sociétés Européennes et la Guerre de 1914-1918</i> (Nanterre: Publications de l’Université de Nanterre, 1990), 165-166.<br>

20. Criticism was not accepted from the civilian press, either. The government shut down papers which questioned military strategy or criticized internal politics. Ross F. Collins, “The Development of Censorship in World War I France”, Journalism Monographs 131 (February 1992): 12.<br>

22. Englander, “The French Soldier,” 57. French soldiers feared the presence of English and American soldiers for the same reasons. One cartoon explicitly represents the perceived sexual conquest of the English. In <i>Le Tord-Boyau</i> (no 16, December 1917), a French woman is asked by military authorities if the English left anything behind. “Yes, sir, this!” she says, holding up a baby. It is interesting to note that while <i>poilus</i> feared the allies impregnating French women, a heated debate was taking place on the homefront over what to do with “children of the enemy”—babies born as a result of alleged German rape. See Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>L’Enfant de l’ennemi (1914-1918): Viol, avortement, infanticide pendant la Grande Guerre</i> (Paris: Aubier, 1995).<br>

24. A Private Legentil, Class of 1916, described in his diary the socializing between soldiers during periods out of the trenches: “We got to know the old-timers of the section, who were quite few, having left many comrades on the slopes of the fort of Douaumont.” These old-timers, Legentil says, spent much of their free time getting drunk.

31. Although Audoin-Rouzeau examines soldiers’ complex responses to the national press, he argues that a “national sentiment” ultimately kept them fighting. Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, pp. 182-188. For the importance of patriotism, <i>devoir</i>, and comradeship, see Modris Ektseins, <i>Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age</i> (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1989), chp. 5; for a revision to some of some common assumptions, see L.L. Farrat, Jr., “Nationalism in Wartime: Critiquing the Conventional Wisdom,” in Frans Coetzee and Marilyn Shevin-Coetzee (Eds.), <i>Authority, Identity and the Social History of the Great War</i> (Providence: Berghahn Books, 1995), 133-152.<br>

32. Some <i>poilus</i> may have never known these comforts, as they were commonly associated with urban, bourgeois society. But they remained the symbols of French civilization. See Eugen Weber, <i>Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1870-1914</i> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1976), 486.<br>
