<b>Introduction:<br>
Going Indochinese?</b>
<br><br>
Few in Vietnam today could ever imagine belonging to an
Indochinese nation, of holding an Indochinese passport, of
actually being Indochinese. If one were to put the question to
a shopper in downtown Hanoi in 2011 or to a classroom of high school
students in Saigon, I’m sure they would return a look of bewilderment or
just simply laugh. Are you out of your mind? This has certainly been my
experience. True, older Vietnamese will recall that Vietnam was once a
part of the colonial state named French Indochina. Others can remember
vaguely the importance of “Indochinese solidarity” in the combined
struggle with the Laotians and Cambodians against the French, the
Americans, and the Chinese. Few, however, would ever admit to the
possibility of “going Indochinese”.
<br><br>
That “Vietnam” takes precedence over “Indochina” today is hardly
surprising. Of the estimated 90 million people living in Vietnam as of
mid-July 2011, the vast majority never knew the colonial period or the
wars for Indochina. A quarter of the current population is under 15
years of age; its average age is 28.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> Having been born in or after 1983,
half of the Vietnamese population has never experienced the existence
of two Vietnamese nation-states, one in the south, the other in the
north. For the vast majority of those living in the Socialist Republic of
Vietnam (SRV ) today, “Vietnam” is the real and authentic manifestation
of cultural identity and statehood. And the roots of this national identity
are located in a faraway past, premised on a long tradition of resistance
to foreign domination. This is what every little Vietnamese learns in
school.
<br><br>
<b>(p.2)</b>
<br><br>
I certainly had no initial reason to contest this version of the national
past when I first began studying Vietnam and the Vietnamese
language in the late 1980s. Given the suffering the Vietnamese people
had endured against so many invaders, who was I to suggest that the
Vietnamese were perhaps not quite so Vietnamese? Second, as a young
American in the 1980s interested in working on the colonial and war
periods, I was very much aware of the battles among Vietnamese and
especially non-Vietnamese scholars, politicians, and journalists over the
legitimacy of foreign intervention in Vietnam. Added to this was the fact
that the war for Indochina was still not over as I entered the academic
field. The outbreak of a third conflagration in 1979, this time between
former communist brothers-in-arms, lasted throughout the 1980s. I
was studying Vietnamese in Hanoi in 1988 when Hanoi implemented
its policy of economic liberalization (<i>doi moi</i>) and began withdrawing
troops from Cambodia (and Laos), as a <i>sine qua non</i> for normalizing
relations with its enemies and ending its international isolation. I was
in Paris in 1991 studying French as the end of the Cold War and the
disappearance of the Soviet Union opened the way for the signing of
peace accords closing what is now commonly referred to as the “Third
Indochina War”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>
<br><br>
But the war carried on in the academic field, much as it had in
Europe after World War I.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> Orthodox vs revisionist writers and scholars
continued to do battle in editorials, books, conferences, films, novels,
documentaries, and organizations. While I was not a member of the
“Vietnam Generation” or the Pro- or Anti-war Movements (I was
born in June 1965), I was keenly aware of the minefield into which I
was stepping as I began my study of twentieth-century Vietnam and set <b>(p.3)</b>
off for Hanoi in 1988.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> I certainly knew that the “Indochina idea” was
a taboo subject inside and outside Vietnam. On one side, writers used
the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and Hanoi’s massive military
presence in Laos as proof of communist Vietnam’s expansionist designs
of a hegemonic, Indochinese kind. This only confirmed the validity of
the American intervention against communism. On the other side were
those, opposed to American involvement in the war, who argued just
as passionately that Hanoi was the victim of continued and unjustified
threats to its national security. Not only was the SRV ’s intervention in
Cambodia entirely justified given that Hanoi ended Pol Pot’s murderous
regime but also Laos and Cambodia were vital to Hanoi’s continued
defence against foreign aggression.
<br><br>
The last thing I wanted to do as a young scholar trying to catch an
academic break was to walk into such a minefield speaking of Vietnamese
nationalists and communists in Indochinese terms. So what happened?
Two important things occurred simultaneously and entirely by accident.
Both were intertwined. First, as I started studying French in Paris in 1991
while working as a <i>garçon au père</i>, I spent my weekends and time-off
perusing dusty old colonial papers held in the old <i>Bibliothèque nationale</i>
on rue Richelieu and its annex then located in Versailles. I had not yet
begun my PhD, but I knew I wanted to do something on the first half
of the twentieth century. In those days, one could easily order, consult,
and even photocopy the originals of newspapers at a reasonable price.
Completely by chance, I decided to order one called <i>France-Indochine</i>.
I started with the year 1929 – it seemed like an important conjuncture
– and began thumbing through the pages. It was a good read and I was
content to be improving my French. The “Indochinese adventure” began
one day when a bundle of dusty old papers for the years 1930–31
landed on my table. I opened it and began skimming the pages as usual.
Within an hour or so, a series of articles written by the famous politician-scholar,
Pham Quynh, caught my eye. They had nothing to do with
Confucianism, literature, or Franco-Annamese cooperation. They dealt
instead with his recent travels to Laos and his thoughts on Vietnamese <b>(p.4)</b> 
immigration there. I read on until I encountered his lively debate with
another cultural giant of the time, Nguyen Van Vinh, over the reality of
Indochina.
<br><br>
All of this struck me as very strange since what I had read in the
existing scholarship had always focused on the cultural activities of
these two men and their collaborative relations with the French. This
was very different. Here they were debating whether the Vietnamese
could or should become “Indochinese”. Could French Indochina serve
as the final form of Vietnamese nationalism? These were their words,
not mine. Second, this was 1930–31, the colonial period, not the 1960s
or during the third Indochina War. “What’s going on here?”, I remember
asking myself. I kept on reading and, to my surprise, the debate widened
quickly as I ordered Nguyen Van Vinh’s paper, <i>L’Annam Nouveau</i>,
in order to read his replies to Pham Quynh. I found other nuggets on
these matters in Pham Quynh’s review, <i>Nam Phong</i> (Southern Wind).
Soon I was moving from one paper to another until I had under my eyes
Laotian Prince Phetsarath’s feisty reply to both of these Vietnamese
luminaries. As I kept digging, I began to unearth a wider vein of debates
about immigration, federalism, Vietnam, Annam, and the reality of
Indochina. The articles even provided clues for locating earlier debates,
including the <i>Courrier saïgonnais</i>’ rejection of Ho Chi Minh’s confusion
of “Annam” with “Indochina” after World War I. Within five or six
weekends of enthusiastic reading, it was clear that some of the most
important Vietnamese elites of the interwar period were thinking about
Indochina in ways I had never imagined possible. It also dawned on me
that the press served as the forum (and thus the archive for me) for the
colonized at odds over the space in which they were living at the time.
<br><br>
Going through all of this, I couldn’t help but notice that there was a
real gap in communist Vietnam’s and the Vietnam War generations’ discourse
and scholarship on the Indochinese idea. Most importantly, in all
the politically motivated debates over “Indochina” since the start of the
wars in 1945, no one had taken a close look at what exactly had been happening
among the “Indochinese” during the colonial period. Clearly, the
pre-1945 period had had some sort of an impact on those living within
it at the time and that this must have influenced later actions, policies,
thinking, and events. If not, then why would so many Vietnamese even
be asking themselves whether they were “Indochinese”, “Annamese”, <b>(p.5)</b> 
“Vietnamese”, or indeed something else? It struck me that “colonialism”
on the one hand and “nationalism” and “communism” on the other were
not operating in a binary opposition. I began to think about how the two
sides interacted. But for the time being, I kept my head low, content just
to keep on reading, improving my French, and above all making photocopies.
I was soon a regular customer not only at the <i>BnF</i>, but also at the
colonial archives in Aix-en-Provence and the military ones in Vincennes.
I delved into colonial literature, paged through colonial school textbooks
for Indochina, and picked up colonial geography books and maps. I also
began to order communist papers to see whether the Left and Far Left
intellectuals and politicians were talking about such things. They were.
<br><br>
This digging coincided fortuitously with the re-edition in 1991 of
Benedict Anderson’s now classic study <i>Imagined Nations: Reflections
on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> A specialist of Indonesia and
Southeast Asia, as well as one of the world’s leading theorists of nationalism,
Anderson provided me with a framework from which I could build
my analysis of the Indochinese idea. Having a mass of virgin sources
was one thing; knowing what to do with them analytically was quite
another. Anderson introduced me to an exciting theoretical take on
nationalism, using Southeast Asian examples with which I was most
familiar, all the while opening my mind to wider comparisons across
the globe. Moreover, crucial to Anderson’s argument about the spread
of nationalism was the importance of taking colonial connections seriously.
This could not have come at a better time for me. And of course
for those who have read his book, you already know that he was the first
to ask why the Javanese could declare an independent Republic of all
of Indonesia in 1945, whereas their Vietnamese counterparts balked
at setting up an Indochinese Republic in favour of a Vietnamese one.
Focusing on the spread of print culture and the impact of colonial education,
among other things, Anderson argued that many Vietnamese did
indeed think of themselves as Indochinese. He was the first to speak of
the “growth of an ‘Indochinese’ consciousness’”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a>
<br><br>
Anderson got me and others thinking in new ways. Indeed, as I learned
just before <i>VIC</i> went to press in 1995, his comparison of Indochina and <b>(p.6)</b> 
Indonesia had sent another scholar down a parallel path to mine. His
name is David Henley and he wrote an excellent theoretical comparison
of the “Indonesian/Javanese” and “Indochinese/Vietnamese” ideas,
which has become a classic in the field.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Anderson also set off a proliferation
of path-breaking studies on Southeast Asian nationalism and
state-formation, all of which have deeply influenced me. I’m thinking,
among others, of Thonchai Winichakul’s <i>Siam Mapped</i>, Søren Ivarsson’s
<i>Creating Laos</i>, Penny Edwards’ <i>Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation</i>,
and Eric Jennings’ <i>Vichy in the Tropics</i> (though Anderson is less present
in Jennings’ analysis than in the others).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>
<br><br>
While I may differ with Anderson on Cambodia and Laos “going Indochinese”
(see chapter 4), I owe much to him and his work. In fact, in 1994,
during a conference organized by Hans Antlöv and Stein Tønnesson in
Copenhagen on “Asian forms of the nation”,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> Anderson urged me to keep
on going (as did Tønnesson and Antlöv). Meanwhile, at the Université de
Paris VII , where I had enrolled in a pre-PhD program, my advisors, Pierre
Brocheux and Daniel Hémery, both counselled me to forget about the politics
of the present and focus on the interconnections occurring during the
colonial period. My work under Hémery and Brocheux coincided with the
shift in their own work towards understanding the “ambiguous” yet important
connections occurring in Indochina during the colonial period.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a>
<br><br>
There is one last person whom I feel I must mention in the genesis of
this book. That is the late Deny Lombard. Thanks to his seminar at the <b>(p.7)</b>
<i>Ecole des Hautes études en Sciences sociales</i> and his Braudelian approach,
I began to think about the material things on the ground, and not just
the ideas in peoples’ heads, that allowed so many Vietnamese to think of
themselves in wider, Indochinese terms. Lombard’s <i>Carrefour javanais</i>
and Braudel’s classic study of the Mediterranean got me thinking about
the importance of networks, roads, and people moving along them,
essential to the making of space. I have always kept in mind Braudel’s
famous line about “his” space, the Mediterranean, when thinking about
“mine”: “La Méditerranée n’a d’unité que par le mouvement des hommes,
les liaisons qu’il implique, les routes qui le conduisent”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> I applied
this methodological approach to my study of Indochina as well as to my
subsequent work on the Asian context of war and revolution.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
<br><br>
This, then, is the wider context in which <i>VIC</i> and the resulting
book here took form. What strikes me most as I revise the manuscript
for publication is the degree to which this book really is the product of
pure chance. Had I not discovered Pham Quynh’s essays in the pages of
<i>France-Indochine</i> in 1991 in the National Library in Paris, I honestly do
not think that the essay published in 1995 or this book would have come
to fruition. The same would be true if Anderson, Tønnesson, Antlöv,
and Lombard had not got me thinking in new ways.
<br><br>
Since publishing <i>VIC</i> almost two decades ago, I have continued
to test my original argument – that the colonial period counts, that
Vietnamese of a wide range of political colors did, in fact, think of themselves
in Indochinese terms, and that many of them came remarkably
close to “going Indochinese” not just in their heads but also because of
the material connections pushing them on the ground. In my subsequent
and separate research projects, I have kept my eyes open for all
Indochinese things for further information supporting or disapproving <b>(p.8)</b>
my argument. And here I did indeed find something that led me to revise
my thinking significantly. It was another debate over the concept of
Indochina, but this time it occurred between the Vietnamese and the
Cambodians. It began in the wake of the Pham Quynh–Nguyen Van
Vinh debate in 1931, reached a crescendo in 1934–35, and continued
to surface in the press until Vichy took over in Indochina during World
War II . Whereas Pham Quynh and Nguyen Van Vinh’s exchange demonstrated
the extent to which Vietnamese could think of themselves in
Indochinese terms, the second debate demonstrated the remarkable degree
to which Cambodian and Laotian elites wanted nothing to do with
“Indochina”, whether it were French or Vietnamese in design. Laotian
and Cambodian nationalists saw Indochina as an exclusive Franco-
Vietnamese club and as a threat to their efforts to predicate national
identity along Cambodian and Laotian territorial lines.
<br><br>
What I call the “great” Vietnamese-Cambodian debate of the mid-
1930s convinced me that there was more to the Indochina story than
simply analyzing the new spatial concept of Indochina along strictly
Franco-Vietnamese lines. Of equal importance were the Cambodians
and Laotians and the question of <i>place</i>, in particular the modern colonial
categories and legally delineated notions of “citizenship” and “nationality”.
For reasons I discuss below, Cambodians and Laotians were increasingly
opposed to the Indochinese idea on the grounds that it would
transform them into “Indochinese citizens” and that this would be a
very bad thing. Given the preponderant place the Vietnamese would
hold in such a territorially defined Indochinese colonial federation or
postcolonial nation, Cambodians and Laotians feared that such a legally
defined citizenship would allow the Vietnamese to step up their already
robust immigration into Laos and Cambodia.
<br><br>
This also got me thinking that, if much has been written over the
years in colonial studies about the need to rethink colonial categories
between the colonized and the colonizer, this second debate made it
clear that we also need to consider how such colonially constituted categories
impacted upon relationships <i>among</i> the colonized themselves.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>
<br><br>
<b>(p.9)</b>
<br><br>
As Roger Brubaker demonstrated for the new nation-states of France
and Germany in the late nineteenth century, national space (territory)
and place (citizenship) went hand in hand. Similar things can be said for
colonial states. Not only did the French carve out a territorially defined
Indochinese space but also they had to define who belonged to that
scientifically delimited space in legal terms. Place therefore refers above
all to concepts of colonial “citizenship” and “nationality”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> I have thus
added a chapter below on these matters, based in part on an article I
published in <i>Modern Asian Studies</i> in 2009. Chapter 4 adds nuances and
greater depth to my analysis and provides another analytical dimension,
helping us to better understand why the colonial concept of Indochina
failed to take root in Laotian and Cambodian national minds.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>
<br><br>
These revisions also explain why the title now reads: <i>Going Indochinese:
Contesting Concepts of Space and Place in Colonial French Indochina</i>.
Arguably, Going Indochinese should be followed by a question mark as
this would capture the original idea that there was nothing necessarily
inevitable about “Vietnam” or artificial about becoming “Indochinese”
at the time. (Here, however, I bowed to the wishes of the publisher.) As
in the original version, the <i>contested</i> nature of <i>space</i> remains the same,
but what I have added here is the matter of <i>place</i> – the legal categories
mentioned above. Why <i>French Indochina</i> instead of <i>Vietnamese nationalism</i>
as in the original title? For the reason noted above that subsequent
research and reflection have convinced me that one cannot exclude
Laotian and Cambodians voices – or even French ones for that matter.
I try to bring them into the picture, for they were central to rolling
back the Indochinese idea. And it is clear that the Franco-Vietnamese
attempts to create Indochina played a central role in stimulating modern
nationalism in Cambodia and Laos. <i>French Indochina</i> thus serves as my
shorthand for referring to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, as well as to the
colonizer, France. These are the four main players in my story.
<br><br>
<b>(p.10)</b> Before moving on, I should say a bit more about our use of the terms
“Annam” and “Vietnam”. For many of the political and historiographical
reasons evoked above, present convention normally holds that “Vietnam”
is preferable to “Annam”, for it captures “true” Vietnamese nationalist
sentiments, whereas “Annam” is usually considered pejorative. I accept
this explanation, but only partially. There is no doubt that the third syllable
of the French word “An-na-mite” could sting painfully in colonial
encounters of an unfortunate kind, just as the two Chinese characters,
“An-Nam” (Land of the Pacified South), could convey a humiliating
sense of submission. The problem, however, is that prior to 1945 many
Vietnamese nationalists actually used, and sometimes even preferred, the
word “Annam” and “Annamese” in their patriotic writings. I am thinking
of the famous poet and editor of the <i>Annamese Review</i> (<i>An Nam Tap Chi</i>),
Tan Da; the president of the fiercely anticolonial Vietnamese Nationalist
Party (<i>Viet-Nam Quoc Dan Dang</i>), Nguyen Khac Nhu; as well as Ho Chi
Minh and Nguyen An Ninh to name but a few.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> Moreover, as late as 1945,
there was nothing preordained about the word or concept of “Vietnam”.
In the years (indeed months) leading up to the August Revolution, some
nationalists still wanted to see “Dai-Nam” or “Dai-Viet” resurrected,
while others countered with “An-Nam”, “Nam”, or “Indo-China”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> As
Hoang Xuan Han, a former cabinet minister in the short-lived Tran
Trong Kim government of mid-1945, told me in the early 1990s: “had
the French created Indochina twenty years earlier, we might well have <b>(p.11)</b>
declared an Indochinese state in 1945”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> All of these patriots were obviously
not French “collaborators”; so it seems that the word “Annam” (and
“Indochina”) did not always embody pejorative connotations, nor was it
necessarily “pro-colonial” or “anti-Vietnamese” at certain points in time.
<br><br>
Thus, instead of discarding outright the term “Annam” on anticolonialist,
nationalist, or stylistic grounds, I feel it is crucial to hold
on to “Annam” as a way of locating breaks in the nationalist discourse,
behind which competing ideas, such as “Viet-Nam” and “Indo-China”,
started contesting its hegemony (and Annam never exercised a semantic
monopoly).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> I will thus take up the word “Annam” in my text on the
grounds that this term acknowledged the existence of a geo-political
entity both for the French and the Annamese during the colonial period
and for the simple yet important reason that a wide-range of Annamese
nationalists used it themselves <i>at the time</i>. This will allow me to track their
use of certain terms and to understand why, especially when writing in
<i>quoc ngu</i> (romanized script), they jumped suddenly from “Annam” to “Dai
Viet”, “Nam Viet”, “Nha Nam”, “Nuoc Nam”, “Nam”, and especially “Viet-
Nam” and “Dong Duong” (<i>Indochina</i>), and then slid back to “Annam” as
if nothing had truly happened. I will switch to the word, “Vietnam”, in
chapter 3 for the period from 1930, when this coupling – sometimes but
not always – started to take on a powerful life in the minds and mouths of
an expanding nationalist elite, communist and non-communist alike.
<br><br>
When I need to make an ethnic distinction, I will use the word
“Viet” instead of the inclusive terms “Vietnamese”, “Annamese”, or
“Indochinese”. For similar reasons, I will also refer to the inhabitants of
western Indochina as the “Cambodians” and the “Laotians” and use the
terms “Khmer” and “Lao”, respectively, to distinguish the specific ethnic
group. This admittedly oversimplifies a number of things, not least of all
notions of ethnicity, and leaves the ethnic minority groups located in the
highlands of French Indochina out of the picture (despite the fact that in
Laos they constituted the majority of the population). My use of “Laos”
here also assumes that such a unitary state had already existed under the <b>(p.12)</b>
French, which was not the case until the mid 1940s. I can only plead
guilty, recommending that readers consult the excellent studies of Oscar
Salemink and Søren Ivarsson, who address such matters expertly.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>
<br><br>
But let us agree on one thing as I turn to the subject at hand here.
Rather than assuming the Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia we see on
the map today have always existed, let us go back in time and space
to try to understand how colonial policies interacted with and transformed
pre-existing notions of the geo-political landscape among
the “Indochinese”.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> Whether communist or non-communist, all the
Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian nationalists under study here
agreed on the reality of a national “body” (<i>un seul corps</i>) – to borrow one
famous Annamese patriot’s precise term<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> –, but they had great trouble
choosing the geographical patterns of this entity and deciding on who
would and would not be a part of it. We might know “the” answer today,
in 2012; but all sorts of possibilities existed at the time, when much was
in flux in French Indochina. Let us thus start at the beginning of the
colonial period and move forward rather than forcing the past to fit the
post 1945, war driven debates of the present.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>
