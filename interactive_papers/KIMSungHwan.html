			case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<b>Wystan Hugh Auden</b> (1907 - 1973), generally known as W. H. Auden, was the leading literary figure in poetry, screenplay, and general literature in the twentieth century.[1] He was born in York, England, and graduated from the Christ Church of Oxford University in 1928. Although his first collection of poems was published in the same year, it was not until two years later that he became prominent with another collection, which was published with the help of T. S. Elliot.[2] In 1935, he married Erika Mann simply to let her escape from Nazi Germany.[3] He went to Spain in 1937 to write on the Spanish civil war, and by 1939 he moved to the United States, met his lover Chester Kallman, and became a U.S. citizen in 1946.[4] Auden was heavily criticised in England for running away to America on the eve of WWII.[5] Nevertheless, he continued to write hugely influential literary pieces, including <i>The Age of Anxiety</i>, which was published in 1947 and won him the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1948.[6] He was the professor of poetry at Oxford University from 1956 to 1961, but was only required to give three lectures per year, which allowed him to largely stay outside England. His declining health, however, eventually made him move back to Oxford in 1972 but spent his final days in Austria. He died of heart failure in Vienna, Austria.[7] He was the Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1954 until his death.[8]<br>References<br><br><sup>1</sup> “WH Auden (1907 - 1973),” <i>BBC History</i>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/auden_wh.shtml"> http://www.bbc.co.history/historic_figures/auden_wh.shtml</a>(accessed on May 10, 2014).<br><br><sup>2</sup> “W.H.

It will come because the conditions of suzerainty which Japan must impose on China will prove humanly intolerable and will shortly provoke an effort of resistance that will astound the world.’ Snow was right about the outcome of Japanese imperialism, though not about the military effectiveness of Chinese resistance.” (414, from Snow, <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> [June 1936])'); break;

	<p><b>1st September 1939</b><br>
by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Wystan Hugh Auden</a>

<p>
I sit in one of the dives<br>
On Fifty-second Street<br>
Uncertain and afraid<br>
As the clever hopes expire<br>
Of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">a low dishonest decade</a>: <br>
Waves of anger and fear<br>
Circulate over the bright<br>
And darkened lands of the earth,<br>
Obsessing our private lives;<br>
The unmentionable odor of death<br>
Offends the September night.<br>
</p>

<p>
Accurate scholarship can<br>
Unearth the whole offense<br>
From Luther until now<br>
That has driven a culture mad,<br>
Find what occurred at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[Linz]</a>,<br>
What huge <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[imago]</a> made<br>
A psychopathic god:<br>
I and the public know<br>
What all schoolchildren learn,<br>
Those to whom evil is done<br>
Do evil in return.<br>
</p>

<p>
Exiled Thucydides knew<br>
All that a speech can say<br>
About Democracy,<br>
And what dictators do,<br>
The elderly rubbish they talk<br>
To an apathetic grave;<br>
Analyzed all in his book,<br>
The enlightenment driven away,<br>
The habit-forming pain,<br>
Mismanagement and grief:<br>
We must suffer them all again.<br>
</p>

<p>
Into this neutral air<br>
Where blind skyscrapers use<br>
Their full height to proclaim<br>
The strength of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[Collective Man]</a>,<br>
Each language pours its vain<br>
Competitive excuse:<br>
But who can live for long<br>
In an euphoric dream;<br>
Out of the mirror they stare,<br>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[Imperialism]</a>'s face<br>
And the international wrong.<br>
</p>

<p>
Faces along the bar<br>
Cling to their average day:<br>
The lights must never go out,<br>
The music must always play,<br>
All the conventions conspire<br>
To make this fort assume<br>
The furniture of home;<br>
Lest we should see where we are,<br>
Lost in a haunted wood,<br>
Children afraid of the night<br>
Who have never been happy or good.<br>
</p>

<p>
The windiest militant trash<br>
Important Persons shout<br>
Is not so crude as our wish:<br>
What mad Nijinsky wrote<br>
About Diaghilev<br>
Is true of the normal heart;<br>
For the error bred in the bone<br>
Of each woman and each man<br>
Craves what it cannot have,<br>
Not universal love<br>
But to be loved alone.<br>
</p>

<p>
From the conservative dark<br>
Into the ethical life<br>
The dense commuters come,<br>
Repeating their morning vow;<br>
“I <i>will</i> be true to the wife,<br>
I'll concentrate more on my work,”<br>
And helpless governors wake<br>
To resume their compulsory game:<br>
Who can release them now,<br>
Who can reach the deaf,<br>
Who can speak for the dumb?<br>
</p>

<p>
Defenseless under the night<br>
Our world in stupor lies;<br>
Yet, dotted everywhere,<br>
Ironic points of light<br>
Flash out wherever the Just<br>
Exchange their messages:<br>
May I, composed like them<br>
Of Eros and of dust,<br>
Beleaguered by the same<br>
Negation and despair,<br>
Show an affirming flame.<br>
</p>
