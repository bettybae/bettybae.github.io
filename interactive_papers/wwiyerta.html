<center>SIX WOMEN AND THE INVASION
BY
GABRIELLE & MARGUERITE YERTA
WITH PREFACE BY
MRS. HUMPHRY WARD
MACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED
ST. MARTIN’S STREET, LONDON
1917</center>
<br><br>
<b>[v]</b>
<br><br>
<center>PREFACE</center>
<br><br>
This little book gives a very graphic and interesting account by an eye-witness—who knows
how to write!—of life in the occupied provinces of France under the daily pressure of the
German invasion. There are many repulsive and odious incidents recorded here of the
German occupation, but, mercifully, few “atrocities,” such as those which make of the
French Governmental Reports, or that of the Bryce Commission, tales of horror and infamy
that time will never wash out. These pages relate to the neighbourhood of Laon, and the
worst brutalities committed by German soldiers in France seem to have happened farther
south, along the line of the German retreat during the battle of the Marne, and in the border
villages of Lorraine. But the picture drawn of the Germans in possession of a French country
district, robbing and bullying its inhabitants, and delighting in all the petty tyrannies of their
military régime, is one that writes in large-hand the lesson of this war.<b>[vi]</b> “There must be no
next time!” If Europe cannot protect itself in future against such conduct on the part of a
European nation, civilisation is doomed.
<br><br>
And that this little book under-states the case rather than over-states it, can be proved by a
mass of contemporary evidence. I pass for instance from Madame Yerta’s graphic account of
the endless “requisitions,” “perquisitions,” “inquisitions,” to which the inhabitants of Morny
in the Laonnois were subject in 1915, to a paragraph in this week’s Morning Post (Tuesday,
September 18), where a letter found upon a German soldier, and written to a comrade in
Flanders from this very district, gleefully says: “We take from the French population all their
lead, tin, copper, cork, oil, candlesticks, kitchen pots, or anything at all like that, which is
sent off to Germany. I had a good haul the other day with one of my comrades. In one
walled-up room we found fifteen copper musical instruments, a new bicycle, 150 pairs of
sheets, some towels, and six candlesticks of beaten copper. You can imagine the kind of
noise the old hag made who owned them. I just laughed. The Commandant was very
pleased.”
<br><br>
No doubt the Commandant was of the same race as the Von Bernhausens or the
Bubenpechs,<b>[vii]</b> whom Madame Yerta pillories in these lively and sarcastic pages. It would
be too much indeed to expect that any Frenchwoman who had passed through fifteen months
of such a life should write with complete impartiality of her temporary masters. She would
be less than human were it possible. Yet in the sketches of the two German officers “Barbu”
and “Crafleux,” billeted on the “six women,” there is no more than a laughing malice, and an
evident intention to be fair to men who had no evident intention to be cruel. But of the
bullying Commandant, Lieutenant von Bernhausen, and of the officer, Lieutenant Bubenpech,
who succeeded him as the absolute master of the French village which is the scene of the
book, Madame Yerta gives us portraits in which every touch bites. The drunken, sensual
manners of such men, combined with German conceit and German arrogance, make up a
type of character only too real, only too common, to which throughout the districts where the
Germans have passed, French experience bears inexorable and damning witness.
It is clear, however, that these six brave women—Madame Valaine, her four daughters and
her daughter-in-law, the writer of the book—were well able to take care of themselves. The
tale of their courage, their gaiety, their resource under<b>[viii]</b> the endless difficulties and petty
oppressions of their lot, lights up the miserable scene, kindling in the reader the same longing
for retribution and justice on a barbarian race, as burnt in their French hearts.
Madame Yerta describes for us how neighbours helped each other, how they met in the farm
kitchens, behind their closed doors and windows, to pass on such news as they could get, to
pray for France, and scoff at the invader; how they ingeniously hid their most treasured
possessions, how they went hungry and cold because the Germans had robbed them of food,
clothing and blankets—(they are doing it afresh at this very moment in occupied France and
Belgium!)—and how village and town alike would have starved but for the
Spanish-American Relief Commission.
<br><br>
The result is a typically French book, both in its lightness of touch and in the passionate
feeling that breaks through its pages. The old Latin civilisation makes the background of
it—with its deeply rooted traditions, its gifts of laughter and of scorn, its sense of manners
and measure, its humanity, its indomitable spirit. When the writer at last, after fifteen months
of bondage, sees once more the fields of “la douce France,” she puts simply and sharply into
words<b>[ix]</b> the thoughts and sufferings of thousands—thousands of ill-treated, innocent and
oppressed folk—to whom, as we pray, the course of this just war will before long bring
comfort and release.
<br><br>
Her book deserves a wide audience, and will, I hope, find it.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<center>CHAPTER V</center>
<br><br>
We were at home again! This was a set-off for the misfortunes with which a wretched fate
had loaded us. The house was as snug as we had left it, and we had but to return to our old
habits. So we did and exactly! The cake we had left, at our flight, was still lying on the table.
As we were hungry we each snatched our share, and ate it with ravenous appetite. It was a bit
hard, but all the same delicious. We wandered through the house with joy. We were at home
again! How many of those who had fled from the invasion had renounced the pleasures of
home for months or even years? Some of out friends at Morny had not yet come back. Yet
could we pity them? A thousand times no; at least they would never endure the trials to
which the conquered are exposed, and which, after a momentary calm, once more had
depressed us. The presence of the Germans, quartered in the village, seemed unbearable.<b>[98]</b>
<br><br>
Ah, poor, poor snails that we were! In spite of our efforts, the flood had overtaken and
submerged us. The tree we tried to climb was too low; the inundation covered everything;
and we could not foresee the end of the nightmare. How long should we have to groan and
struggle in that all-devouring water? We besought God to deliver us, and God seemed deaf to
our prayers and blind to our tears. We called to you who were on the mainland over the
mountains, insurmountable as the great wall of China. Our hearts called to you, and no one
answered. For a fortnight the floods had been out, and already we were losing patience.
<br><br>
Morally drowned as we were, we still had a physical need of food. A household of seven
persons and two dogs must furnish its larder and cellar with abundant provisions. The
grocers of the village had but empty shops; our neighbours were unhumbled, because each
was the owner of a plot of ground. Less favoured than the poorest of the poor, we had no
crop at all. What would become of us? I have said we had no crop. I was wrong. We even
had a superb crop. The pear trees, even those which these last fifteen years had yielded no
fruit at all, had deemed it a point of honour to do their best, in hard times, and were all laden
with huge plump pears,<b>[99]</b> which made your mouth water. They were not ripe yet; but,
determined not to tempt the green-uniformed marauders, we made up our minds to gather
them. For two days we picked them, and filled basket upon basket with pears, long or round,
green or yellow.
<br><br>
Then there was the problem to solve, where to hide them? We laid our heads together, and by
unanimous consent decided upon the deserter’s attic. On one side, the attic was full of
faggots; on the other, behind the chimney that comes up from the wash-house, there was a
floor-space, about eight feet square, and there we laid our beautiful pears amid shreds of
paper instead of straw. To conceal their retreat, we heaped up at the entrance old boxes,
hen-coops, and a garden roller in elaborate disorder. Nobody would ever have thought that
this innocent pile of rubbish was a treasure-hoard. But we, who knew, put one foot here,
another there, and at a bound we were on the floor in the very abode of the pears, where
cunning paths allowed us to visit our friends and choose the juiciest among them. We never
made these visits without a groan, for we always forgot the existence of a big cistern, fitted
up in the roof, and constantly knocked our heads against this iron ceiling. But the shock itself
kindled our imagination, and struck out a flash of genius.<b>[100]</b>
<br><br>
“Suppose we put the wine into the cistern!”
<br><br>
We thought we had given all our wine to the French soldiers, and then we discovered in the
bottom of a box about thirty bottles, which we resolved to hide from the Germans’ thirst. I
must admit that our sobriety equals the camel’s. We drink hardly anything besides water. A
bottle of wine a week satisfies the needs of the whole family. But, all the same, we did not
want our wine to moisten German throats. So through the yard, up the ladder, over the boxes,
the bottles went their way. Not too well poised on a tottering scaffolding I wriggled into the
narrow space between the beam and the cistern. I held out a groping hand, into which was
placed the neck of a bottle, and little by little the receptacle was filled. We went quickly to
work. My sister-in-law carried up the bottles with care; I laid them down with a gentle hand.
For it is well known that a Prussian ear detects the clinking of bottles a mile off, and of
course the Prussian, contiguous to the ear, being forewarned, rests not until he has secured
the too imprudent bottles. But all of a sudden I was aroused by a loud shout, instantly hushed
to a discreet silence.
<br><br>
I jumped down from my scaffold, leapt over the pears, scaled the boxes, tumbled down the
ladder, and found myself in the midst of a perplexed group.<b>[101]</b>
<br><br>
“Grandmother, what is the matter?”
<br><br>
Yvonne and Colette, prying in the cellar, had discovered a fair-sized keg, which gurgled
when it was shaken.
<br><br>
The treasure-hunters thrust in the bung with an effort, inserted a tap, drew out a glass of the
liquor and brought it to me.
<br><br>
“What is it?”
<br><br>
Unctuous, yellowish substance. Was it oil, or syrup? I looked at it, shook the glass, smelt it,
even tasted a drop with the tip of my tongue, and then announced:
<br><br>
“It is glucose.”
<br><br>
Glucose! glucose! and we had no sugar left! Every morning we drank milk and coffee
unsweetened by honey. Mme. Valaine declared my diagnosis right, and we leapt for joy like
marionettes.
<br><br>
There was no more meat, no butter, and eggs were uncommonly rare, but sweetened dishes
take the place of everything. Baskets full of pears! A keg of glucose! Thirty bottles of wine!
Who talked of dearth? For truth’s sake I must say glucose did not answer as well as we
expected. When I tried to sweeten the milk with it, the milk turned sour, and with it the
experiment turned also, to my shame.
<br><br>
On the other hand, by stewing the beloved<b>[102]</b> pears with glucose and wine, I obtained an
unforgettable dish, over which a jury of cooks greedily licked its lips. And every other
evening, for two months, our scanty menu was thus composed: soup, stewed pears, bread at
discretion, fresh water at will. The glucose went to keep the wine company in the cistern,
except for a few bottles of either liquid, which we craftily concealed in the garden, and in
case of need we had but to cry out:
<br><br>
“Pierrot, go and fetch the bottle that is in the reeds or in the blue fir ... or in the big yew....”
<br><br>
It was much more amusing than simply to go down into the cellar.
<br><br>
Thus our life was not uninteresting, but our chief occupation was to watch the horizon, east
and south, where our soldiers were fighting. The guns were coming sensibly nearer; we
heard them growl day and night, and when it grew dark we saw shells burst above the hills.
We spent many hours in the garden looking out for these illuminations, hoping we might
understand something from the way they went. Then came the gleam of an explosive,
striping the sky with a flash of lightning or with a slow trail of light. The better to observe,
we got up the ladder, and sat on the wall. To the casual passer-by we might have resembled a
flock of crows at roost waiting for<b>[103]</b> gossip’s tales. Mme. Valaine had no taste for these
perilous exercises, and contented herself with the stories we told her. For us the only
spectacle we thought worth while was that very one which almost rent our hearts. How
eagerly we wished for the shells to burst nearer, nearer, to set the house in a blaze so that we
might be set free from our chains!
<br><br>
About the 25th of September took place the first shock between us and the German army. It
was nearly eight o’clock in the evening. The supper over, I went into the garden, and was
peering at the dark sky, heedless of the cold wind which caused my hair and my shawl to
flutter, when a frightful uproar broke the silence. Gruff voices cried out vociferously; heavy
boots kicked at the gates; the angry dogs barked till they choked.
<br><br>
“Good Heavens! what is happening?”
<br><br>
I threw myself down the ladder, fled through the garden—those days were full of wild
races—got to the house, and saw Geneviève hasten forth, a key in her hand.
<br><br>
“They want us to open the gate,” she said, “and we must.”
<br><br>
Yvonne seized the dogs by the collar and dragged them in. The gate was hardly unlocked
when those without threw it open, and at the<b>[104]</b> same time overran the yard. They were
furious, and one of them shouted out in bad French:
<br><br>
“When the Germans knock at a door, it should be opened immediately.”
<br><br>
“You think so, do you, you Boche!”
<br><br>
On hearing us speak fluent German they softened, and looked at us in amazement.
<br><br>
They all had the same round faces, which the lantern of an under-officer lit up.
<br><br>
They wanted a lodging: barns, stables to shelter men and horses. All that was difficult to get!
<br><br>
“There is room but for one horse in the stable.”
<br><br>
“Well, that will do for two horses and two men.”
<br><br>
“And here is the wash-house.”
<br><br>
“Six men will sleep there.”
<br><br>
The others withdrew to look for a lodging somewhere else. The remainder, who seemed to be
harmless blockheads, were convoys. We heaved a deep sigh, but hardly had a mouthful of air
reached our lungs, when the yard was already swarming with a new mob. Standing on the
steps I engaged in parley with the Feldwebel.
<br><br>
“The house is chock-full, and eight soldiers are already lodged in the outhouses.”
<br><br>
He was young, big, and stout, and his hard-featured face was deeply scarred.<b>[105]</b>
<br><br>
Of course he did not allow himself to be prevailed upon.
<br><br>
“It is all the same to me,” he answered; “make room for me if you have none.”
<br><br>
He ordered me to open the coach-house, but when he saw it crammed up with all sorts of
things, he made a wry face.
<br><br>
“And up there?” he asked, pointing at the deserter’s attic.
<br><br>
Good Heavens! the pears! the wine! I was trembling with fear, and was at a loss how to
answer when the man altered his mind:
<br><br>
“I would rather have a bedroom to myself,” and so saying he opened Antoinette’s door.
<br><br>
“That will do,” said the person, and waving back the silently waiting soldiers he kept but two
of them with him. We began to remove a few things from the room, which Antoinette had
always kept for herself, and before the sergeant’s taunting eyes we carried away clothes,
books, and knick-knacks. The door we had left ajar was suddenly thrown open, and a little
coxcomb of an officer came in and cried out in a cheerful tone:
<br><br>
“Oh! oh! Two at a time!”
<br><br>
That was more than we could stand, and leaving blankets and coverlets we ran away.
<br><br>
At the corner of the house a brutal arm stopped me, and a soldier I hardly saw in the
night<b>[106]</b> muttered something I did not understand about money—five francs. I tried to
break loose from the man’s hold, and answered at random we were no shopkeepers and sold
nothing.
“If you are busy,” he said, “another lady would do.”
<br><br>

In the dim light of a glimmering window I caught sight of a Slavonic-featured, black-bearded,
sneaking-eyed face that belonged to one of the stable-dwellers—a perfect brute. He looked
so strange, his voice was so peculiar that I suddenly understood the meaning of his words.
Frightened, I shook my arm to get it free, set off running, and got so quickly out of sight he
might have believed I had been swallowed up by the night. I rushed into the house, banged
the door, turned the key in it, pushed the bolts, and even then I was not sure I was secure. I
wished for padlocks, bars, chains, to protect us against such creatures. We thought we would
never dare go to bed.
<br><br>
With Mme. Valaine I went through the house to test the wooden shutters. In the street the
carts of the convoy stood close to the house; here and there we saw a lantern glimmer. Lying
under the awnings the drivers tumbled and tossed, and from time to time uttered heavy
groans. Those carts reminded us of monstrous beasts, hunch-backed and mischievous,
which<b>[107]</b> squatted at our door to watch and threaten us. The yard was pitch dark, all
seemed to be in a sound sleep, but for the horses, which kicked and pawed the ground of the
narrow stable. The men were snoring; the dogs shut up in the lobby whined gently. We
talked in a low voice and went on tip-toe. In our own house we felt beset with dangers and
cares. Without taking off our clothes, we laid ourselves down, our eyes wide open, our ears
attentive to all outside sounds, our nerves on edge. So we waited for the break of day.
<br><br>
The Germans got up at the first glimmer of a misty sun, and we watched them through the
trellised shutters. They had cooked a potato soup, a grey and sticky stuff, to which they
added some brandy, and which they ate without conviction.
<br><br>
For hours together they peeled vegetables, hummed tunes, whistled, dawdled up and down;
but they never drew a drop of water from the pump, and they seemed wholly unacquainted
with the fact that a human being ought to wash. Then they began cleaning their arms most
carefully, and deluged them with petroleum and oil. Our amazement was the same which the
sight of wigwams or niggers’ cabins might have roused, seen for the first time. Their guns,
leaning<b>[108]</b> against the gate, confirmed this impression. Real savages’ arms, the bayonets
were about a hand’s breadth, and notched like a saw. At the mere thought of the wounds such
teeth would make in the flesh, an icy chill ran through our veins.
<br><br>
About nine, after half an hour’s monotonous shouting, the convoy filed off, and soon after
vanished from sight. As soon as they were gone we rushed out. The street swarmed with
people, like an ant-hill which a clumsy foot has trodden on. Well! well! German boots leave
traces. The High Street of Morny had never before witnessed such filth. On all sides lay dirty
straw, muddy rags, formless scraps of iron. The horse-dung looked clean compared with the
rest.
<br><br>
As to ourselves, we cried with horror at the sight of our poor yard, into which we could not
put our foot. Oily pools stood here and there; the pavement, bespattered with mud, was
covered all over with dirty rags, greasy papers, vegetable peelings, and, overtopping all the
rest, what Antoinette pompously called “human dejections.” And yet in a corner of the
garden was a closet formerly intended for the gardener.... But such people....
Disgusted and bewailing, old Tassin spent the whole afternoon in cleaning the yard, and
made more than one unpleasant discovery, such as<b>[109]</b> about 40 lb. of rotten meat
concealed in the straw. The “small room” was in a sorry plight. The pandours had emptied
the ink-pot into a work-table, scribbled the walls all over, broken a vase, taken away a
woollen blanket, an eider-down, and a door-curtain. As to the mattress and the
spring-mattress, we could not have touched them with a pair of tongs, covered as they were
with spots of grease. It is agreeable to receive Germans!
<br><br>
Antoinette instantly made up her mind to change her room, and easily transformed one of the
attics.
<br><br>
We went roundly to work, and the “small room” was soon as empty as a Pomeranian’s head.
We had made up our minds that the creatures should bring straw with them if they required
hospitality a second time. To the King of Prussia himself we would have grudged a bed, lest
he should leave it in as bad a condition as his men.
<br><br>
The convoy came back that very evening. Our guests of yesterday went back to their lodging.
Only the inhabitants of the “small room” did not return. Perhaps what was left them of
conscience reproached them with theft.
<br><br>
Early in the morning the carts went off, and after three hours’ work old Tassin declared he
had removed all traces of their second visit.<b>[110]</b> The whole village complained that the
rascals had not only dirtied whatever they approached, but had stolen what they wanted,
wasted provender and oats, and had thrown down whole sheaves of wheat for their horses to
lie on.
<br><br>
In the first weeks of the occupation the invaders bled the country to death. In Morny they
took thousands of fowls, hundreds of pigs and sheep, and I don’t know how many horses and
cows. M. Lantois’ black bull, which his ravishers had tethered to a cart, and then abandoned
in the middle of the road, protested in a wild, fierce, and fitful roar that he repeated every
other minute for hours together. The farmers dreaded marauders still more than official
requisitions. For what was requisitioned they obtained, if they insisted, a note of hand, often
scribbled in pencil and almost illegible, but at least proving they had been deprived of
something. The soldiers of course took an unfair advantage of their victims, who knew not
German, and cheated them in every way. We were often asked to translate such I.O.U.’s as
had been composed according to the writer’s own fancy. “Paid and carried away a horse,”
wrote one requisitioner who had but paid with lies.—”Exchanged two horses of equal
worth,” another pretended, when a broken-down hack had supplied<b>[111]</b> the place of a good
mare.—”Received 40 lb. of bacon.” And the honest customer knew he had gained 450 kilog.
on the pork-butcher.
<br><br>
In spite of all, the country people attached great importance to these notes of hand, and the
marauders gave them none. They went two or three together, got into the houses when the
people were working out in the fields, searched them from top to bottom, and laid hands on
what pleased them. They stripped the hen-houses and dovecots; they would drop in unawares
when the people were about to sit down to dinner, and then divert themselves by seizing and
feasting upon the dishes before the balked peasants’ very faces. Thus eaten out of house and
home, the village would soon be starved. The Mayor of Morny and M. Lonet resolved to go
to Laon and seek some protection against the raiders. The answer they got from the Germans
was that, first, rural matters were no concern of theirs, and secondly, that the people were
expected to give everything the soldiers asked for.
<br><br>
A word to the wise is enough.
<br><br>
Those who have not known the evils of invasion cannot imagine the rage and despair which
filled our hearts at being thus enslaved and ground down. Impotent wrath, overwhelming
despondency took hold of our souls, at once<b>[112]</b> humiliated and revolted. Like true civilised
people, we could not understand why we were forbidden to claim justice, to seek redress;
why we were expected to yield to brute strength. And there was no use to cry out for help, to
crave assistance. It seemed to us that we were forsaken by God and men.
But was the trap shut tight? Were we, for instance, whose interests, life, and dearest
affections lay on the other side of the front, without means to break through the enemy’s
barrier? Were we actually prisoners?
<br><br>
My mother-in-law made up her mind to go to Laon in order to consult competent judges. I
was to accompany her. This poor Laon, which I had seen but a few weeks ago bright with
French animation, in what state did we find it! We saw a few civilians only, with hard and
hostile faces. On the other hand there were a great many grey-clad Germans in the streets
with their helmets on, bustling about in the best of humour. They seemed at home
everywhere, and masters of all the houses. Most shops were shut up. I tried to get into the
only one I saw open, but nobody was in it. Only in the recesses of the back-shop a big hand
was busy about a saucepan, and heavy steps shook the spiral staircase. It is easy to
understand that I had had enough of<b>[113]</b> it, and that I hastened out with all possible speed.
The sight of their forsaken shops would have rent the hearts of the owners had they been
gifted with second sight. One of them, I suppose it was a grocer’s, had been smashed to
atoms. Glass jars, drawers, looking-glasses were but things of the past, and the floor was
covered all over with a litter twenty inches high, of biscuits, sweets, macaroni, rice, and odds
and ends of all kinds. We went to see the Mayor, and asked him the questions which we were
anxious to have answered. Were the Germans to settle in the country? Was it possible to go
to Paris? His answer was like a death-knell.
<br><br>
Nothing was to be done. The Germans were not likely to clear out. He deemed it folly to try
to go away. I left the room heart-broken.
<br><br>
We arrived in Morny just in time to see some German infantry march through the street.
They came from the front, and their ill-looks filled us with joy. They trudged along with
weary faces, and were all muddy, and bent as if with old age. “Just look at them,” we said.
“Where do they come from? Surely they are beaten men. Is the French army advancing?”
<br><br>
Colette, hidden behind the curtains, never failed to throw her wishes after the Germans as
they passed through the village.<b>[114]</b>
<br><br>
“Die, die, die. Die, you nasty red-haired fellow. Die, you fat brute. Die, you young
whipper-snapper. Oh, a wounded man! Die too, poor wretch; die, die, die”; and the litany
drew to a close only when the regiment had filed off.
<br><br>
“That is to help the French,” said she.
<br><br>
Many an adventure befell us in the month of October. I can merely refer, for instance, to a
certain officer who at eleven o’clock one night wished to lodge “twenty horses in our barn”;
or to four requisitioners who dragged us out of bed at five in the morning, and forced us to
dress in haste, merely to prove we had no pigs. These same soldiers delighted to talk German
with French women; tried to convince us that England was responsible for the war. “The
whole world is against us,” they said in a sulky voice; “the French, the English, the Russians,
the Belgians....”
<br><br>
“But you are so numerous.”
<br><br>
“Not so numerous as all that.”
<br><br>
I remember also that we were once awaked by two drunken soldiers, who insisted upon our
opening the window, and who at our refusal threatened and vociferated for an hour,
promising to come back and set fire to the house.
<br><br>
On the other hand, listen to the tragical, horrific history of one afternoon—it was a
washing<b>[115]</b> day; the charwoman had forgotten to close the gate. Two or three of us were in
the yard, when a sergeant and four men made their appearance. Horses were waiting in the
street. The sergeant was of lofty stature, stupid, grave, blue-eyed, and dark-bearded. He
asked us if we could furnish lodgings for “Herr Mayor and his ten men.” The honour was not
tempting. We pleaded want of room, we wrapped up our obvious ill-will in a mass of words.
Antoinette carelessly pointed at the “small room,” and hinted that we had no other left. The
men withdrew, the horses rode away, and we sang songs of victory.
<br><br>
But the following morning, about seven, I heard a noisy knock at the door. I hastened out,
and reluctantly admitted the visitors of yesterday. From the top of his head the sergeant
announced that “Herr Mayor was very cross, furious even, that we declined to receive him.”
He had sent the ruffians now to see how many rooms we might place at his disposal. I felt
sure anxious ears were listening behind every shutter in the house. The alarm had been given,
and the sluggards were making what speed they could. The fellows entered. The family
gathered together, scared and haggard. A few of them were dressed; the others were in
dressing-gowns. The Germans examined the rooms whose morning disorder<b>[116]</b> had been
hastily concealed, went up to the attic and down to the cellar. The sergeant then pronounced
judgment in a solemn voice. We might have offered five bedrooms to the German army.
<br><br>
Five bedrooms! And we had but five rooms, containing five beds! Where should we have
slept? On straw with the dogs! That was a happy thought!
<br><br>
“And you would have offered Herr Mayor that small room overlooking the yard! Herr
Mayor!”
<br><br>
As a matter of fact we had offered Herr Mayor nothing. But the poor wretch was as much
shocked as if we had proposed to lodge the Crown Prince in a pig-sty.
<br><br>
Well, then, to punish us and to teach us the respect due to German officers, we were
condemned to take into our house Herr Mayor and his ten men.
<br><br>
Death-like silence. A thunderbolt had fallen and struck us dumb. The soldier went on:
<br><br>
“Get dinner ready at half-past twelve—a table for one in the dining-room, for men in the
kitchen.”
<br><br>
At last we found our tongues.
<br><br>
“You talk of dinner! But we have no provisions to cook. Meat is not to be had at the
butcher’s....”<b>[117]</b>
<br><br>
“You will be provided with meat. We want wine—champagne.”
<br><br>
“Champagne!” We laughed in the face of the man.
<br><br>
“There is no wine in our cellar. We drink nothing but water.”
<br><br>
“Anyhow, mind you do things properly.”
<br><br>
This was said in a threatening voice, and we made no reply.
<br><br>
The sergeant had executed his mission, but he thought fit further to admonish us on his own
account.
<br><br>
“Are you aware that the Germans are unwilling invaders? They did not want to make war.
Who wished it? Can you doubt? It was England.”
<br><br>
“Was it? Oh, really!”
<br><br>
“And the civilians should be kind to the soldiers, who are very well-behaved. For instance,
we ourselves all come of distinguished families. A private soldier is not necessarily a
scoundrel.”
<br><br>
“I know that,” Geneviève answered. “My brother is a soldier. But as patriots yourselves, you
should understand that we are patriots too, and that it is painful for us to receive the enemy.”
<br><br>
“The enemy! The enemy!”
<br><br>
The sergeant, bounding with rage, struck the pavement with the butt-end of his gun.<b>[118]</b>
<br><br>
“No, we are not the enemies of women and children; we know how to behave ourselves....”
<br><br>
While he discoursed, one of the young men of “a distinguished family,” standing on the
staircase, caught sight of my husband’s shoes on a shelf. He seized a pair and put one shoe
into each pocket. Turning round he encountered Yvonne’s looks, and hastily replaced his
spoil. Twice, thinking himself unobserved, he recovered the shoes. But being too carefully
watched he gave it up as a bad job, and his superior officer concluded his speech in these
words:
<br><br>
“If the French went to Germany the civilians would receive them kindly.”
<br><br>
Indeed! I was pleased to hear it. But if the German women are ready to give a hearty
welcome to our soldiers—and that is quite easy to understand—it does not follow that we
ought to deal in like manner with their sons and husbands. We have never pretended to
govern ourselves by the fashion of Berlin!
<br><br>
At length they went away, and we had but to yield and prepare our saucepans. We would
rather have given a dinner-party to Gargantua and his family than prepare food for a German
officer and ten men just as German. We went to Mme. Tassin in our extremity. She would
surely come to our help, in spite of rheumatism. The<b>[119]</b> meat—about half an ox—was duly
brought; half of it was for soup, half to be roasted. In the wash-house, Mme. Tassin made a
gigantic soup, flavoured with a thousand vegetables. In the kitchen we peeled mountains of
potatoes, and prepared two bottles of French beans, which a soldier had brought in, stolen I
know not where. Antoinette, uncorking one of the bottles, broke its neck, and cut her finger.
Her blood poured upon the beans. Hurrying to help her I tore off a bit of my finger.
<br><br>
“Never mind! get on with the potatoes!”
<br><br>
At length the work was finished.
<br><br>
Huge and lean, wall-eyed and mouthed like a pike, Herr Mayor arrived with happy
nonchalance, and seated himself at the table. His attentive servant for very little would have
served him on his knees. Dinner done, Herr Mayor required tea, and, being presented with a
teapot, he demanded a liqueur, to flavour the tea. A few drops of rum were all that was left of
an old bottle which happened to be in the dining-room. I took it in. As distant as Sirius I
saluted the intruder. With a smile Herr Mayor made a low bow. Something like intelligence
lit up his pale eyes. He cleared his throat, and faltered out:
<br><br>
“The ladies ... would be ... safer in Paris ... than here....”<b>[120]</b>
<br><br>
I gave the rum-bottle to his servant, removed a hundred miles off, and answered:
<br><br>
“Certainly, sir.”
<br><br>
I withdrew.
<br><br>
In the kitchen the ten men seemed to be rather constrained; they talked in a low voice, but
did not lose their appetite for all that. My mother-in-law stood by, thinking that too many
things might have led them into temptation. At last they went away; Herr Mayor too. His
servant informed us that he would come alone to supper, and that he desired eggs and
pancakes. With slow steps the officer went down the street. Behind the buckler of our blinds
we burst out into bitter invectives:
<br><br>
“Be off, you old cut-throat! you old scout! You grind the weak; you bully women! You have
eaten my finger-tip and have drunk the blood of Antoinette! Cannibal! Man-eater!”
<br><br>
The cannibal came back in the evening, ate a small pâté, was pleased with the poached eggs,
and satisfied with the pancakes. Then he smoked his cigar at leisure, and all the while
remained unconscious of severe eyes watching him from the garden. Yvonne and Colette
made a wry face. “The sight of him is enough to make you sick. Fancy! I saw him put a
whole egg into his mouth! His glass was covered with grease when he drank. Ugh!”<b>[121]</b>
<br><br>
The next day after, another tune was played.
<br><br>
At twelve, precisely, Herr Mayor arrived, and calmly declared that, as his servant was out on
urgent business, we must have the kindness to wait upon him ourselves.
<br><br>
“A pretty request, truly!”
<br><br>
Mme. Tassin was nowhere. The omelette, done to a turn, was getting cold in the kitchen.
Meanwhile Herr Mayor was waiting in the dining-room. It was high time that the dish should
make the guest’s acquaintance. I made up my mind.
<br><br>
“I will take his dinner to the man.”
<br><br>
“Never! You wait at table!”
<br><br>
“And upon a Prussian!”
<br><br>
“He did it on purpose, of course.”
<br><br>
I persisted.
<br><br>
“I assure you I shall not deem myself degraded. And I promise you the man will feel uneasy
sooner than I.”
<br><br>
So beneath Herr Mayor’s haughty nose I put the omelette aux fines herbes.
<br><br>
To the same nose I presented the roast veal with boiled potatoes, which is dear to all German
hearts, and thought I might rest on my laurels. Then I saw that I had forgotten the sauce. Herr
Mayor was chewing dry veal, sunk in melancholy. I put the sauce-boat on the table within
reach of his hand.<b>[122]</b>
<br><br>
“I had forgotten this; I am not in the habit....”
<br><br>
What did I say? Herr Mayor looked uneasy. He nearly begged my pardon.... “Indeed, I am
afraid I disturb you....”
<br><br>
Ah! you deign to notice it? And you might as well have dined at the village inn? But you
don’t think that you and your ten gormandisers have reduced our stock of vegetables to
nothing, and swallowed up our last egg!
<br><br>
But you have not always an officer at hand to give you information, and so I thought I might
improve the occasion. “What is the cannon,” I asked, “which thunders day and night in the
south?”
<br><br>
“We have been fighting in Craonne for the last ten days,” said he; “the battle is said to be
coming to an end. Just before we were in Fismes.”
<br><br>
Herr Mayor pronounced Fismesse. In a doleful tone he bewailed the evils of war.
<br><br>
The regiment he belonged to had suffered forty per cent losses since the beginning of war.
He himself felt very ill. He had slept in the open air seven rainy nights running. Had I any
kinsman in the war?
<br><br>
“Of course, my husband; and I get no news at all from him. That is the worst of all
privations.”<b>[123]</b>
<br><br>
Herr Mayor nodded assent. These partings were cruel. Frau Mayor, too, would have given a
good deal to accompany her Mayor. As to ourselves, our situation might change for the
better. It was, for instance, to our interest that the Germans should advance. The front would
then be removed farther from us. I answered that we should welcome no such change for the
better. But suppose that just the reverse happened? If the Germans were driven back, the
front would also remove farther? Wouldn’t it?
<br><br>
“Oh! no, no.... Really, this war was stupid. England delights in making mischief, and the
French are mad to enter into an alliance with the English, when another country was so eager
to come to an agreement with them. France and Germany would get on well with each other.
What, then, prevents a thoroughly good understanding?”
<br><br>
“A mere nothing, sir; a grain of sand.... Alsace-Lorraine, sir.”
<br><br>
Herr Mayor shrugged his shoulders. He had forgotten Alsace-Lorraine.
<br><br>
His lunch was over. I asked if he intended to come and dine at our house.
<br><br>
Again he seemed at a loss what answer to give.<b>[124]</b>
<br><br>
“H’m, h’m ... I am not sure. I will let you know.”
<br><br>
His grey cloak streamed in the air, and Herr Mayor went away never to return.
<br><br>
Some days after I met him on the road. He bowed very low, and with a smiling face inquired
after my husband. The double-faced fellow knew only too well I had not heard from him, but
in common politeness I was fain to inquire also after his health. Herr Mayor was better,
much better. In a week he would be back at the front, and if he happened to hear from my
husband’s regiment, he promised to send me the news.
<br><br>
And with many a bow Herr Mayor smiled himself away. His face was not ever smiling. The
peasants were terrified at his way of carrying out requisitions. On the other hand, it was
rumoured that he believed himself sprang from the thigh of Jupiter—I beg your pardon—of
Wotan, and spoke to no one.
<br><br>
The family did not fail to exercise its flippancy at my expense. They asked for the recipe of
my philtres to charm Prussians; they urged me to write a treatise on the art of training
Germans, and prophesied a fine future for me as a tamer of tigers.
<br><br>
I did not mind being scoffed at. Too many cares claimed my attention. Besides, Barbu and
Crafleux had just appeared in our orbit.<b>[125]</b> But I am anticipating. Our chief anxiety was
commonplace enough. The food problem was hard to solve. Fortunately, in spite of direful
predictions, bread did not run short at the beginning of the war. Milk we had every day.
Though Mme. Lantoye had been robbed of several cows, and though children were provided
for first, she always gave us some. We had almost forgotten the taste of meat. Butter and
cheese, hard to discover, were extravagantly dear, and eggs were as scarce as in Paris at the
end of the siege. We had laid by a small provision of rice and macaroni, articles of food no
more to be found in the shops; but we had decided to keep this reserve for extremities, in
case, for instance, a bombardment kept us in the cellar. We all agreed to live from hand to
mouth upon what we could come by. My reflections were profound when, after half a day’s
search, I found one egg, from which I had to concoct a dish for the whole family. You laugh?
A proof that you lack imagination. With a single egg, as a base of operations, you can make
pancakes, or apple-fritters, flower-fritters, or bread-fritters, or any fritters you like. By the
way, I advise the use of nasturtiums. Rose leaves, on the other hand, are rather tasteless. But
here is something better. You make some pastry, then beat up your one egg with a glass of
milk, a few<b>[126]</b> crumbs of bread, a bit of cheese, if you have any; then you pour the mixture
on the pastry, put the whole in the oven, and when it is baked you will find a dish that will
feed six women. Oh! we made no complaints; not yet, at least. Really when a menuconsists
of a potato fricassee to which laurel and thyme have given a zest, artichokes with melted
butter and chervil—butter, replaced by grease, alas!—fresh salad, and juicy pears, who
would not pronounce himself satisfied with such a meal? Marmontel, who loved good cheer,
Marmontel in the Bastille, where he so highly appreciated the fare, Marmontel himself would
have been delighted with it.
<br><br>
The want of light was the worst of our evils. Petroleum was no more to be had, and candles
were hard to come by. Linseed oil and modest night-lights grudged us a glimmer by which
we gloomily went to bed. Therefore as soon as the night fell the fiend of melancholy seized
upon us. The dull light spread a gloom over the room we sat in, and from the black corners
dark thoughts seemed to rise and grow upon us. So we would rather walk in the garden, or
even look out of the window, when night fell, than sit at our work or our writing-table. How
many hours have I spent leaning out of the window in a nightgown, and watching the shells
burst. In September<b>[127]</b> and October, just after the Germans’ arrival, there were beautiful
moonlit nights, worthy to be worshipped on bended knees; yet I felt an inclination to imitate
Salammbô and cry to the moon with arms uplifted:
<br><br>
“O moon, I hate you. You are deceitful, unrelenting, and cold, and even the pale glimmer you
send us you steal. There is nothing true but the warm and cheerful sunbeams, which give us
light and life. You fling your silver arrows where you please, and throw what you choose
into the shade. You slip your sly rays into closed rooms, through cracks and chinks; no secret
escapes you. You favour illicit love, unpunished crimes, acts of violence, and foul deeds. All
those things you feast upon, O moon! But your light is never so pleasant, your caress never
so soft, as when you shine on a battlefield, on places where men kill one another. You take
pleasure in the sight of dead bodies, shrivelled limbs, wide-open mouths, features distorted in
the weird horror of death. You play on bloody weapons, on dark-mouthed cannon; you pass
by the wounded, crying for help, by dying men whose death-rattle is unheard, and you smile
yourself from the charnel-field, glad to leave the victims in the unfathomable shades of
night.”<b>[128]</b>
<br><br>
Moon, I hate you! Everywhere and always you have looked on murderous battles,
unbrotherly contests, man maddened against man. You saw the formidable army of Xerxes
contend with the Greeks; you saw the Roman Empire quivering at the onslaught of the
Barbarians. But can any sight you have ever witnessed be compared with that which you
look down upon to-day? Europe in arms, cannon spreading death everywhere, thousands of
men killed in the marshes of Poland, on the hills of Galicia, in France, on the plains of
Flanders? Are you pleased, O moon?
<br><br>
Moon, I hate you!
<br><br>
To shun the moon, to shut out the sound of the guns, I close the wooden shutters, pull down
the window, draw the curtains. The cannon are not silent. Chilled with cold and horror, I
fling myself on my bed, bury my head in the pillows, creep under my blankets. The cannon
still roars, and shakes my bed. I wake up, and the cannon roars louder than ever. To have
lived, and have been sometimes careless and merry, we must have been as mad and as blind
as the moon herself. But we cannot attain to the moon’s insensibility, and that is why our
laughter often turns to tears, and humour ends in a sob.
<br><br>
<b>[129]</b>
<br><br>
<center>CHAPTER VI</center>
<br><br>
Morny being near to the battlefield, we naturally saw many soldiers. The village sheltered
four convoys at a time within its walls. Officers and non-commissioned officers were billeted
on the inhabitants, and we had to bear our share of the common misfortune. And thus Barbu
and Crafleux fell to our lot.
<br><br>
Barbu and Crafleux were two Prussian officers, escaped from a toy-shop, and carefully
wound up before they were let loose from Germany. They always arrived side by side, with
the same automatic stride, the one tall, thin, and—bearded; the other short, stout,
and—crafleux. I must explain that crafleux in the popular speech of Laon means a
misbegotten, rickety creature. The name was not well chosen, for the man was solid, though
ugly; but his round, clean-shaven face, his pig’s eyes sunk deep behind white lashes, well
earned him the nickname. And Barbu himself was no Adonis. He had a small
head,<b>[130]</b> with regular features, a pointed beard, an aurified smile, cheeks seamed with
scars. His style of beauty is not that which I commend. But what matters the want of good
looks? Barbu and Crafleux revealed to us beautiful souls; they were two model Prussians.
<br><br>
One morning, then, the village constable brought in a smart sergeant, who seemed to have
been taken out of a bandbox. All bows and smiles, the young man asked for rooms, and we
dared not refuse him. The contest with Herr Mayor had been a warning to us.
<br><br>
“This will do,” he said, entering Geneviève’s room, “and this,” passing on to Yvonne’s and
Colette’s. He withdrew, still with a smile on his face, giving us full liberty to prepare the
rooms and to rail as we chose.
<br><br>
“Alas!” groaned Geneviève. “Never again shall I like my room, after I have seen a Prussian
loll on my bed.”
<br><br>
“To begin with,” I said, “you won’t see him. And secondly, I have a just and clear conception
of a Prussian’s method of repose. He stretches himself out as if he were on duty, and his head
on the pillow is carefully adorned with a helmet. He is just as proper to look upon as his
photograph would be, taken after a review.”
<br><br>
We hung tasteless chromolithographs in the<b>[131]</b> place of pretty water-colours; we took
away all the books, the knick-knacks, and the papers. Here and there Colette pinned up
peacock’s feathers—”to bring them ill-luck,” she said. Then both rooms waited with a grim
air for the unwelcome guests. Presently the orderlies came in, brought heaps of baggage, got
everything ready for their masters, and withdrew. An indiscreet curiosity prompted us to take
an inventory of the riches deposited with us. Yvonne and Colette spat, like two angry cats.
<br><br>
“Look here! Isn’t it a shame? For a single man, two boxes! five bags! portmanteaux! Well, if
he wants so much to go and fight....” Crafleux was more modest, but Barbu had certainly
imported a whole dressing-room from Germany. The day after his arrival he showed off
heaps of small brushes in small boxes, small creams in small pots, small scents in small
bottles, and photographs and photographic apparatus, electric lamps and re-fills for these
lamps, sporting guns and india-rubber cushions, soft blankets and uniforms without number.
But he was chiefly remarkable for his befrogged pyjamas of sky blue or Chinese flesh
colour! The sight of him must have been affecting when he had on his helmet by way of
nightcap! So Barbu and Crafleux installed themselves downstairs, and we<b>[132]</b> upstairs.
Yvonne settled down in a tiny attic, and Colette slept on a couch in Antoinette’s room. I gave
Geneviève a share of my own bed in the room which already sheltered the youthful Pierrot.
We were not very comfortable, and what was worse, we suffered from the cold. This requires
an explanation. Some time ago a direful rumour had spread about: “They have requisitioned
a great number of mattresses in Vivaise.” Now Vivaise is a village not far from Morny. “You
may be sure they will do the same here,” said the well-informed. And so, in all houses, the
beds were only half as high as before; and he was cunning indeed who could say what had
become of the missing part. We, for instance, have plenty of mattresses: large, soft, elastic
mattresses which would make you wish to be ill and keep your bed—and should the enemy
of France rest upon them? That shall never be, we declared. By the unanimous exertion of
the whole family, climbing, pulling, pushing, toiling, we succeeded in hoisting up most of
these useful objects, and hiding them in the loft under the roof. Every bed was left with one
only. When Barbu and Crafleux intruded themselves into the house, we were hard put to it.
One of us made shift with a palliasse, while Geneviève and I slept on a hair mattress. This
plan is not to be recommended<b>[133]</b> unless you choose to mortify your flesh, or to copy the
fakirs of India. We could have put up with our uncomfortable bedding if, to add to our
misfortune, the cold had not seized upon us. Our present guests laid their hands upon heaps
of blankets, their predecessors had stolen two, and so we had just enough, and nothing to
spare.
<br><br>
We went to sleep as straight as arrows, one on each side of the bed; we woke up in the
morning twisted into knots, one against the other, like two shivering cats. Despair drove
Yvonne from one extreme to the other; either she lay half-smothered with heat under an
enormous eider-down, or benumbed with cold under a thin cotton blanket. The authors of our
hardships tasted the honey-dew of sleep upon beds of down; they knew not that threatening
fists were shaken at them upstairs, and that bitter invectives vowed them to execration. Yet I
think that when logs unexpectedly tumbled down, and pieces of furniture joined the dance,
they gave a start and felt uneasy. But on the whole, as quiet as Vert-Vert at the Visitandines,
they led a happy life, got up between nine and ten, saw about their convoy, fed well at the
village inn, often went shooting, or, if they had a mind, drove out to Laon, came back home
to rest a while and dress for dinner, and then about ten, eleven, or midnight,<b>[134]</b> got back
into their rooms and their comfortable beds.
<br><br>
I hinted that war, conducted in this fashion, was not disagreeable. Barbu knew that I was
laughing at them.
<br><br>
“But our comrades ... who are fighting....”
<br><br>
“Do not lead such a pleasant life ... I am sure of it.”
<br><br>
“And I think ... French convoys take their ease too.”
<br><br>
“Well, I hope so.”
<br><br>
But really, Barbu, it was only right that you should live in comfort, for none knew better than
you how to appreciate it!
<br><br>
One day, going in to return a newspaper he had lent me, I surprised this lover of comforts
seated in an arm-chair, his feet on the fender, his head resting on a cushion, his back on
another, a book in his hand, a lamp behind him. He looked a perfect picture of
self-satisfaction. But such delights cannot last for ever. “The present convoys are going to the
front,” some people said. Do you hear, Barbu? You will go to the front. You will change
your carpet for the mud of the trenches, your pleasant fire for an icy fog, the studious light of
your lamp for the red glare of the shells! You will go to the front!
<br><br>
They did not go to the front. They were to<b>[135]</b> pass one or two nights in our house, and they
stayed a month!
<br><br>
The village groaned under the reign of the invaders. Every morning the housewives on their
way to the baker poured out their complaints.
<br><br>
“Have yours decent manners?”
<br><br>
“Oh, mine are very hard to please!”
<br><br>
And the gossips began to tell their grievances, for many of these undesirable guests were in
truth very hard to please, and their manners were detestable. They wiped their filthy boots on
the beds and arm-chairs, deluged the carpets and floors with water; they burnt the furniture
and linen with their cigars. They came back very late at night, generally tipsy, went to the
kitchen, searched the larder and sideboard, and cooked an extra meal with the stolen goods.
The mistress of the house deemed herself very happy when she was not aroused from a
well-earned sleep and ordered to go and rattle about saucepans and kitchen ranges. Of course,
Barbu and Crafleux would have repudiated such methods with disgust. Barbu and Crafleux
piqued themselves on their gentlemanly manners. Barbu and Crafleux were two model
Prussians.
<br><br>
For truth’s sake I must admit that occasionally they came home after midnight amiably drunk,
and—I am a credible witness—danced<b>[136]</b> a jig in the yard. But these are venial sins, and
our watch-dogs themselves, who from the first day had been hand in glove with the officers,
looked indulgently upon such gambols. Gracieuse was even accused of cherishing a guilty
passion for Crafleux, having once been discovered, curled into a ball, upon the bed of the
gentleman aforesaid-a most improper act for a lady dog brought up never to enter the house.
Another fault was ascribed to Barbu. On the officers’ arrival, we had held a secret meeting to
discuss the question of lights. At length we decided to give one candle to each man, having
laid by a box in case of emergency. The next morning we discovered a scandal unheard of.
Barbu ... his candle ... a virgin candle, a white, shapely candle! The criminal had burnt it up
in a single night! A huge candle which in the present state of things was worth its weight in
gold! A few waxen tears, still hanging to the socket, bore witness to the poor thing’s death.
We put in its stead a dumpy one, whose loss we should not feel so deeply, and after that he
must provide others for himself. He must provide his firing also. As a matter of fact he did.
One day the officers demanded fires in their rooms.
<br><br>
“Very well, the charwoman will look after it. But ... fuel runs short.”<b>[137]</b>
<br><br>
Barbu wrote at once a note of hand, gave it to the smart bustling sergeant, and the day after
ten sacks of coal were brought and discharged in the coach-house. We gazed at the black
heap with envious eyes, for we used to do our cooking and warm our rooms with a poor
faggot of wood.
<br><br>
The officers very well knew that we lacked all kinds of stores, and Barbu asked me once in a
roundabout way if they might offer us some petroleum and sugar.
<br><br>
“We have just received an abundant supply,” he said, “and shall be enchanted if you will
make use of them.”
<br><br>
This was worthy of reflection. We answered at last that we would gratefully take their
proffered goods, on condition that we might pay for them.
<br><br>
My sisters-in-law made a great outcry against this proposal.
<br><br>
“Never,” said they, “will we receive presents from Prussians!”
<br><br>
“Gently,” I replied. “To begin with, we pay in cash for their ‘presents’; then our hospitality,
forced as it is, is worthy of some recompense. And, indeed, it is ridiculous to speak of ‘their’
merchandise. Is it not stolen goods? Does it not come from our bonded warehouses and
stores?<b>[138]</b> Besides, is it not a good deed to help in exhausting their provisions?”
<br><br>
So petroleum and sugar, flanked with coffee and rice, reappeared in the house, and were
highly appreciated by all, in spite of their Teutonic origin.
<br><br>
But when the officers carried kindness so far as to offer us a hare of their own shooting, they
embarrassed us sorely. Though we were not tempted to accept the gift, we thought a denial
would offend our dangerous guests.
<br><br>
“We have too many,” Barbu said artlessly; “yesterday we have shot a roebuck, seven hares,
and twelve partridges in the wood of Bucy.”
<br><br>
In our own wood! Very well, we accept the hare; it will not pay for the rent of the shooting,
so we feasted upon jugged hare, and found the very French flavour much to our taste.
<br><br>
Barbu and Crafleux were two model Prussians. I do not unsay it. I even think I have proved
it. But a Prussian is always a Prussian, and the best of the brood will never understand certain
things.
<br><br>
“Is your piano dumb?” asked Barbu one day.
<br><br>
A few dances might have cheered up the house, he thought, and the roar of the guns and the
clatter of German feet in the street would have<b>[139]</b> been the best possible accompaniment.
Another day, this same Barbu—to tell the truth he talked to me with his pipe in his mouth,
but you cannot expect much from men brought up in Heidelberg—this same Barbu asked me
if I would not go for a drive to Laon with him and some fellow-officers.
<br><br>
“It will be a good opportunity for shopping,” he said. “No? The other ladies will not either?
Last week I dared not ask you, our carriage was too modest, but to-day we have one of the
Prince of Monaco’s coaches.”
<br><br>
Barbu still wonders why we refused. Then something still better happened. When the officers
had settled themselves in our house, we made up our minds that the Germans should not
catch sight of us in the passage, and the order was given, “Disappear”; and the Germans
never saw the pretty faces which swarmed about us. But since I am a married woman and
proficient in German—my mother-in-law does not understand a word of it—I had been
appointed spokeswoman to the officers in case of need.
<br><br>
But one day I suppose the intruders caught sight of a golden head in flight, and Barbu asked
me:
<br><br>
“There are young girls in the house?”
<br><br>
“Yes, my four sisters-in-law.”<b>[140]</b>
<br><br>
“Really, we had not the least idea of it.”
<br><br>
The next day I happened to go into the drawing-room. The blinds were down, and the door
was open into the passage. An unaccustomed object was lying on the table. Bless me, it was
a box of chocolates! Delicious sweets, no doubt of it! And on the cover Barbu had written in
his neatest hand and best French, “Sacrifice to the invisible spirits.” Every one came and
contemplated the gift and the autograph with laughter. Then we allowed the poor chocolates
to get damp in the dimly lighted room. They disappeared three weeks after as mysteriously
as they had come, the day of “our Prussians’” departure. May they lie lightly on Barbu’s
stomach!
<br><br>
At last the convoy left Morny. On the morning on which they were to start Barbu plunged us
into an ocean of perplexities by asking us:
<br><br>
“You do not mind my taking a few snapshots of your house, do you?”
<br><br>
“Certainly ... not, sir.”
<br><br>
“I should be very happy if one or two of the young ladies consented to sit at a window.”
<br><br>
And nobody had prompted him in that! In vain I objected that the hour was early, and that
my sisters-in-law got up very late.
<br><br>
“Oh, it does not matter,” said he. “We<b>[141]</b> will wait for them. Ask the ladies to get ready,
and we will come back in half an hour.”
<br><br>
Think how nice it would be in a year or two in Berlin, or Leipzig, or Heidelberg, to show a
few photographs! “Here are a few souvenirs of our victorious stay in France! In that house
we led a very happy life. The young ladies whom you see were reluctant hostesses, but the
French, breathing revenge, were obliged to welcome us!”
<br><br>
The whole family was in a fury of anger.
<br><br>
“Of course, it is out of the question to comply with all the wishes of these wretched
Prussians!”
<br><br>
Two days before Barbu had invited his brothers-in-arms to dinner. Upon this occasion he
asked us for a table-cloth, a large table-cloth.
<br><br>
We took out of its dark hiding-place a damask cloth and eighteen napkins.
<br><br>
“Is that what you want, sir?”
<br><br>
“We wish vases also.”
<br><br>
“Will these do?”
<br><br>
“And we desire flowers.”
<br><br>
“Take some asters from the garden.”
<br><br>
And then:
<br><br>
“May I take a photograph of your house?”
<br><br>
“Sir, I cannot prevent you.”
<br><br>
“Will you put a smiling face at the window?”
<br><br>
No, no, a truce to jesting. Give him a flat denial. But how? On taking leave the
Germans<b>[142]</b> would certainly try to shake hands with us, that is their way, and we were
determined not to shake theirs. Would they take it amiss?
<br><br>
More than once it had proved hazardous to irritate these dangerous guests. Mme. Valbot in
Lierval saw her house plundered. Why? She had refused to sew on a button for the officer
who lodged in her house.
<br><br>
Old Vadois, the confectioner in Laon, was listening to the tales of “his Prussian.”
<br><br>
“The people are not kind enough to the soldiers,” the officer said. “The French are better
received in Alsace-Lorraine than we are here.”
<br><br>
“So the French are in Alsace-Lorraine!” the old man cried out, with a blissful look.
<br><br>
“Soldiers, take this man into custody, he speaks ill of the Germans,” roared the officer. And
they threw the poor wretch into a dungeon, where he slept on straw.
<br><br>
Our neighbour Polinchard, who is something of a simpleton, was pruning his pear-trees one
day, when he saw his enforced boarders making fruitless endeavours to open a fastened door.
“Not through this one,” he cried, waving them back with a motion of his pruning knife, and
pointing to the usual entrance.
<br><br>
“What now!” cried the soldiers. “He<b>[143]</b> threatens us! He threatens Germans! Away with
him to prison!”
<br><br>
The culprit was condemned to two months. That is why, on reflection, we hesitated to offend
Barbu and Crafleux. They had been kind, well-behaved men, certainly, but in the village they
were looked upon as haughty, violent, and hard-hearted.
<br><br>
“What will Barbu say,” we wondered, “if, when he holds out his large paws, we put our
hands behind our backs? Will he send us to prison, and put us on bread and water? Will he
fasten us to the stirrups of his horse and drag us to Laon all six in a line? or will he give some
such order as this to the commandant of the village: ‘Should an opportunity come, billet fifty
men on these people’?”
<br><br>
A pleasant prospect! The moment was critical. I made up my mind to brazen it out. There is
always—I had quite forgotten this—a chord, or rather a cable, in all German hearts, and this
chord or cable is sentiment. Let us, then, proceed by sentiment.
<br><br>
I advance. My countenance is that of an angel; my eyes are full of melancholy, my voice is
honey-sweet, my hair ... no, it is not dishevelled, or at least only morally dishevelled. I began
to talk. Of course my mother-in-law had<b>[144]</b> no objection to their taking photographs of the
house. But they would permit us not to appear at the windows. The gentlemen would
understand our feelings. They were men of heart and intelligence. They had been very kind
to us, and we were very grateful to them, but ... I became animated. “But we are at war with
you ... we cannot help seeing in you the invaders of our country, and I am sure you are aware
that certain things are painful to us! You know how hard it would be to your wives and
sisters to receive strangers. You cannot wonder at our dealing with you as with adversaries.
And I must tell you that every time I see you I think with an inward thrill of terror, ‘This man
may kill my husband.’”
<br><br>
I had done. I wept with emotion. Crafleux was gazing at his boots with a shake of his head.
Tears stood in Barbu’s eyes, and through this sentimental haze he saw his wife receiving
French soldiers. As to myself, I felt I would soon have to blow my nose. My mother-in-law
beheld the scene in silence, waiting to know the effect of my harangue. It proved effectual.
<br><br>
“Madam, believe me, we understand and respect your feelings. We have now only to thank
you for your hospitality, and to assure you we shall always remember it.”<b>[145]</b>
<br><br>
They bowed themselves out of the room, bowed again from the threshold, bowed again in the
yard. We heard the gate close behind them, a silence while they took a few snapshots, and
then the rolling away of their carriage.
<br><br>
They were gone! Gone for ever! And no hindrances had stood in the way! They had gone
leaving behind six sacks of coal.... They had gone even leaving a letter of recommendation
for the officers who would take their place!
<br><br>
God forbid I shall ever revile the memory of Barbu and Crafleux!
<br><br>
<b>[146]</b>
<br><br>
<center>CHAPTER VII</center>
<br><br>
After the convoy’s departure Morny was empty. The only Prussians left were those who held
the lines of communication and a few soldiers at the sugar factory. We walked abroad
without meeting the enemy at every turn; in brief, we felt at home again. We were all like
people crushed by a landslip, who recover their breath, and take on again their former shape
as the earth disappears which overwhelmed them. But, alas, it was out of the question to
forget the past! Empty barns, stables, and poultry-yards deprived of their inhabitants bore
witness to the passage of the scourge.
<br><br>
Other things also proved that the wind was blowing from the east, whence came the
all-devouring grasshoppers.
<br><br>
One morning, as I came back from a quest after milk, I stood still, struck with amazement,
and followed the example of the dairy-woman in the fable. I looked at the village steeple,
and could<b>[147]</b> make nothing of the time it proclaimed to the four points of the compass. Old
Tassin happened to pass by.
<br><br>
“Well, Mme. Valaine,” said he, “what do you make of this? It is German time up there. We
are Prussians now!”
<br><br>
I lifted up my eyes to the sky, and, seeing the sun, felt easier in my mind. No change there; it
was eight, not nine o’clock. Yet they had made fruitless attempts to set the sun by the
German time I was sure. That is why I saw officers cast reproachful looks at the sun, which
dared tell the French time in a territory occupied by Germans! That was playing them false.
That was treason, and the sun would rue it bitterly.
<br><br>
A certain regiment, passing through Morny, chanced to trust to the village clock, and did not
reach its goal at the appointed time. The delay was the cause of a failure, which put some
big-wigs with helmets on into a rage. In short, the village constable was ordered to put the
machine right, the German time being the only right time under the sun.
<br><br>
However, the departure of our guests set us at ease, and the whole village along with us. As
the village might not revictual itself officially, it revictualled itself by fraud, and as much as
possible.<b>[148]</b> Now there lives in Morny a sympathetic drunkard named Durand. Fond of
quarrelling as he is in his cups, when in a sober state he is a good, kindly soul. He had been
invalided, because his hands were twisted by gout, and this infirmity rendered him equally
unfit for the work of the fields; so he became a tradesman. He deals usually in rabbit-skins,
scrap-iron, and rags. His business and stock-in-trade consist of a box set up on two wheels,
and drawn by a good-natured yellow dog. Scrap-iron may hide a good many things, and with
a view to present circumstances our friend contrived to extend his import trade. Far from me
to hint that Durand, in ordinary times, snaps his fingers at the gendarmes and laughs at the
laws, practices as common in our border departments as unseemly everywhere. But he
improvised with the war a wonderful cunning, thanks to which he smuggled all sorts of
necessary things into Morny, under the Germans’ very eyes. In his surprise packet were
concealed butter, grease, chocolate, sugar, to say nothing of candles. The housewives
scrambled for the provisions, which rose almost to the usual level. The weary dog put out his
tongue and laughed, for he knew well that we were getting the better of the Germans.
<br><br>
He was not the only one to laugh. The<b>[149]</b> peasants, too, laughed in their sleeves when they
saw the Germans stock still in “the mountains.” At the first moment of invasion, the people
were struck with dismay. The arrogant enemy, sure of victory, seemed to meet with no
obstacles. “Handsome men, well armed and equipped. Ah, there is no reason to laugh at
them!” said the old women. They thought the situation hopeless. But now it was whispered
about, “They won’t pass ‘the mountains’; they won’t cross the Aisne.” At this conviction their
hearts rose, which yesterday had been filled with bitterness. Evidently the invaders had been
stopped; they knew not how, but the fact remained.
<br><br>
One morning I encountered a knot of gossips in the street. They talked of a new attack on
Soissons. Mme. Tassin assured us that William had said they must pass, and pass they must.
Without stopping in my walk, I interjected: “And General Pau said that they won’t pass, and
pass they won’t.” It was reported that a French prisoner had spoken these words in Laon.
Whether General Pau had really expressed himself thus I don’t know. But the Germans
gained no more ground; we were sure of that; but it was no less certain that we were caught
in a trap, that we could not stir a limb. We had good hopes the trial would not last long. All
the same<b>[150]</b> the situation could not be helped, and we resolved to accept it. In the village,
things were going tolerably. While the baker’s wife, gallant soul, made her bread, the work of
the fields progressed slowly. They left the beetroots as long as possible in the earth,
expecting that “our French” would come back before the harvest, which was superb. At
length they had to submit to fate and bury the precious roots in vast silos. With us the days
crawled by like centuries. It is true that the housekeeping entirely rested with us; it was no
use looking for help in the village; women who had not a good many children to look after
were working out in the fields. Only Mme. Tassin consented from time to time to come and
help us. But how many hours, what long evenings, remained to fill for six women shut up in
a house! What, indeed, can you do at home but dream if you are a hare, and sew if you are a
woman? We sewed.
<br><br>
After Barbu’s stay a little petroleum was left, which we used with miserly care. At dinner we
contented ourselves with a night-light, and when we worked only our heads were allowed to
come within the circuit of the lamp.
<br><br>
We made sets of baby-linen for poor little ones who took it into their heads to be born into
the world, when their fathers had gone off to the war,<b>[151]</b>and had left larder and purse at
home empty. We competed with one another in the making of caps and shirts. Yvonne is
amazingly clever, and when she has a mind to sew works no end of wonders in a trice. Our
ambition increased with success. We fashioned web-like laces, and our embroidery might
have aroused the jealousy of the fairies. Generally we kept silence. Sighs frequently
answered the guns, and if we talked we poured out plaints of pity for those who fought, or
called up remembrances of happier days.
<br><br>
“Just think, there are people who get letters!”
<br><br>
We moaned at the thought of our deprivation.
<br><br>
“Lucky people! They know if their relations are dead or alive.”
<br><br>
“At this very moment there are some who read the papers!”
<br><br>
“Oh, rage! oh, despair! oh, hostile blockade!”
<br><br>
“And there are some people who know the truth! When shall we see a newspaper again?”
<br><br>
“At this very moment some are enjoying ... nice things to eat!”
<br><br>
“Oh, for a tea at Rumpelmayer’s!”
<br><br>
“Oh, for chocolates from Pihan!”
<br><br>
Such memories did but sharpen the thorn of our hunger. And yet we had not lost all the
pleasures of life. For instance, do you suppose<b>[152]</b> we had given up having tea in the
afternoon? By no means. It is highly important that women should swallow something good
and hot about five o’clock. Simple toast was the only dainty we allowed ourselves.
Well-buttered toast with a well-sugared cup of tea is not to be despised. Hold! Toast, yes, but
no butter! The little we had was jealously salted and reserved for cooking. And tea? Do you
think tea a native of the department of the Aisne? Tea was no more to be had. Sugar was so
scarce that we never ate a single lump without a family council to decide whether it was the
proper moment. Fortunately I found a recipe of my grandmother’s at the bottom of my
reticule. I requisitioned all the licorice in Morny. Mme. Lantois’ walnut-tree provided us at
little cost with a basketful of green shining leaves. Walnut leaves are like good women: in
the long run they may lose their beauty, but they retain their virtue. These leaves then, boiled
with licorice, gave us a delicious drink all the winter, which had nothing in common with the
pale decoctions we nowadays moisten our throats with at the end of a dinner-party. I had
been careful to say negligently: “This tea is excellent for the complexion. Regularly taken, it
would greatly improve the skin, and give it a matchless bloom.”<b>[153]</b>
<br><br>
No one ever missed the afternoon tea. This ceremony, indeed, was often transformed into a
great patriotic meeting, vibrating with despair and lamentations, or with enthusiasm and hope,
according to the news of the day. For news we had, though I said we got none, and it was
commented upon with passion. Our news of course was all unofficial, and evil or good rode
fast. It spread throughout the country; it floated in the air; it came from every quarter. When I
left Mme. Lantois’ dairy with a can full of milk, my pocket was also full of news; likewise if
we went to the baker, or if we called on M. Lonet.
<br><br>
The initiated came back in a hurry, called the whole family to gather round, and feverishly
told the news. We ended by putting a bell in the dining-room, known as “the war bell.” If one
of us heard anything fresh, she rushed into the room and frantically rang the bell. From the
garden, the attic, the bedrooms we flocked, allured by the hope of good tidings.
<br><br>
“What has happened? What is going on?”
<br><br>
Marvellous things always happened.
<br><br>
Periodically—at least twice a month—neighbouring towns were retaken by the French.
<br><br>
“You know, that cannonade ... so violent ... simply meant that our soldiers recovered St.
Quentin.”<b>[154]</b>
<br><br>
Noyon also was reconquered I do not know how many times, and La Fère retaken with
bayonets. Once the news really seemed worthy of belief. The Germans had put it up in Laon:
“La Fère has been in a cowardly manner retaken by the French.” We thought it true. Really,
now, who would make up such an adjective? The Germans had certainly used it. On inquiry
it was found that the adjective, like the news, had been invented, and the bill had never
existed at all. Glorious feats were just as frequent on the front near us.
<br><br>
“The Route des Dames ... you know?... The French have held it since yesterday. And to-night
they have carried the village of Ailles.”
<br><br>
“Really, I thought they took it last week.”
<br><br>
“Last week it was a false report; to-day the thing is certain.”
<br><br>
And the Allies! Think how they worked!
<br><br>
“Seventy thousand Russians have just landed at Antwerp. The English are shelling Hamburg.
Our Northern army is advancing, yes, it is...; deliverance will come from the North.”
<br><br>
Ah, the secret of making legends is not lost! Popular imagination invents hundreds of them.
But nowadays they cannot live long. Books and newspapers cut their wings as soon as they
are hatched, and the poor things flutter an instant,<b>[155]</b> and then die. But imagine a corner of
a country like ours, perfectly isolated from the rest of the world for some ten years, and
deprived of all news, all writings; suppose the peasants should be questioned long after upon
the events of the present war, from their statements you might compose the most beautiful
epic poem ever heard. As in the good old time, its title would be, “The Gestes of the French
by the Grace of God.”
<br><br>
Frenchmen, my brothers, I know you were splendid. You fought like lions, like the heroes
that you are. Your glorious feats are too numerous to be counted. It was our despair not to
know them. But, in revenge, we invented feats for you, fresh ones every day. Once, for
instance, the French, masters of the stone-quarries of Paissy, made good use of a secret
passage, and leaping unexpectedly from out of the ground, flick, flack, flick, spread death
and dismay among the Germans; then, like jacks-in-the-box, they disappeared as if by magic.
Struck with consternation, the Germans would have thought themselves dreaming had not
too many proofs testified to the reality of the brief apparition. And what do you think of
the chasseurs à pied who, behind a hedge at Malva, planted a forest of poles with a cap on
the top of every one, and then, when the enemy with loud cries were in the very act<b>[156]</b> of
rushing upon this trap, shot them down to the very last man?
<br><br>
And don’t let us forget the Africans. Ten negroes from Senegal—you understand,
ten—sprang out of their trenches on a night as black as ink—of course we did not know
whether negroes were or were not in the trenches—noiselessly crept along the ground
through brushwood and darkness, and shouting their war-cry bounded forward into the
village of Chamouille. Panic-stricken, the German soldiers fled, while the
officers—seventeen in number—not one more, not one less—let the Africans cut their
throats like so many lambs. The ten negroes lay down once more, flat on their faces, and
crawling along on their hands and knees, went back to their trenches without a tassel missing
from their caps, without a rent dishonouring their large breeches. These anecdotes were our
daily bread. Innumerable were the villages taken by surprise, the convoys seized, the
batteries triumphantly brought in. We were always breathless; every one of us lent a
half-sceptical ear to everything that was said, and tried to detect a little truth among all this
fiction. Who invented or transformed the news? It was difficult to know. Many a time Mr.
Nobody-knows-who had confided it to Mrs. So-and-So, who told it to Mr. Everybody.
But<b>[157]</b> generally the information came from the best sources. If M. H., the Mayor of Laon,
had really said all that was ascribed to him, he had done nothing else but commit the secrets
of our army to the office-porter or the fruiterer over the way. On the other hand, it is hard to
conceive how many secrets our countrymen extracted from their German guests. Speaking of
the officers to whom they gave hospitality they assumed a mysterious air, and hinted that,
walking delicately, they had elicited from them avowals as mortifying for their pride as
encouraging for us.
<br><br>
But there was another origin, quite modern, for the news no one wanted to take upon himself.
It was no difficult riddle. The news came from Heaven. Aviators dropped it. Letters had been
picked up here and there, said rumour; some of them were evidently home-made, and were
but laughed at—this one, for instance: “Friends, take courage; reinforcements are coming.” A
touching contrivance of some ingenious liar to cheer up his neighbours!
<br><br>
Other messages, written in a kind of official style, were so precise that they seemed worthy
of attention; and one of them, known throughout the country as the message of Magny, was
for a long time looked upon as authentic by the most competent judges. Oh, we were very
credulous,<b>[158]</b> and you laugh at us, all of you, who read the papers every morning at your
breakfast. We were so cruelly crushed by the invaders, so uneasy at hearing nothing, so eager
for news which might have been bones for our anxiety to gnaw that we greedily snatched at
all the falsehoods we came across, and found our mouths a minute after full of sand.
<br><br>
Was there no means of encouraging us? Floods of sentimental ink were wasted elsewhere
upon our fate, but the smallest drop spilt in the Vernandois or the Laonnois would have done
us more good.
<br><br>
We had not deserved thus to be forsaken, for we were admirable. I maintain, laying aside all
useless modesty, I maintain that we were admirable. Our persons and properties had been
given up as hostages. A line was chalked out on the map; it was the part to be sacrificed. In
this part we were shut up, bodies and souls, with no possibility of shaking ourselves free. We
not only suffered it to be so; we agreed to the bargain; we resigned ourselves to hunger,
misfortune, oppression. We submitted to see our houses plundered, our forests levelled with
the ground, our lands destroyed, so that the rest of the country might be safe, the metropolis
undamaged, that France herself might be free to<b>[159]</b> recover her power and to prepare her
vengeance. Exposed to violence, requisitions, even to reprisals, we did not give way; we
wished for victory, never for peace; we thought of France, not of ourselves. But what
unbearable pangs did we bear! We laboured under “the hope deferred that maketh the heart
sick,” as the Bible says. Sometimes we seemed to think the burden too heavy for our strength
and impossible to be borne any longer. What became of us when, in the last days of October,
the Germans arrogantly announced that they had won a victory at Soissons, that they had
broken through, and that they were going on to Paris...? “Parisse!... Parisse!...”
<br><br>
We were heart-broken by it, sunk in desolation, and when thereupon came the welcome
message of Magny, full of excellent things, although scandalously false, should we not have
believed it true? Rather than not to have believed it, we should have framed and hung a copy
in every house!
<br><br>
The message of Magny made its appearance on All Saints’ Day. On coming back from the
cemetery we watched the shelling of a French aeroplane, which laughed at its assailant, and
the smoke of the shells was like small round balls gilt by the sun. The cannon rolled
furiously<b>[160]</b> in the direction of Noyon, and we thought: “If they have passed, it is not over
there.”
<br><br>
In the village we heard the good news that every one whispered in his neighbour’s ear: “They
haven’t passed; on the contrary, they have been soundly beaten at Vailly. Besides, aviators
have dropped a letter near Magny, copies of which are passing from hand to hand.”
<br><br>
They have not passed! They have been beaten! Oh, joy! how lovely is the day! And how near
is the Capitol to the Tarpeian Rock! Yesterday we lay on the ground broken with the shock;
to-day, lively and drunk with joy, we rush with a bound towards the regions of trust and
hope!
<br><br>
Our best source of news was Mme. Lantois’. The kitchen of the farm is a large, gay, bright
room, whose painted walls, black and white flags, glittering copper saucepans, and cages full
of song-birds, are pleasant to the eye. A select society was to be met there about five in the
evening. To find a seat you had to disturb one of the cats which lay enthroned on all free
chairs. To upset a cat is high treason. To remain standing would have looked uncivil. I used
to get out of the scrape by taking on my lap Gros-Blanc, Yé-Yé, or Belle-Limace, who
seemed to approve of this arrangement.
<br><br>
All tongues were let loose.<b>[161]</b>
<br><br>
First, we exchanged and commented upon the news of the day. What troops—infantry,
cavalry, artillery—had been seen in Morny and its neighbourhood, whether there were many
of them and which direction they took, whether the trains were loaded with soldiers or
ammunition—these were the questions asked and answered. Then we were told what
wounded soldiers and prisoners had been brought to Laon, and heard what motor-cars had
traversed the village. Twice the Emperor himself was seen within our gates in an iron-plated
car, preceded and followed by two cars occupied by soldiers armed to the teeth. Upon this
occasion the Prussians of the village posted on both sides of the road had bawled themselves
hoarse to such a degree that they had been obliged to run to the next cellar in order to
moisten their gullets. Hundreds of pairs of eyes, moreover, had watched the sky and
discovered aeroplanes—English or French—which had been fired at by such and such a
battery. The German flying machines had been disporting themselves here or there. The
captive balloon—”William’s sausage”—had perched above certain points. How many of us
had, the night before, observed the signals that came from Laon or glittered in the
“mountains”?
<br><br>
The ears had just as much to do as the eyes.<b>[162]</b> Guns had been fired from this quarter and
that, German cannon or French, ordnance or fieldpiece. In one direction a mine had been
fired. In fine weather we heard the sound of rifles or the crackling of mitrailleuses. One
stormy day the workmen declared that they had heard the French bugles sound for a charge.
What a fine harvest of news we gathered every evening! What would we not have given to
be able to hand it on to those who might have turned it to good account! When we had gone
all over it again there followed a warmly conducted debate; we drew conclusions as to the
successes or reverses each side had met with, or as to the positions they occupied.
<br><br>
But as it is impossible always to be discussing strategy, and as we could talk only of the war,
we fell to telling stories. And many of them touched upon our general flight before the
Germans and its failure.
<br><br>
M. and Mme. Lantois, with their son René, a big lad of eighteen, had tried to run away
too—not, like ourselves, on foot, but in a cart drawn by two stout horses. The prudent hands
of the farmer’s wife had heaped up in the bottom of the vehicle two sacks of flour, a keg of
wine, a barrel of salt pork, two hundred eggs, and even thirty bottles of petroleum. No matter
whither they<b>[163]</b> would have to go, they were thus prepared for any events. The first hours
all went well, but near Nouvion-le-Vineux the fugitives were overtaken by the French army.
They were ordered to draw up on the roadside and wait. Night fell. The soldiers kept on
advancing. A cannon happened to break down and got somewhat injured. So the weary
farmer went to sleep leaning against a post, while his wife, lantern in hand, gave a light to the
poor gunners, who, cursing and swearing, did their best to mend the damaged wheel. The
stream of men flowed on uninterruptedly till the morning. The good people, who had kept
out of the way all this time, thought the moment propitious to resume their journey. They put
the horses to, and were about to move forward, when they were startled by a loud shout.
Fresh soldiers were advancing, and ... they were Prussians.
<br><br>
“I am sure,” Mme. Lantois said, “that at this point they were not three miles away from our
rearguard.”
<br><br>
Horses, cart, provisions, and even petroleum—ogres turn up their noses at nothing—were
swallowed in a mouthful. The three fugitives, despoiled and abashed, came back on foot to
Morny, all whose inhabitants returned to their houses sheepish and downcast.<b>[164]</b>
<br><br>
In other places the Germans were not even put to the trouble of despoiling the people, who of
their own free will sacrificed to the new-comers. They mistook them for English soldiers. In
Festieux, for instance, not far from us, the urchins of the village cried out:
<br><br>
“The English are coming!”
<br><br>
And the peasants crowded about them. They had already stripped themselves for the French,
but all the same they were eager to welcome the Allies. And they poured out wine and coffee,
they offered fruit and biscuits. The woman who told us this story, after she had shared a
whole pail of lemonade among “those poor boys who were so hot,” went to the tallest of the
band, a man with gold lace, and, in a very loud voice so that he might understand French the
better, said to him:
<br><br>
“Well, as a reward, you will bring us William’s head!”
<br><br>
The man spread out his face in a broad grin, and, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,
answered:
<br><br>
“We no English, we Germans....”
<br><br>
Tableau!
<br><br>
This comical scene had its tragic side. In the same village were still two French foot soldiers.
A kindly soul ran to call them.<b>[165]</b>
<br><br>
“Come quick, there are English soldiers here! We are all brothers.”
<br><br>
Smiling, the soldiers came up.
<br><br>
“You idiots!” they cried, “they are Prussians!”
<br><br>
And, climbing upon a carriage which happened to stand there, they opened fire upon the
invaders.
<br><br>
The Germans replied, a refugee was wounded, the women screamed, all fled and hid
themselves. Of the two courageous soldiers, one, alas, was killed, and the other taken
prisoner.
<br><br>
More than once we heard accounts of the fighting from eye-witnesses. M. and Mme. Robert,
large landowners of Ailles, told us how their village had been occupied by the enemy. Every
day German patrols had been seen in the place; but one morning the French came back. All
fell into raptures, kissed one another, marvelled at the return, dug up their treasures, and kept
the day as a feast. In the evening the youths of the village went for a walk with the Zouaves,
listening to the warriors’ tales, and the fiddler of the village played madly the sole tune that
he knew.
<br><br>
The next morning, about half-past five, Mme. Robert, looking out of the window, said to her
husband:<b>[166]</b>
<br><br>
“Look, some one is trying to get in through the orchard gate.”
<br><br>
In truth, some one was coming in. The Germans had arrived in great numbers; they sprang
up from all sides.
<br><br>
Our soldiers were ready. A close fight took place in the orchards, in the gardens, in the barns,
and chiefly in the big yard of the farm. At the outset of the skirmish an officer had pushed
the inhabitants into the kitchen:
<br><br>
“Stay there, don’t go out.”
<br><br>
The defenders of the village had to fight against fearful odds, and yet many Germans seemed
to play their part reluctantly. Some of them took refuge in the barns, and hid themselves to
avoid the scuffle. Then a captain came up, armed with a kind of whip, the leather thongs of
which were weighted with tiny leaden balls, and with this he vigorously lashed his soldiers
until they returned to the hottest of the fight. The Zouaves fought like lions, but they were
only 250 against an enemy ten times superior in number, and in spite of their efforts at last
gave way. Another German officer, noticing civilians in a room, cried aloud with anger, and
shut them up in an empty cellar. For a long time the prisoners heard the noise of the fight
going on above their heads, and little by little it became less violent<b>[167]</b>, and then ceased
completely. Only the third day, in the morning, were the poor people taken out of the cellar,
half-dead with hunger and cold. M. and Mme. Robert were still dressed as at the moment of
the surprise, their naked feet light slippered, he with a night-cap and white ducks on, she in a
morning-jacket and short petticoats. They were not even allowed to go in for a minute to eat
a bit of food and take clothes and money. It may be supposed that the German soldiers,
always thrifty, had safely put into their pockets all that was worth stealing. Accompanied by
soldiers, the poor people had to go on foot to Laon, half-naked and starved.
<br><br>
“Going through Chamouille,” said Mme. Robert, “I was so hungry that I ate the potato
peelings I found in the street.”
<br><br>
In Laon, the prisoners were set at liberty, and they went to relations of theirs, who did their
best to comfort and clothe them.
<br><br>
“Such rich people, too!” concluded the scandalised narrator.
<br><br>
Discussions and stories were not the only things that allured me to the farm. I had a secret
there, the mystery of my life. I realised a dream cherished since my girlhood—I learned to
milk the cows. At nightfall I jumped out of my window, fled to the warm stable, and
there<b>[168]</b> strove hard to draw milk from Lolotte’s distended udders. She was a splendid
large-horned cow, which has since been requisitioned so that her milk might be reserved for
his Excellency the General So-and-So. The good animal mistook me for an awkward calf,
and, looking at me with commiseration, endeavoured to lick me tenderly. Oh, we acquired
many talents we never had dared to aspire to before the war. We sawed wood, we dug in the
garden. And everywhere it was the same; all tried to make up with their imagination and
their work for the many things that were wanting. René Lantois contrived an excellent
blacking with soot and wax. Our neighbours grated and boiled their beetroots and so made
treacle that they used instead of sugar, while a grocer manufactured sweets which were a
great success among the urchins of the place. And the forest saw more women cutting wood
than ever it had seen men.
<br><br>
When we were dissatisfied with the local products, we went off to Laon. I think that a
longing for movement peculiar to all captive animals chiefly drew us to such adventures.
<br><br>
Laon may be small and provincial, but while you are there it gives you the impression of a
town. You see tall houses, narrow streets, and policemen just as you see them in a
capital.<b>[169]</b> Booksellers, chemists, and dentists smile at you at every corner of the streets.
These institutions, which civilised people cannot do without, are scarcely to be met in Morny.
Therefore, and despite the uncertain times we lived in, we rarely let a fortnight pass without
organising an expedition to our county town. Two or three of us went off, accompanied by
the anxiety and good wishes of the family, and returned home in triumph, bringing back
good news, balls of thread and worsted for our needles, and on lucky days a few pounds of
provisions.
<br><br>
Thus it was that Yvonne and I went once to Laon on foot—the only method of travelling at
our disposal—with our neighbour Mme. Lantois. Our shopping done, we could not help
going in the direction of the “Agence,” a big building, a sort of agricultural Exchange, in
which French soldiers were being nursed. Of course we were forbidden to visit the prisoners.
But by good luck, two hundred and fifty of them were just starting for Germany, and we had
but to wait a moment for them. We saw them go down the flight of steps, limping and
looking piteous and ill. They fell into line on the foot pavement. Oh, what sad happiness it
was to see once more their dear caps, their red trousers, their lively faces, when we had met
only wooden heads for<b>[170]</b> nearly two months. Many were too weak to stand, and they
dropped on benches, or on the steps of the staircase. A Turco sat down on the pavement with
a far-away air. “Mektoub!” As they were going away we wanted to get something to give
them. Not a shop was open save the chemist’s over the way. We went in to buy cough
lozenges of all kinds. Owing to the circumstance the chemist let his whole stock go at the
lowest possible price, and his wife loaded us with piles of handkerchiefs. So we divided our
poor gifts right and left. A big dark-haired lad felt the fine linen with pleasure.
<br><br>
“A handkerchief! Think, these last two months I never had one!”
<br><br>
Their guardians did not prevent us from talking to the prisoners, but when they caught sight
of an officer they sent us rudely away. Most of the captives had been wounded and taken in
the neighbourhood of Craonne, Berry-au-Bac, and La Ville au Bois. They did not complain,
said they had been pretty well treated, but they were unanimous in adding:
<br><br>
“The English are most wretched; they are tormented in every possible way.”
<br><br>
Presently we saw the English prisoners get down the steps in their turn, half a dozen big, thin
men with worn countenances that moved our pity.<b>[171]</b>
<br><br>
A stout German under-officer thought well to give us his opinion: “Here are the English!”
said he. “Look at their pigs’ heads. They ought all to be shot; not the French,” he added, to be
agreeable, “only the English.” We wanted the poor Tommies to have their share too. As I
was threading my way through the crowd and they were stretching out their hands, their
guardian, with a blow of his large claws, swept away the boxes of sweets and put them into
his pocket, amid the laughs of his comrades. It was too late to make good the German’s
mischief, for the soldiers were already moving forward. The less injured limped quickly
away, a car drove the others to the station, into which no civilian was allowed to penetrate,
and after many salutations we watched them go to captivity with a sad heart.
<br><br>
Our visits to the county town were not all marked by such incidents. One day, Yvonne was
copying—in order not to lose a word—the official reports, in which we read: German victory
here, Prussian success there, Austrian army advancing this way, English forces retreating in
that one, and, believing nothing of it, she burst out laughing as she traced the news with her
ironical pencil. A stern-looking sergeant came up and announced:
<br><br>
“You not laugh, townspeople, all that true.”<b>[172]</b>
<br><br>
But we laughed all the same. Every one laughed at those reports, the sincerity of which was
doubtful, which appeared to us still more false than they were, and which yet were the only
threads which connected us with the rest of the world.
<br><br>
Fortunately, the benevolent Germans resolved to keep us informed of what was going on,
and published a weekly paper at Laon, the Journal de Guerre, which appeared for the first
time in November. The purpose of this publication, we were told, was to let the invaded
know the truth about the war. Oh! a German truth, of course, carefully dressed up, for their
self-respect prevents our enemy from showing us unveiled so indiscreet a person as Truth.
And the people laughed more than ever. They laughed from Sissonne to La Fère, from Anizy
to Marle. I must say that the newspaper was—according to us, if not to the
authors—ludicrous both in matter and manner. It was written in a language closely
connected with the French. With a knowledge of philology and some application you
managed to make out even the obscurest sentences. Thus, after a little practice, we succeeded
in reading the new idiom quite fluently, if we were still unable to appreciate its niceties.
<br><br>
The first number of this precious periodical<b>[173]</b> was a real poem. It was addressed to “the
high and chivalrous sentiments of the true French nation.” Its authors did not despair of
explaining to the French nation that its Government and its Allies had shamefully deceived it,
and hoped that it would soon see who was really responsible for the war, what humane and
disinterested part Germany had borne in the whole affair. In another article peace was openly
hinted at, and the author set forth the advantages which France would get if she listened to
reason, that is, if she abandoned the Allies and sided with gentle Germany. And then,
forgetful of all reserve, the Germans added that, in case of peace, the Government, far from
requiring a contribution of war, would probably be inclined to “build a bridge of gold to
France”—what a good promise we had there!—as Bismarck did in ‘66 to Austria. “It seemed
weakness,” the profound politician added; “it was strength.” If the learned members of the
German Universities had but attended a common school in France, they would have learned
that which our La Fontaine wrote: “If we force our talent, we shall do nothing with grace.”
Maybe they had understood that sweet manners are not congenial to their nature, that the
voice of the cannon alone suits their temper. We should not see them propose to France
with<b>[174]</b> bows and smiles the fate of vassal that Austria had accepted in ‘66. On the second
page, the Journal de Guerre magnified the capture of Antwerp, and described its
consequences in pompous phrases. Then the author of a small and acid article concerning the
relations of France and Russia concluded with this sentence, as witty as it is nicely turned:
<br><br>
“Varus, Varus, give me back my millions and my billions! If Russia listens to that! It is very
doubtful!” This is a literal translation.
<br><br>
Indeed, we laughed. Not a Homeric laugh, of course, stifled laughter maybe, a tittering rather
than a hearty laugh, a catching laugh which the enemy might have happened to overhear, a
real laugh all the same. We should have felt doubly prisoners if we had not made fun of our
jailers, and to be prisoners only once was quite sufficient.
<br><br>
As we knew German, we fell upon the papers we came across and bitterly enjoyed the high
praises they bestowed on their high deeds. They pleasantly jeered at the “parti-coloured
army” of the Allies, at the negroes who, according to them, “tremble with cold like a leaf
tossed by the wind,” which, the Prussian libellers added, must produce a bad effect in a
battle.
<br><br>
A number of <i>Simplicissimus</i> completed our<b>[175]</b> edification. The proud German Michael
was represented spitting his seven foes on his mighty sword. The Cossacks, bullying women
and children, turn up the whites of their eyes at the sight of a single Uhlan, and fall on their
knees. In Lorraine the German soldiers, by way of a change, leave off firing at the French:
“Let us keep a few of them to kill with bayonets,” they say. In conclusion, an Englishman
helps his little Japanese monkey up the noble oak-tree where the German eagle is perched:
“Go on,” he says, “try to pluck some feathers from his tail.”
<br><br>
<b>[176]</b>
<br><br>
<center>CHAPTER VIII</center>
<br><br>
The literature of the day, then, gave us little comfort. And every week the Journal de
Guerre played the very same tune. Yet about the end of November we read in its columns a
proclamation from the General-Governor of the place, which every one was bound to
acknowledge interesting, if not agreeable. This proclamation brought us the orders and
prohibitions of the almighty authorities.
<br><br>
“It is expressly forbidden to give assistance and shelter to French or Allied soldiers. Owners
of arms of all kinds, telegraphic and telephonic apparatus, and bicycles, are ordered to bring
them to the military authorities.
<br><br>
“It is expressly forbidden to keep live pigeons of any breed.
<br><br>
“It is expressly forbidden to go without passport from one place to another.”
<br><br>
The tyrant who issued the orders concluded with these words:<b>[177]</b>
<br><br>
“The population have nothing to dread as long as they submit to the laws of war and comply
with our orders.”
<br><br>
With our orders! With this you may go far, and they went very far.
<br><br>
The general regulations did not concern us nearly. Unfortunately we never met wounded or
straggling French soldiers; we possessed neither bicycles nor telephonic or telegraphic
apparatus; we owned no pigeons whatever, and we were content to assure our neighbours of
our sympathy, when, not without groanings and great sorrow, they slaughtered the
inhabitants of their dovecots. This massacre aimed at the suppression of all carrier-pigeons,
and in many farms the application had not waited for the law. At Mme. Lantois’, for instance,
an under-officer and two men had dropped in unawares, strangled and taken away as many
pigeons as they were able to carry.
<br><br>
“Don’t take the big white ones,” besought the farmer’s wife.
<br><br>
Naturally, the Germans are too wise not to be suspicious; those French people might be
cunning enough to disguise their carriers as big white feather-legged pigeons.
<br><br>
One night, old Leprince heard a noise in his out-house. Half undressed, he hastened out,
and<b>[178]</b> met face to face four soldiers, who in broken but energetic language ordered him
back to his mattress. The old man watched the intruders go away, went to his dovecot, and
by the light of his lantern saw the floor bespattered with blood and scattered all over with
pigeons’ heads.
<br><br>
But after the proclamation the slaughter surpassed any previous raids. It is easy to imagine
the emotion that spread among the cooing tribe, famous for their attachment to family
sentiments and home life. How many young ones just hatched were killed! How many loving
couples severed from one another! Bewildered, the poor things fled in bands throughout the
country, and made common cause with the crows, pecking corn in the fields. If a Prussian
happened to pass, he lifted his gun to his shoulder and fired at the white birds. If the
frightened flock sought refuge on a roof: “The deuce take the pigeons!” the angry peasant
cried out; “am I going to pay 1500 francs because two dozen birds have alighted on my
house?” Then stones were thrown and off went the birds. The order was explicit; for every
pigeon saved, the owner was subject to a fine of fifty francs. Therefore all dovecots were
shut up, and no one dared give asylum to the proscribed. The race of bicycles, also
persecuted, was equally bewildered. The<b>[179]</b> helpful bowels of the earth swallowed some of
them; the mouth of a well engulfed a few others. Some I know spent two months in a brook,
and then let themselves fall to little bits rather than serve the Germans. True patriots were the
bicycles. As to those which had not managed to escape the Germans’ attention, they were
taken to the mayor’s house, and clearly showed they were out of temper by grating, creaking,
gnashing the teeth of their wheels and screws the whole way long. This did not prevent the
invaders from using them on the spot with great satisfaction.
<br><br>
Of the regulations as to passports we had a proof before letters, so to say.
<br><br>
On a certain morning of November, Yvonne and Antoinette, attended by Pierrot, went to
Laon. For Yvonne a visit to the dentist was urgent; Pierrot wanted a Latin grammar. About
five in the evening we began to feel uneasy. The night and the fog fell in concert, and the
travellers had not yet returned. At half-past five Mme. Valaine and I ventured out, ready for
anything, and at two miles’ distance from the house we saw the little group, walking along
very fast, and with a candid air.
<br><br>
“Why, here you are! Frightened not to see us back? There was no reason at all!
Look,<b>[180]</b> we have got the Journal de Guerre, a pound of chocolate, and some sweets!”
<br><br>
We dined with a good appetite. Three days after we heard a loud ring of the bell, and two
German officers, attended by the Mayor, were shown in.
<br><br>
“The young ladies who lately were arrested at the level-crossing live here, don’t they?”
<br><br>
We looked at one another, struck with amazement. Yvonne and Antoinette alone seemed to
be acquainted with the circumstance, and modestly acknowledged they were the young ladies
in question.
<br><br>
“Well, they are to be at the Commander’s office in Laon at two o’clock. You need not be
afraid, thanks to the Mayor, the affair is already settled.”
<br><br>
At two o’clock! It was now past twelve. There was not a minute to lose. We were ready in an
instant, and on the way to Laon the offenders told the truth.
<br><br>
“Oh,” they said to me, “we have been so frightened! You know, we did not want to worry
mother, but you can imagine that we ourselves were terrified.”
<br><br>
“We were already late,” said Antoinette, “when at St. Marcel we discovered that we had lost
Colette’s ring. We went back to the town,<b>[181]</b> found the jewel half-crushed, and hastened
once more on the way home. It was about half-past four, the night was rapidly falling when
we got to the level-crossing.
<br><br>
“‘Passports!’ we heard.
<br><br>
“‘But we have none ... they have never been required.’
<br><br>
“‘Then go back to Laon, you are not allowed to pass.’
<br><br>
“‘Impossible! We have no house in Laon; my mother is expecting us at Morny.’
<br><br>
“‘Wait a minute,’ said a voice, and, riding on a bicycle, an officer, attended by two men, came
out of the fog. We explained the whole thing in our best German, for he did not speak French
at all. He was courteous, and seemed inclined to let us go, when he was struck by a sudden
idea:
<br><br>
“‘Are you English?’ he asked.
<br><br>
“Yvonne understood, ‘Do you speak English?’ and answered:
<br><br>
“‘Yes.’
<br><br>
“‘So, you are! Then you don’t go. Come into the house.’
<br><br>
“The soldiers gathered round and looked curiously at us. One of them carried a lantern,
which made all faces red. Our hearts beat violently.<b>[182]</b>
<br><br>
“‘Sir, please let us go home. We are not English ... my sister mistook your question.’
<br><br>
“You will explain this to me; come in first.”
<br><br>
“The door was thrown open; I stood on the threshold, when Yvonne caught my arm:
<br><br>
“‘Don’t go in, don’t go in!’
<br><br>
“I looked around me. We were alone among these ten men, whose looks seemed very strange
to me. Around us nothing but the lonely fields, the darkness, and the fog. In front of us a row
of untidy beds; on a broken-legged table a wretched lamp completed this picture of a
disreputable house.
<br><br>
“‘Oh no, I pray you, let us go away; let us return to Laon.’
<br><br>
“‘If you don’t come in, and quickly, I will shoot you.’
<br><br>
“And the officer snatched up his revolver.
<br><br>
“Out of despair we went in, the ten men pushed us and rushed in after us.
<br><br>
“‘You pack off post haste,’ the officer said.
<br><br>
“The soldiers disappeared, except one to guard the door.
“‘Well, you were wise to come in,’ said the officer, ‘or I would have ordered my men to fire at
you.’
<br><br>
“To exemplify his officer’s words, the facetious<b>[183]</b> guard pointed his revolver at us. Pierrot
chose that very moment to shriek with terror:
<br><br>
“‘Oh, I am so frightened, so frightened!’
<br><br>
“We were frightened too, I assure you; yet we did our best to comfort the poor boy. I
explained our case to our judge, and produced the twisted ring, the cause of our being late.
<br><br>
“‘We live in Morny, were born in Morny, our anxious family is waiting there for us. Here are
our papers; you see we are French students, and not English.’
<br><br>
“At last the interrogation was at an end. Pierrot’s tears were still falling fast when the
officer—a small, dark-haired, Roman-nosed nervous-looking man, more like a Meridional
than a German—allowed himself to be convinced.
<br><br>
“‘Well, I permit you to go on my own responsibility. It was a piece of good luck you met me
here, or you would not have reached your home. Never go out at nightfall without a passport.
Now go.’
<br><br>
“We had but waited for his permission, and were off as soon as it was given. Pierrot trotted
along, still shaken by his sobs.
<br><br>
“‘Poor Pierrot, no more crying, it is all over. Take this chocolate. But you know you are not
going to tell tales. You may have one sweet more. Don’t say a word of what you<b>[184]</b> have
seen. Mme. Valaine might be worried about it. Keep these cough lozenges, you will eat them
to-morrow.’
<br><br>
“He took the bribe, and, consoled in his mind, promised not to open his lips about the
adventure. So we came back with our heads high, and without a tremor in our voices.”
<br><br>
“You throw off the mask now! You had not relied on the solicitude of the Germans, who
wanted to know if you had come home safely.”
<br><br>
In Laon, the Mayor, red and merry, overflowing with fatness and self-importance, told us
simply that the thing was settled, as our declarations had proved true. He was sorry we had
been disturbed to no purpose. And we too. To walk for three hours at full speed in order to
listen to such rubbish! I shall be believed if I say that ever since then we never felt inclined to
travel without passport, which, besides, was soon afterwards strictly forbidden. The general
regulations were increased by rules peculiar to every village, differing slightly one from
another according to the local commandant. Those inflicted on Morny seemed to us the most
disagreeable. They saw the light one after the other. At any time of the day you might meet
the rural constable in the street, his drum by his side, a scrap of paper in his hand. He
looked<b>[185]</b> ashamed of his paltry function, being used by the military authorities to
announce to the world all kinds of nonsense.
<br><br>
“Order to stop all clocks and timepieces in all houses.”
<br><br>
Why? Who will ever pierce the mysteries of a German brain?
<br><br>
The kitchens of the farms seemed empty when the pendulums which for ages had animated
the rustic oak clock-cases suddenly stopped, when in the best bedrooms the shepherds and
shepherdesses who adorned the mantelpieces ceased their tick-tack. Yet in many a room a
discreet murmur survived, and the owner was ever on the look-out ready to stop the
unwonted noise if any search impended. Then came another commandant who did not care
for the order, and little by little the people made their clocks go as before.
<br><br>
“Order to bring to the Mairie—now called Commandature—one lamp out of every two.”
<br><br>
A selection was made, the best lamps were hidden, and the rest given to the invaders.
<br><br>
“It is forbidden to let dogs and cats go out.”
<br><br>
Poor pussy was astonished at the obstacles put in the way of her nocturnal adventures, and it
is said that every garden and field mouse danced three times in honour of the German
Emperor.<b>[186]</b>
<br><br>
But what seemed to us more ridiculous than anything was the latter part of this
announcement:
<br><br>
“It is forbidden to let the dogs go out; it is forbidden to let them bark.”
<br><br>
Who indeed had invented this fantastic order? Some old grumbler maybe, who was
prevented from sleeping by a loquacious bulldog, and as we had relapsed into feudalism, this
temporary lord thought that nothing should disturb him. I am surprised that he did not throw
blame upon the frogs in the neighbouring marshes. As our fathers, armed with poles, were
wont to beat the ditches by night, repeating, as they did it: “Peace, peace, you frogs, let his
Lordship sleep,” so their sons of to-day might have beaten the marshes, saying: “Peace,
peace, you frogs, let his German Lordship sleep.”
<br><br>
Prevent the dogs from barking! Really, now, we did our best, and for a few days, even for a
few nights, we nearly reduced them to silence. In our house, Gracieuse, a chatterbox by
nature, had a great many interviews with the cudgel, which worked well, and all about us the
nights were still. It was but the cannon’s turn to speak. In vain, for the moon appeared, white
and round and fascinating. Her four-legged admirers did not bay to her in chains. You may
imagine the poor animals, crouching down in their narrow<b>[187]</b> kennels, fastened with too
tight a chain and too tight a collar, lying squat in the dark, and thinking with terror of the new
and inexplicable severity, or casting a sly look at the whip or the broom which the master
snatched up if any sound came from their throats. This lasted about a fortnight. Then one
evening a pug-dog stirred up the others to mutiny by yelping furiously. The shepherd-dogs
followed, then the hounds. And the curs, plucking up courage, made their deep bass heard,
until at last, their muzzles lifted towards the sky, their mouths distended from ear to ear, the
whole canine tribe began to bay the moon.
<br><br>
“It is forbidden to go out after five o’clock in the evening and before six o’clock in the
morning.”
<br><br>
“It is forbidden to keep a light burning after eight o’clock in the evening.”
<br><br>
“How convenient it is!” moaned Mme. Lantois. “The dairymaid does not live at the farm, and
this will oblige us to milk the cows one hour earlier in the morning, one hour later in the
evening.”
<br><br>
But the dispensers of orders did not mind putting the farmers out, and every one had to
submit. We consoled ourselves for imprisonment in our houses for thirteen hours on end by
thinking that in case of a nocturnal incident, under every roof, from every
garret-window<b>[188]</b> would spring a head, with which one might exchange one’s impressions.
What was something more of a hardship was to veil our lights after eight o’clock in the
evening. Most of our neighbours go to bed shortly after the sun, but to townswomen as we
are it seemed impossible to sleep before eleven.
<br><br>
Our fruit, our crops, our wine were requisitioned; well, we understood why. But for mercy’s
sake leave us our evenings, for none can enjoy them if they are taken away from us. On
winter nights rooms are comfortable and warm, furniture friendly, and household gods
favourable. Ideas float in the air and may be turned into talk or dreams. I warrant, it is the
vigil of thinkers that has civilised the world.
<br><br>
In the morning everything has a cold air, inanimate objects are hostile, a dull light reluctantly
falls from the windows, and for some hours you strive hard to tame life again and make it
bearable. I beseech you, let me live in the evening. The Germans did not allow us to live in
the evening. More than once, when the bell had rung eight o’clock, we heard fists hammer on
the shutters, and harsh voices cry:
<br><br>
“Go to bed; French no light, no light.”
<br><br>
Yet it took some trouble to discover that we were not sitting in the dark. These people
had<b>[189]</b> to thrust their noses through the chinks of the wooden shutters to perceive that there
was no light in the room. The window-curtains not being sufficient to mask the light, we set
our wits to work in order to conceal it. Geneviève and I stuffed the shutters with two big
cloaks; Colette established a cleverly contrived screen all around her lamp, and Yvonne hung
up an extra blind. Every day, when the lamps were lit, one of us went out to supervise the
windows, while those within waited for information.
<br><br>
“Is my window all right?”
<br><br>
“At the top, on the left side, there is a tiny bright spot.... Good, now it is quite dark.”
<br><br>
“And in my room?”
<br><br>
“Just a small streak at the bottom.”
<br><br>
Into the smallest details of our life the Germans had managed to introduce something
vexatious.
<br><br>
Yet Morny being a quiet village, with a prudent Mayor at its head, we were not so much to
be pitied during the first months of the occupation. It might perhaps be thought that we were
too easily resigned to fate, that we yielded too readily to the enemy’s orders. Of course a
rebellion, followed by fearful punishment, would look well in a story. But to what purpose
should we attempt what would certainly bring new harsh measures upon our neighbours? Ah,
if the least of our<b>[190]</b> actions might have been useful to the country we were burning to
serve, how eagerly we—even the women—would have risked all to be helpful, and exposed
our lives, our liberty. But, alas, we were persuaded that we were helpless, useless, even of no
worth at all. We were mere ciphers, as unimportant to one army as to the other, just like
clods of earth in the fields! I know that a well-placed clod may cause a man to fall, and you
may be sure that when we found an opportunity we never failed to make a Prussian stumble.
But it would have been downright folly to think of an open rebellion, and we knew it well,
though we sometimes talked of it.
<br><br>
The German soldiers said:
<br><br>
“French women not bad; Belgian run after us with hay-forks.” Alas, what a price poor
Belgium paid for her heroism!
<br><br>
Soon after their arrival, the invaders took care to explain how they intended to be obeyed,
and to insist that the community would be responsible for all individual acts. The Hussars
were very near burning Chevregny while we were there, because some one—evidently one
of the French convoys escaped from the fight, and hidden in the wood—fired at a battalion
passing on the road. One man was wounded in the foot. Furious, the commander talked of
setting the whole village on<b>[191]</b> fire, and it escaped only because the priest proved that a
soldier had fired the gun and not one of his flock.
<br><br>
At Laon, a German soldier was killed by a civilian—in a brawl after drinking, French
witnesses said; while asleep, the German report declared. We have read the poster stuck up
in Laon. The end ran thus:
<br><br>
“The house where the crime was committed has been set on fire, and the guilty man will be
shot. If a similar deed occurs again, the quarter where it takes place will be burnt, and the
town condemned to pay a million francs.”
<br><br>
We did not require telling twice that it was not worth while. Bought one at a time, the
Prussians were really too expensive. An invaded country could not afford them at such a
price! Then all power of action had been taken away from us; we could but try to the utmost
of our power to save as much of our goods as possible, to set bounds, with cunning, which is
the arm of the weak, to the ravages of the scourge. If impotent anger often moved the women
into tears, what shall we say of the men? How shall we depict the fate of thousands of
soldiers ordered back home on the eve of the invasion? They are soldiers, they ought to fight
for their country. They watch from afar the different stages of the battle,
whose<b>[192]</b>manifold din reaches them. They stand, panting, with clenched fists. They think:
<br><br>
“This is going on, such a thing is happening. If I were with my brothers, I would fall upon
the enemy, I would fight against the invaders.”
<br><br>
Their blood is burning; they wish to kill; they will kill some of them. A sudden uproar,
imperious voices are heard. Be quick! Prussians are at the door. They are shown in, even
with a good grace. To refrain so long from murder, for which they would gladly have paid
with their life, more heroism was required from our men—the natural defenders of molested
women and famished children—than is necessary to rush headlong into the thickest of a
fight.
<br><br>
I have already spoken of the regulations the German authorities had decreed. But what is
impossible to explain, and what people can never understand who have not lived among the
invaders, is the way the laws were applied, and the thousand vexations that came from them.
We were constantly threatened with requisitions, inquisitions, perquisitions. We never saw
two soldiers walking together in the street without thinking: “Where are they going? What do
they want?”
<br><br>
Among those who were quartered in Morny during October, were a certain veterinary
surgeon<b>[193]</b>, pale-faced and red-haired, and a certain professor, red-nosed and dark-bearded,
both with gold spectacles. The excellent fellows spoke French as if they had been born in
Pontoise, obtruded themselves everywhere, and took a great interest in everything. They
talked cattle with the farmers, flour with the baker, provisions with the housewives, and
sweets with the urchins. They teased the young girls, and patted the dogs. After three weeks
of such dealings they knew Morny just as well as the elders of the place, knew your income,
your family affairs and secrets, better than you. They had a large share in the writing of a
guide for the use of the invaders, and when every inhabitant had been duly analysed, both
went away to their pleasant trade elsewhere. You may guess how useful this was for the
Germans, if you consider what an advantage it would be to leeches to understand anatomy,
and to know the disposition of the blood-vessels.
<br><br>
So much for inquisitions. As to requisitions, they were always going on, and the farmers
never got up at dawn without thinking: “What are they going to steal to-day?”
<br><br>
So we continued to hide as well as we could all that we possessed.
<br><br>
Think of our anxiety the day we heard they were said to search houses!<b>[194]</b>
<br><br>
One morning, about the end of November, the street was suddenly filled with soldiers. The
word “perquisition” was hovering over our heads. How anxious we were for the cheese and
butter we had the luck to get but the day before! If they happened to notice it they would be
sure to come back and fetch it. So we rushed into the garden, and with all possible speed
thrust the three pounds of butter and the five pieces of cheese, the hope of many a future
meal, into the box borders. Everything was ready. On our features was a mask of
carelessness. Then the bell rang; we opened the gate.
<br><br>
“Come in, gentlemen, and may it please Mercury, the god of the thieves, your patron, to let
you pass close to our hiding-places without discovering them!”
<br><br>
A soldier guarded the door. Two other ones came in with a sergeant. As the saint, so the altar.
From one room to another we followed the visitors. They were careful not to forget the
drawers, which their hands searched and researched. They disturbed the dresses hung in the
cupboards, to make sure that no French soldiers were hidden behind. They shook
the portières, to scare the carrier-pigeons away. “Ah! this bed-curtain is swollen ... a French
soldier ... the iron cross for me....” Flat down on his<b>[195]</b> face lay the knave. Alas! no feet
were to be seen beneath the curtain, nothing but the innocent frame of a picture forgotten
there three months ago. They went upstairs, took a careful survey of the attics, pried into the
heaps of logs. Then catching sight of the roof whose shadow served as a screen to our
bedding:
<br><br>
“What is up there, then?” asked the under-officer.
<br><br>
“Up there? It is an empty space between the roof and the ceiling.”
<br><br>
The man seemed satisfied with the explanation; the big boots got down again; they paused;
they had found nothing. At length they made up their minds to go out; they disappeared from
sight; they went to search the next house. A week after these operations the villagers still
talked about them.
<br><br>
“Has your house been carefully searched?”
<br><br>
“Oh, dear! dear! they have looked even into the saucepans!”
<br><br>
“They have gone through the papers in my desk.”
<br><br>
“They have climbed upon the beams of our roof.”
<br><br>
The visitors seldom found anything worth while—one or two pigeons which their owners
had hidden in the attic, and for which they had<b>[196]</b> to pay fifty francs each. Other villages
were less happy. For a trifle a man was considered suspect, and taken into custody. If a
cartridge happened to be discovered in a house, the owner was arrested and sent to Laon,
Hirson, or still farther off—and after the retreat of August what urchin had not a collection of
French and Belgian cartridges?
<br><br>
A gentleman-farmer of the neighbourhood was put into prison under the pretence that he
talked German too much! Another was arrested all of a sudden without any apparent reason.
<br><br>
“But why am I arrested?”
<br><br>
“Go on, you will know later.”
<br><br>
The poor wretch came back from Germany a year afterwards, ill, worn out, done for. Only
they had neglected to reveal to him why he had been imprisoned.
<br><br>
It is not difficult to imagine how these prisoners were hunted. A man was arrested in
Barenton. A gun had been found in his bed, it would seem. He was confined for a time at
Laon, managed to escape, and went right to Morny, where M. Dunard, his lifelong friend, hid
him in his house. Did any one betray the runaway’s retreat? I do not know, but two days after
his arrival an under-officer and four men came to M. Dunard’s, one from the street, the others
from the garden<b>[197]</b>, turned the farmer, his wife, and the maid out of doors, conscientiously
searched the house, found the fugitive, and took him away. We saw the poor man pass
between two gendarmes on horseback. He looked desperate; his hands, tied to one of the
stirrups, were quite blue. But immanent justice, dear to the Germans, had a watchful eye.
Here it was even imminent. A good citizen of Morny was just coming back from the forest,
with his donkey put to a cart, loaded with wood. The ass saw a procession, which he thought
unseemly, and proclaimed his opinion in the way usual to his kind. The horses, frightened by
the loud hee-haw, reared and fell back. A military motor-car which was approaching could
not stop in time, and gave a sudden lurch, followed by a general confusion. Horses,
gendarmes, donkey, cart, and logs fell topsy-turvy to the ground. Oh, the poor prisoner with
his tied-up hands! Well, he alone came off safe and sound. He alone, and the donkey of
course. Gendarmes, horses, and driver got up lame to the right and left, and more or less
injured. After some bandaging the Germans took their prisoner away all the same, but the
interlude had given a few minutes of intense joy to many people.
<br><br>
For a long time we were afraid that the men of<b>[198]</b> the village would be all taken away. We
knew that in many northern places the male population had been carried off to fill up
German prisons. When would they do the same in Morny?
<br><br>
“When the Germans withdraw,” was the general answer.
<br><br>
And the expectation of this day filled us with a mixture of joy and dread. The day came, and
the Germans did not withdraw. One morning all able-bodied men were summoned to the
“mairie.” They were taken in herds to Laon, and shut up in the citadel; for two nights they
slept on the floor and had to eat a nameless stew. On the third day of their absence, towards
evening, a joyful rumour spread in the village. “The men are coming back! the men are
coming back!”
<br><br>
Women and children rushed out to meet husbands, sons, and fathers, and the noisy troop
came back home, and stayed there.
<br><br>
We thought ourselves crushed with grief. What seemed to us most unbearable was the want
of news. Every family had one or several of its members away at the front, and we asked
over and over again, are they dead, wounded, ill?
<br><br>
And we knew no more of what happened in the invaded country, in Lille, St. Quentin, or
Rethel,<b>[199]</b> than of what happened in San Francisco, Paris, or Pekin. Every village was an
island carefully isolated from the rest of the world, and kept up very few relations with the
nearest towns. On the other hand, we can think only with compassion of the everlasting
threats hanging over our heads, of the uninterrupted plunder, of the vexatious measures,
which left us no rest. Yet all this was bearable compared with what we had still to support!
First the bad season was coming; soon we should suffer from the cold, since fuel was rare;
and even from hunger, since bread was scarce. One day Colette cried out: “Oh, mother, look!
Winter is coming; the Christmas roses are in bloom.” On the very same day we heard that the
village had a new commandant. Until then Morny had given hospitality but to convoys and
troops of the reserve. We should now have to deal with soldiers on active service. About a
hundred Death’s Head Hussars settled themselves in the big farm on the Laon road, and their
lieutenant became the supreme chief of the commune. The invaders certainly organised their
government. Every village was provided with a commandant, who grew more and more
powerful. You can imagine how these people were puffed up with pride. Just think of a
lieutenant, a small country<b>[200]</b> squire, owning beneath the sky of Pomerania three acres of
barren, unfruitful land, who all of a sudden sees himself absolute master of a rich territory of
1500 souls. It was enough to turn his head. Von Bernhausen was the name of the one we got.
He was of an historical family, and gave himself out to be a rich cattle-breeder. He was a
huge fellow—Geneviève and I reached to his waist—aged about twenty-six. Boldly cleft
from heels to chin, he bore on his interminable legs a kind of shortened bust, a gallows head
with small eyes, a little nose, still less forehead, a great deal of cheek, and still more of a
thick-lipped and ever damp mouth. This ugly lieutenant was a thorough glutton, and the
poultry-yards of Morny had many proofs of it. As he did not walk very upright, his coat,
which was always greasy, formed in front a mass of horizontal creases that might have
aroused the jealousy of an accordion. Two days after his arrival he was nicknamed Bouillot
for short, a diminutive of Crabouillot, which means in the patois “dirty.” Self-confident,
conscious of the rights his title and name gave him, this lordly personage went to Laon, or
received his superiors, without any change for the better in his dress. The peasants said he
was the cousin of the Emperor. We shall be more modest, and be content with
saying<b>[201]</b> that his forefathers are very well known in Germany and other countries. His
faults were overlooked in high quarters, and I leave you to imagine the benefit he reaped
from his post and the way he understood comfort, good cheer, and service. To begin with, he
requisitioned a capital cook of the place, and told her that she was to exert all her skill on
behalf of Germany. A salary was quite out of the question. Early in the morning he was often
to be seen in a poultry-yard, busy selecting his birds among the few geese, ducks, and fowls
that were still there, and then: “I want this to be at the farm at ten o’clock.” If the owner
timidly asked for a note of hand, the officer turned short round and shouted in his face: “I
told you to bring me this at ten o’clock.”
<br><br>
Once he came to M. Lantois and said: “I want the carriage you’ve got; bring it to me.” The
farmer, after a moment’s hesitation, dared to pronounce, too, the words “note of hand.”
<br><br>
“I shall give none; you don’t want any; your cart won’t get lost.”
Suddenly the man went into a regular rage, tore up and down the yard, uttered yells of anger,
and bellowed:
<br><br>
“I am the commandant of this village! I can<b>[202]</b> do everything I please! You must give me
all that I want!”
<br><br>
He took the carriage away, and two days later it was lying broken in a ditch.
<br><br>
Thus we had nothing to do but suffer these exactions. We had marched straight back towards
the Middle Ages. We were bondsmen, attached to the soil, as no one was allowed to leave
the land. The mighty and powerful lords had re-established all feudal rights. They took toll
for the shortest journeys, sold our own flour in common mills, from all men required villein
service. They were careful not to forget certain prerogatives, and thought they had a double
right to the favour of all women and girls, being at once lords and conquerors. Accordingly a
house like ours seemed to them especially created for the pleasure of the King of Prussia’s
officers.
<br><br>
And yet how careful we were to hide ourselves! From the moment that the hussars haunted
the country, Mme. Valaine did not allow us even to go and fetch the bread. The bakehouse
was deemed too far off, and the garden sufficient for exercise. Mme. Lantois’ farm, M.
Lonet’s house, a hundred yards to the right, a hundred yards to the left, were the longest
walks we were permitted to enjoy. And before risking our nose in the street we took a rapid
survey.<b>[203]</b>
<br><br>
“No Prussian is to be seen? Good, I will risk it.”
<br><br>
Despite these precautions, we were forced to receive frequent requisitioners or
perquisitioners, and we soon heard that the soldiers called our habitation “the house of the
pretty girls.”
<br><br>
Fatal name! No sooner had Lieutenant von Bernhausen heard it than he despatched to us his
second self, the sergeant Marquis, alias Sainte-Brute. For, as no one can doubt, Bouillot had
about him worthy followers—this sergeant, Sainte-Brute, as much dreaded as his master, and
a few other hussars, “he loved above all,” as Victor Hugo says. Was it “for their great
courage and their huge size”? I do not know, but for their ferocity in any case, their want of
scruple, their hatred of France. Among them he reckoned “the Blackguard,” a vicious lad
with a pink and white complexion; “Rabbit’s Paw,” who looked like a degenerate fool, with a
long bovine face; and the “Japanese,” whose slanting, spiteful eyes were always laughing.
<br><br>
One evening, when all the inhabitants of the village had locked up their houses, a loud ring
was heard at our gate. This made our hearts beat quickly.
<br><br>
“So late, O heavens! what do they want?”
<br><br>
We ran out, and soon showed in Sainte-Brute,<b>[204]</b> attended by two soldiers. Like a
conqueror he walked up the steps and entered the dining-room. He showed his best graces,
his small moustache was curled up, his cloak put on after the Spanish fashion, his cap
roguishly set on one side. A paper in his hands, he made a show of his fingers—he had
well-kept nails, I must acknowledge. Mme. Valaine, Geneviève, and I stood and waited. A
night-light illumined the scene.
<br><br>
“It is six o’clock,” the under-officer announced. “Everybody must be at home. I want to see
all the inhabitants of this house.”
<br><br>
Come along, then! Let him count us; set the family in a row; it is fair-day; the Germans are
amusing themselves!
<br><br>
The girls came in reluctantly with fury-flashing eyes.
<br><br>
Sainte-Brute thought the light too weak; he pointed his electric lamp at us, and one after
another scanned our hostile faces; then he declared:
<br><br>
“The ‘population’ say that you often go to Laon without passports.”
<br><br>
“If the population say so, it is lying. In the last ten days we have been but once to Laon, and
here is the passport you gave us yourself.”
<br><br>
“Hum, hum, the population....”
<br><br>
Sainte-Brute seemed to hesitate. The Blackguard plucked him by the sleeve:<b>[205]</b>
<br><br>
“Come, come....”
<br><br>
“Mind, you have had your warning,” the sergeant concluded by saying. “It is strictly
forbidden to travel without leave from the military authorities.”
<br><br>
Satisfied with his speech, the man withdrew. He took a careful survey of the lobby, opened
the kitchen door, cast his light in every direction. He seemed to take a great interest in the
copper of the saucepans. Yet he went out, followed by his acolytes. Their steps resounded in
the street. We bolted the door, and an hour after had not recovered from the emotion.
<br><br>
What was the meaning of this visit?
<br><br>
The next day, under the pretence that he wanted to see what lodging we might give to chance
soldiers, Bouillot himself came to see us with his train. At his heels was a big hound.
Percinet did not believe his eyes. A dog in his yard! He flung himself on the intruder; a
furious fight began; with his heavy boots the officer gave our poor collie many a hard kick,
and at length knocked him down.
<br><br>
“Brute!” cried Colette, in an indignant tone.
<br><br>
Herr von Bernhausen replied with a smile. He was kind enough to believe the epithet was
meant for the dog.
<br><br>
While Yvonne was taking away the poor<b>[206]</b> limping beast, the lieutenant asked a few
questions, then turned on his heels and went away. Once in the street, he lifted up his long
arms, as if to say:
<br><br>
“There is nothing to do in this house!”
<br><br>
He had pronounced our sentence; the reign of terror had begun.
<br><br>
Were I to live a hundred years I should never forget the weeks of mental torture I owe to the
Germans. Ten times a day terror sent all the blood of my veins to my heart, and made my
legs shake under me. Ten times a night terror awoke me panting from my sleep, with my
eyes swimming with tears.
<br><br>
Is any one coming in? Is there a knock at the door? Is the bell ringing?
<br><br>
For we had been officially chosen as butts, and at any time, under the most futile pretences,
two or three hussars, or a troop of them, used to enter the house. They well-nigh forced the
gate open, or broke the bell, and roaring out horribly one day required harness we never had,
another maintained they would find in our garden their horses broken loose. Then, at
nightfall, when our neighbours were all shut up in their houses, they would come back and
stay in front of the house. More than once they arrived drunk, and all the while they made a
frightful uproar, shouting,<b>[207]</b>calling after us, kicking in the gates, knocking at the shutters
with their revolvers, and trying to break them open. If from upstairs we asked what they
wanted, they answered with threats, insults, and invitations to come down.
<br><br>
This life was a very hell.
<br><br>
For weeks we kept a ladder raised against the wall so that if the soldiers, more intoxicated
than usual, managed to force a shutter open and entered the house we might escape. Thanks
to a small pent-house built on the other side of the wall, we could in a few steps be in Mme.
Lantois’ orchard.
<br><br>
The farmer’s wife had said to us:
<br><br>
“Do come in case of an emergency. The doors overlooking the garden are never locked, and
if you were pursued my husband and son would take a hay-fork to defend you.”
<br><br>
Colette, who now slept in the big room upstairs, had a hatchet nigh at hand.
<br><br>
“Oh,” she said, “if they got up to my room, I would split two or three heads before I jumped
out of the window!”

Of a certainty we had a very large share in the distribution of cares, yet the sun shone—or
rather the wind blew—for every one. It is useless to say that the hussars were prompt of hand,
and were not always satisfied with threats.<b>[208]</b> One day Lieutenant von Bernhausen had a
mind to go to Laon with his retinue. He sent for the Mayor of Morny:
<br><br>
“Make haste, I want three coaches put to at eleven o’clock. Be off!”
<br><br>
Bewildered, the Mayor hurried away to carry out the order. Where would he get three
coaches whose wheels would hold together, three horses whose legs would not shake under
them, whose backs would not be covered with bruises and scabs, when the farmers were all
eaten out of house and home? Besides, the less sorry jades were out in the fields at that time
of the day. By dint of researches and efforts, three decent coaches were got together at length.
But it was half-past eleven.
<br><br>
For thirteen minutes the commandant had been making the air echo with the thunder of his
wrath, and when he saw the Mayor red in the face and out of breath, he rushed towards him
with a stick, and vigorously beat the shoulders of the unfortunate magistrate.
<br><br>
Such is the proper way to deal with French people.
<br><br>
Let us be just. The following day the same Bernhausen dusted the jacket of one of his own
soldiers, who had ventured to kick a civilian. Yet it is worth remarking that the rascal did
not<b>[209]</b> get punished on account of the ill-usage inflicted on a defenceless person, but for
the insolence he had shown by encroaching on his superior’s rights. Gold lace alone
empowers you to distribute hard thumps and blows.
<br><br>
One farm on the Laon road, being in a conspicuous place, had to suffer particularly from the
plunderers and requisitioners who happened to pass by. One day Mme. Vialat could not
succeed even in giving her sick child something hot. As soon as anything was ready the
soldiers rushed forward, took it away, and laughed at the thought that they had played a nice
little trick.
<br><br>
There remained in the house a certain number of sheepskins, carefully prepared, and not less
carefully hidden. One day the hussars discovered and laid hold of the treasure. The farmer
lost his temper, and tried to defend his goods. Too many things had already been stolen; he
required a note of hand; but Sainte-Brute never gave notes of hand. Things were growing
bad; the farmer could not keep down his anger, and gave the plunderers a piece of his mind.
The soldiers threw themselves upon him; Mme. Vialat and her niece ran to the rescue.
<br><br>
“They might have killed him,” the young girl told us. “I came and stood before him.”
<br><br>
The brutes gave her a sound slap on the face,<b>[210]</b> struck her aunt with the butt-end of their
guns, and on their own private authority carried away the precious skins.
<br><br>
A young shopkeeper of the village, Mlle. Grellet, objected to a close search into her own
linen. The soldiers had no chance of success, as they were looking for a missing wheel. But
the sergeant pretended that no one dared withstand his will, and with a hoarse laugh he
rudely knocked the girl about.
<br><br>
Indignant, she struck him on the face. She was directly knocked down, her features
belaboured with clenched fists, and justice was demanded of the commandant. The poor girl
was immediately sentenced to three days’ imprisonment. We saw her taken to the “mairie,”
she was shaken with sobs, her bloody face all bruised and swollen. She was guilty of having
inflicted serious ill-treatment on the person of the rosy, smiling, and triumphant sergeant who
was accompanying her.
<br><br>
As to ourselves, the witnesses of these chivalrous deeds, we looked on, with our fists
clenched, with our teeth grinding, with tears of rage in our eyes ... and never uttered a word.
<br><br>
It was no use crying for help. Our very prayers seemed to rise to an unrelenting God, and we
could but murmur:<b>[211]</b>
<br><br>
“Father, Father, why hast Thou forsaken us?”
<br><br>
It was the reign of terror.
<br><br>
“Ah, Madam,” said a woman all in tears, whose husband owned a merry-go-round, “they
have just requisitioned our mechanical organ. Ah, Madam, such a beautiful ‘music,’ for
which we had given four thousand francs—all our savings! They have taken it to amuse
themselves. And how furious they were! When they are well spoken I don’t mind it so much,
but when they look so angry I tremble like a leaf.”
<br><br>
It was the reign of terror.
<br><br>
“When I see them coming,” another neighbour declared, “it makes my blood run cold.”
M. Lonet himself acknowledged that he never saw Prussians enter his house without an
inward thrill of fear.
<br><br>
“Whom will they harm to-day?” we thought. “People, animals, or things?”
<br><br>
It was the reign of terror.
<br><br>
When the invaders alarmed strong and courageous men, I, who am not a thunderbolt of war,
how could I put a good face on the matter? Geneviève, on the other hand, was more
indignant than frightened, but, as to myself, I was frightened to death.
<br><br>
It was the reign of terror, terror, terror. And<b>[212]</b> you do not understand the meaning of this,
you who have not rushed to your light to blow it out for fear its pale glimmer would betray
your presence, who have not stopped panting in the dark to listen to angry yells uttered close
to your windows, to hear your shutters shake and creak under the assailants’ blows—you who
have not realised that you are a woman and weak, and that a dozen brutes will seek more
than your life if they succeed in their design. You do not know what it is like, but we know it
from sad experience, and if the horrors that have overwhelmed other places have been spared
us, at least we have felt their envenomed breath, and our bodies and souls have not yet set
themselves free from the poison.
