He helped found the Mouvement Révolutionnaire Français (MRF) in 1943. An engineer by trade, Soulès joined the Jeunesses Socialistes in 1930 and later the Socialist Party (SFIO), where he became associated with the Trotskyist wing, the Gauche Révolutionnaire. In 1938 he moved to the Redressement, a pacifist group within the SFIO. <br><br> In 1939 he served with the French army and was captured and imprisoned in Elsterhorst in Silesia. There he converted to “idealistic” National Socialism and set up a Cercle Pétain, a political grouping of prisoners supporting Vichy. Released in March 1941, he joined Marcel Déat’s Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP). Soon he joined the MSR and, with André Mahé, wrote <i>La Fin du nihilisme</i>, attempting to define a doctrine for Vichy’s National Revolution. Rejecting communism, Soulès supported the ascendancy of a new elite to bring France into Europe’s New Order. In 1943 he broke with Deloncle, formed the MRF, and attempted to work with the Resistance. In 1946 Soulès won the Sainte-Beuve prize for <i>Heureux les pacifiques</i>, published under his pen name, Raymond Abellio. The following year he fled to Switzerland, returning later to live out his life in France. <br><br> R. Abellio, <i>Ma Dernière Mémoire</i>, 3 vol.

			case 2: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ABETZ, OTTO (1903–1958),</b> German ambassador in Paris from August 1940 to 1944, a supporter of Franco–German reconciliation, instrumental in attracting prominent French personalities to collaboration by means of flattery, sumptuous receptions at the German Embassy, and financial support. Early in life, Abetz was attracted by French culture. Starting in 1930, he helped organize Franco–German youth meetings, where in 1932 he met French journalist Jean Luchaire, whose secretary he married. Abetz became a member of the Nazi Party in 1937 and a specialist in French affairs. Suspected of espionage, he was expelled from France in 1939. <br><br> Abetz considered all forms of cultural life essential to restore a sense of normalcy in France when he arrived in the summer of 1940. He encouraged the reopening of theaters, music halls, and universities. He worked closely with Pierre Laval and Marcel Déat and obtained their release after Pétain dismissed Laval and had both men arrested in December 1940. On 5 January 1942, Abetz met with Hitler and Ribbentrop to attempt to form a Franco–German military alliance, which, however, failed. After the Allied landings in North Africa and the German occupation of the southern zone, Abetz was recalled to Berlin in December 1942 and requested to abandon all diplomatic action with France. Following an attempt by Pétain to recall the National Assembly, Abetz returned to Vichy in December 1943, the bearer of a letter from Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop reproaching Pétain for his “resistance” to the Germans and demanding the appointment of more dedicated collaborationists to the Vichy government. Following the liberation, Abetz accompanied the retreating Vichy supporters and collaborators to Sigmaringen, where he was finally dismissed as ambassador in December 1944. <br><br> Sentenced to 20 years’ hard labor by a Paris military court in 1949, Abetz was released 5 years later. He was killed in an automobile crash, which some have viewed as suspicious in origin, in 1958. <br><br> O. Abetz, <i>Das offene Probleme </i>(Cologne, 1951); O.
