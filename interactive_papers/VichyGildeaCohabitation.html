<i>In one of</i> the great classics of the Occupation, Vercors’s <i>Le Silence de la mer</i>,
finished in October 1941 and published by an underground press in Paris
early in 1942, a German officer, Werner von Ebrennac is billeted on a
French family comprising the narrator and a young woman, his niece. Each
evening, after his work at the local Kommandantur, the officer tries to
make conversation, saying how much he has always loved France, how
much French literature complements German music, how they should
unite as wife and husband, and how, as in <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, the love
of beautiful France will liberate the German from his beastly imprisonment
and reveal the handsome prince within. The niece, to whom these words
are subliminally directed, never raises her eyes from her sewing and never
speaks, the narrator continues to smoke his pipe, and the officer, confronted
by an unyielding silence, never sits down and soon withdraws with
the words, “Je vous souhaite une bonne nuit.” The story hinges on his visit
to Paris, where his friends are preparing the “wonderful union of our two
<b>(p.43)</b> peoples.” He returns, having met soldiers who experienced the horrors of
the Russ1an front and who have a totally different perspective on the
Franco-German relationship. He confides to the narrator and his niece 
that the soldiers laughed at his naïveté given the worldwide struggle for
power, pointing out that the real plan was not to seduce France but to
destroy it, body and soul, and ensure that she could never rise again,
“<i>Adieu</i>,” he declares and is gone the next morning, when silence descends 
on the narrator and his niece also.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a><br>
<br>
Fifty-five years later I visited Marinette Rameau in her oak-beamed
family home in the Angevin countryside close to the Loire. Born in 1909, 
she might be the same age as the niece in <i>Le Silence de la mer</i>. She is a tall
elegant, and still beautiful woman who not only kept a diary of her wartime
experiences but is happy to talk about them freely. She never married and
it is as if some of the most significant emotional moments of her life
occurred under the Occupation. This, for Marinette Rameau meant a
succession of German officers billeted on the family’s town house, in Angers
on the promenade facing the chateau across the Maine. The most memorable
of these officers was Captain Wilhelm Koester, who arrived on 21
July 1940. Whereas Werner von Ebrennac, asked by the narrator whether
he is descended from a French Protestant driven out by Louis XIV, regrets
that he is not, Wilhelm Koester declared, “I love to speak French. . . . I
admire your culture; my wife is of southern origin, her ancestors from
Vignolles [Charente] came to Germany after the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, but we are now Catholics.” Marinette’s mother proposed to
serve the officer in the study, but he insisted, “Madame, you do not understand.
I wish to eat at your table. Choose: do you prefer to have a civilized
officer or four soldiers who will be much less so?” Far from freezing him
out, the Rameau family acceded to Koester’s request. Marinette, whose
eyes were for handsome men rather than for sewing, was delighted. She
discovered that Koester, aged forty-seven, was a sculptor and director of
the Fine Art School at Trier. “I have to admit,” she wrote, “he is very
distinguished and perfectly educated.” His orderly, Willi Gehendges,
turned out to be his pupil at Trier. Marinette noted that he spoke little
French but played the violin “like a virtuoso, and by heart: Beethoven,
Schubert, Mozart, Strauss, Neapolitan romances, and modern tunes.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> Her
<b>(p.44)</b> only regret was that the captain and his orderly stayed for less than a month,
and when I interviewed her in 1996 she told me the whole story again,
rhapsodizing about the virtues of “le capitaine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a><br>
<br>
Marinette Rameau’s appreciation of the cultivation of the German military
was reinforced in May 1944 when “a French Apollo” turned up at the
house with an accommodation slip issued by the Kommandantur. Her
mother tried to turn him away, saying that her rooms were reserved for
Germans, but the Apollo was a leader of the French counterinsurgency
Milice (militia) and would not take no for an answer. A month later,
returning from the family retreat on the Loire, Marinette found vomit in
the garden, cigarette ends trodden into the stair carpet, wineglass stains on
the pedestal table, bullet holes in the bedroom walls, and two Milice fighters
still in bed. She complained to the Milice headquarters and then reprimanded
the uninvited lodgers. “I have to tell you, <i>Messieurs</i>,” she scolded,
“that we have had Germans throughout the war in the rooms that you
occupy. They were always clean and polite and would never have done
what I have just seen in the garden or left the doors wide open. It is painful
to me to observe that this is the behavior of French people. You ought to
be ashamed of yourselves.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a><br>
<br>
These stories of German officers billeted on French homes could
scarcely be more different. The difference lies not in the portrayal of the
officers, who are equally refined and civilized, but in the reaction of their
French hosts. The first was greeted by a persistent and glacial silence, the
second, if Marinette Rameau was as loquacious then as she is now, was
probably carried away on a torrent of words. One explanation may simply
be that not all families responded in the same way to their guests, but it
must be remembered that <i>Le Silence de la mer</i> is a political parable, a lesson
in patriotic behavior for the occupied French written as the initial goodwill
between French and Germans began to turn sour. It is a warning not to
trust to appearances, to beware of the mailed fist in the glove. Marinette
Rameau’s story may be the romantic daydreams of a thirty-one-year-old
spinster, but it is significant that her judgment was confirmed as the war
continued, as a result of the bad behavior not of the Germans but of the
French. Moreover, despite the official postwar orthodoxy that contact with the 
Germans was reprehensible, fifty years on she is still captivated by the
memory of Captain Koester. This is not to say that Vercors’s account is
<b>(p.45)</b> fiction and Rameau’s reality, but that relations between French and Germans
under the Occupation cannot be reduced to German oppression confronted 
by French patriotism. Despite the obvious inequality of power
between the parties, interactions between the two were multifaceted, subtle,
and complex. From Marinette Rameau’s account we understand that the
Germany of Goethe and Beethoven was never quite eclipsed for many
French people by the Germany of Hitler, that the clash of Latin and Teuton
was disturbed by Germans fluent in French and by Germans descended
from French stock, and finally that the German officer, cultivated and
honorable as well as virile, exercised a magnetic attraction, particularly over
French women.<br>
<br>
The experience of Marinette Rameau of a succession of Germans billeted
on the family home was not necessarily typical. The German Occupation
did not mean that the country was constantly teeming with troops
looking for accommodation. True, in the autumn of 1940 the German
military authorities required the French administration to undertake a sort
of Domesday Book of every village, to ascertain how many officers, NCOs,
troops, and horses could be accommodated in each commune, firstly under
ordinary billeting (one bed per soldier) and secondly under heavy billeting,
with the troops sleeping on straw. For Ligueil, a village of 2,028 near the
demarcation line in Touraine, for example, ordinary billeting meant 35
officers, 71 NCOs, 905 troops, and 247 horses, while heavy billeting meant
the same number of officers and NCOs but 2,258 troops and 428 horses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
In the event, fears of occupation on this scale were not realized. Unless
they were part of the military administration in larger centers, German
troops were generally on the move and never stayed long in one place. Most
small towns and villages were troubled for a few days or weeks at the beginning
and end of the Occupation and sometimes a little in between, but
rarely more. A historical survey undertaken on a commune-to-commune
basis in Maine-et-Loire (Anjou) in 1948 makes possible a fine calibration
of the German presence. In the Mauges, the village of Andrezé was occupied
between 21 and 23 June 1940 and 8 August and 8 November 194l,
when the troops moved into the unoccupied zone; no damage was reported.
The nearby village of Le Fuilet was occupied from 21 to 29 June and 14 to
25 July 1940. The mayor reported that the German forces occupied the
town hall, broke chairs, made holes in the wall, and removed flags and his
<b>(p.46)</b> scarf of office; when they returned in 1944, headlong in retreat, they stole
twenty bicycles. An analysis of over 200 reports received reveals that only 10
percent of communes in Anjou said that they were occupied throughout the
war, 15 percent were never occupied at all, and in between 26 percent were
occupied once, 29 percent twice, and 20 percent more than twice.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a><br>
<br>
Clearly, the impact of the German Occupation was very uneven. Cities,
ports, suburbs close to airfields, and administrative and communication
centers saw more Germans than out-of-the-way villages. For security reasons,
Germans were reluctant to stay in isolated farmsteads outside the
bourg, or village nucleus. Rural dwellings were not attractive because only
one room was generally heated, serving as both kitchen and living room
for the family. The mining village of Nyoiseau in rural north Anjou was
inspected three times as possible accommodation for German troops and
each time rejected as unsatisfactory. On the last occasion, early in 1944,
the secretary of the town hall told the German officer that “this is a mining
area and if your soldiers start drinking with them, it could turn nasty.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a>
Given the choice, German officers preferred elegant chateaux and seaside
villas. Well-connected politicians, industrialists, and generals were often
able to pull strings to avoid their properties being taken over. General
Huntziger, who had lost the battle of Sedan in June 1940 and now represented
France at the commission to oversee the armistice at Wiesbaden,
was able to keep his villa at the fashionable resort of La Baule out of
German hands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> But the ancient duke of Blacas, mayor of the pious and
picturesque town of Beaupréau in the Mauges, who had no such connections,
had to suffer three invasions of his chateau by German officers
between June and September 1940. Not only did he receive no notice, he
complained, and have to provide beds, sheets, washbasins, tables, chairs, a
typewriter, and a radio, but the Germans used up fifteen tons of his pure
Welsh anthracite, which would be impossible to replace for the winter,
given the British blockade.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> Maybe the cold finished him off, for he died
the following year.<br>
<br>
In the towns, the Germans requisitioned public buildings such as barracks,
convents, schools and halls and also took over the hotels. Busy
seagoing and trading cities like Nantes had giant hotels with up to 200
rooms, but the hotels 1n less commercial, more military and administrative
<b>(p.47)</b> centers like Angers were much more modest, with between 30 and 5O
rooms on average. This caused problems when Angers was chosen by the
Germans as the capital of its military administration for the whole of southwest
France. In the summer of 1940 there were 8,000 German soldiers in
the city, out of a total of 10,000 in the department. Although there were
four barracks that could house over 5,000 men, and convents and schools
could accommodate another 1,000--at least until the term began in
September--while châteaux for the general staff were plentiful in the
noble-ridden countryside, many officers and men still had to be billeted
“chez l’habitant,” as the French said.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> This meant not only large town
houses like that of the Rameau family but much more basic housing too,
of both middle- and working-class families.<br>
<br>
Some German lodgers, of course, were better than others. The Rameau
family’s first two lodgers had ugly dueling scars and drank Pommery champagne
by the case into the early hours. Marinette’s mother, who had the
room beneath them, was greatly relieved when they left after four days.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a>
Colonel de Sauvebeuf, who ran the charitable Secours National in Angers,
had four German soldiers billeted on his house near the château in August
1940. On the sixth night they brought home some “women of loose morals”
and made so much noise that he had to ask them to be quiet. It should
not be imagined, however, that the French had to suffer in silence. Regularly
they complained to the Feldkommandantur and were often obliged.
Sauvebeuf asked the Feldkommandantur to inform the soldiers that he kept
a “respectable house” and that they should behave with more decorum.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
Odette Goxe, whose middle-class family lived frugally in the predominantly
working-class neighborhood of Saint-Michel, received a mixed bag
of lodgers. The first officer, she recalls, looked like a pimp and spied in
cafés. She went to the Feldkommandantur to complain, and they removed
him. The second officer came back drunk and burst into the children’s
bedroom by mistake. As she left for the Kommandantur, the terrified officer
asked her not to say that he had had women back, or he would be sent
to the Russian front. The third officer, she subsequently learned. was the
director of the military prison at Angers and had a ferocious reputation.
At home, however, he was open and friendly, and asked her permission to 
take her children to the fair, where he spoiled them. On their return the
<b>(p.48)</b> youngest child was triumphant. “You see,” he proudly proclaimed, “he
didn't kill me!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a><br>
<br>
It may be that to seek redress successfully from the occupying authorities
was unusual, but the Germans, while keeping the French on a tight leash,
were keen initially not to alienate them unnecessarily. The harmonious
coexistence was facilitated by the attitude of Germans posted to France.
Many came as sexual and gastronomic tourists as much as soldiers. The
<i>douceur</i> of France and of parts of France like the Loire Valley in particular
was something to cherish. After the Russian front was opened up, the
alternative of service in France seemed like a dream, and even in comparison
with Germany, as the war progressed, France was seen as a land of
plenty. “<i>Leben wie Gott in Frankreich</i>” was a phrase much used by German
soldiers to sum up the ease of life in France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Lieutenant Helmut Voss,
before the war a municipal employee and a member of the Social Democratic
Party, now in charge of one of the Angers barracks, told of a soldier
who had shot himself rather than go to Russia and of the joy of troops
who learned that they were being posted back to France, especially after
the cold winter of 1941-42.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> Helmut Radssat came to Angers from the
Sudetenland early in 1944 and remained for five years, first in active service,
then as a POW. “France was the country for which many German soldiers
were nostalgic,” he recalled, “particularly those who had fought on the
Russian front.” They had a special affection for the canteen of the Verneau
barracks in Angers. “The precious aroma of wine and brandy was quite
new to me. In Germany such luxuries were becoming more and more
scarce. It was in those barracks that I learned to know and appreciate good
wines. We could also buy toiletries, lingerie for women, and so on. Things
that we had not been able to obtain in Germany for a long time, particularly
of that quality.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a><br>
<br>
Although the formal relationship between Germans and French was
that of occupier and occupied, there were other ways of defining the relationship.
Since the armistice Germans and French were no longer at war,
but the war continued around them and in one sense made them both its
victims. This was particularly true after the Russian campaign began to
take its toll. In addition, not all Germans in occupied France were soldiers.
Some were civilians, for example, builders and building workers employed
by me Todt Organization in defense work. One of the projects on the
<b>(p.49)</b> outskirts of Angers was the conversion of the château de Pignerolles into
a bunker-bound command center for naval activity in the Atlantic. The
lodger in the Rameau household in the autumn of 1942 was a Rhinelander
named Josef Liesenhof, a civilian whose Cologne building firm was working
on the château. Marinette Rameau noted in her diary that he was not
chauvinistic and asked her repeatedly “<i>Warum der Krieg?</i> I have nothing 
against you, so why should we be enemies?” And she replied, “<i>Ja, warum?</i>
I ask myself the same question.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> Two German workers involved in the
same project lodged for five or six months in the Leterme household, of
which the father was a quantity surveyor, using the bedroom of a daughter
who had just married and moved out. Michel Leterme, then aged twelve,
remembers that they were ordinary, decent men who drank coffee in the
kitchen and shared their cigarettes. In their rudimentary French their constant
refrain was “<i>La guerre, grosse malheur</i>."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a><br>
<br>
Michel Leterme’s father was a veteran of the 1914-18 war who, like
many graduates of the trenches, kept his helmet hanging up at home as a
badge of that confraternity. The confraternity, interestingly, existed not
only between French or Allied veterans but also between French and
German soldiers who, though they were supposed to be hereditary enemies,
had endured the same unspeakable experiences. Jacques Hervé, whose family
lived in Tours and went to Germany under the Service du Travail
Obligatoire (STO) in 1943, recalls that a café owner next door escaped
deportation to Germany after the intervention of a German soldier who
had been held a prisoner in Tours in 1918 and was eager to do a favor for
a fellow veteran.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> Bonds formed by military honor, which were stronger
than national animosity, went back a long way. Léon Mousseau, a country
doctor in Saint-Mathurin on the Loire, sent his wife and children to his
mother-in-law’s house in the Vend’e for safety. When a German officer
was billeted there, an old aunt took him to see the portraits and war decorations
of ancestors going back to the First Empire. The officer clicked
his heels and said, “Madame, I pay homage to our unfortunate adversaries!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a><br>
<br>
It is true that German respect for French military honor severely 
dented in 1940. The French soldiers of 1940 had not shown the same valor
as their fathers of 1914 and duly forfeited the esteem the German military 
showed for their equals. In the blitzkrieg of June 1940 the Germans were
<b>(p.50)</b> astounded by the absence of French resistance. “Where is the enemy?”
wrote a member of the Swabian division approaching the Loire. “On the
right a couple of men disappeared into the bushes. But of the enemy nothing
is to be seen. Where are the <i>poilus</i>?”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> We have already seen how the
German general who accepted the surrender of Saumur told the <i>procureur</i>
Louis Ancelin that the Germans respected the combatants of the last war,
who defeated them, but despised the little rabbits of 1940, who ran away.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a>
Helmut Voss observed that just as French men failed to do their duty so 
French women now showed their mettle. For him French women were
holding the country together, making their houses spotless in the morning,
but then doing themselves up in the afternoon to take a walk with their
children and husbands, who themselves seemed to do little other than hang
about on street corners and prop up the bar in cafés. The women, he said,
were defined by “intelligence, elegance of appearance and speech. After the
shock of the defeat they showed strength of will and energy and were able
to cope much more quickly than the men.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a><br>
<br>
For the German military this was not just a question of an appreciation
of French manners. They took the view that, by failing to defend their
homeland, French men had also forfeited the right to their womenfolk. It
was not that the conquerors assumed the right to rape the women of the
defeated nation, but the power to seduce was one of the fruits of victory.
French women, for their part, were equally fascinated by the <i>Übermenschen</i>
who had taken control of their country. A million and a half Frenchmen
were in German POW camps, leaving their women alone to fend for themselves.
German soldiers, by contrast, were surrounded by the aura of victory,
had the benefit of an artificially strong currency that enabled them to offer
French women stockings, jewelry, and drinks, and, according to one woman
from Touraine, “They were the best-looking men I have ever seen.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a><br>
<br>
The Occupation opened up many possibilities for relations between
French women and German men but this did not mean that there were
no rules. The German authorities forbade marriage between German soldiers
and the women of defeated nations, and Slavs working in Germany
who had sex with German women could be punished by death. The Germans
were also obsessed with the threat to their troops of venereal disease
and demanded that the French authorities keep prostitution under control.
<b>(p.51)</b> On the other hand, they regarded any interference by those authorities in
relations between German soldiers and French women as a slight to their
honor. The French had their own rules about what was proper in relations
between French women and German soldiers. To have sex was a challenge
to the French family, community, and country, but the rules that applied
at the Liberation, when “horizontal collaboration” was punished by head
shaving and possibly prosecution for intelligence with the enemy, were not
necessarily the same under the Occupation, when single women were coming
up against Germans in their employment and in social situations. The
1940 catechism of the socialist Jean Texcier, <i>Conseils à l’occupé</i>, which recommended
that the French be “correct” with the Germans but not friendly,
said nevertheless that French men should not refuse Germans a light or
interfere with a French girl negotiating business with a German soldier
who would get “only what he paid for.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a><br>
<br>
Some relationships between German soldiers and French women were
entirely bound by the codes of courtly love. Helmut Voss, for example, fell
in love with the French secretary of the German captain who was in charge
of the city of Angers. She was “a delightful young woman with sparkling
blue eyes, always beautifully dressed,” who, when he found an excuse to go
to her office each Saturday, greeted him with the words “Here comes Mr.
Faithful.” Once he ran into her at the theater, where she had gone with a
girlfriend, and was smitten by her “perfect manners, charm, friendliness,
and yet distance,” for obviously she did not want the relationship to
develop. Other relationships were less discreet and transgressed the boundaries
of the licit. Marinette Rameau tells of a German officer called Hubert
who used to visit the dentist’s wife in a white convertible, bringing her all
sorts of delicacies, such as game. The dentist’s surgery was on the second
floor of a block in Angers in which her father had the office of his veterinary
supply business. One day, coming out of the office where she was typing,
Marinette bumped into the dentist’s wife, “wearing white satin pajamas
and red shoes” in the arms of the German. Later, she said, the dentist’s
wife had a child who was “very blond” and was generally assumed to be
Hubert’s.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> Berthe Vaillant, wife of an official at the prefecture of tbe
Creuse, came to Ligueil, near the demarcation line, with her daughter
Denise in 1940 to look after her ninety-year-old mother. A few months
<b>(p.52)</b> later the German customs service established an office at Ligueil, and 
Denise, aged thirty-five, met a customs officer named Müller, who began to
come around to the house, singing in German as Berthe played the piano.
Then the recitals became parties and the parties feasts; German officers
started to come from as far as Tours and Châtellerault and the postmistress
and other local women joined in the celebrations, dancing with the officers.
Clearly they enjoyed spending time with well-bred officers who drove up
in large cars. Sometimes the officers stayed the night; as Berthe said, “I
never refused the Germans a room.” Caught by the Forces Françaises de
l’Intérieur (FFI) at the Liberation, Denise admitted having sex with Germans
and said she had fled the town for fear of having her head shaved.
Making meny with Germans was not well regarded in a small community,
and getting up too close was likely to attract accusations of treachery. The
postman and the doctor were among those who claimed that the dancing
women were all Gestapo informers and that the house was an “information
bureau” for the Germans. Berthe and Denise Vaillant went before the Cour
de Justice at Tours in December 1944. The charge of denunciation was
not proven, but Denise was sentenced to five years in prison for “relations
with the enemy.” What was regarded as a challenge to the integrity of the
community under the Occupation was seen as much more serious by the
courts at the Liberation, although rumor and gossip alone were not enough
to convict.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a><br>
<br>
Receiving Germans at home was frowned on more than meeting them
in bars, cafés, and restaurants. Relationships developed easily between waitresses,
barmaids, proprietresses, and Germans who were often regu1ar customers,
tended to drink a good deal, and tipped generously. Marie-Louise
Coiscault, who served in her parents’ bar, L’Artichaut, in the river-crossing
town of Chalonnes-sur-Loire, was nineteen when the Germans arrived in
1940. Among the daily customers, she became friendly with Corporal
Müller, from the Saarland. There is a photograph of her, her friend Jeanne,
and Müller in a meadow close to the town smiling at the camera, arms
linked. After Müller left Chalonnes, Marie-Louise sent him food packages
and supplied his German comrades who remained with eggs, meat, and
potatoes in return for soap and pâté. She wished to marry him after the
war and wrote to his family. Instead she was taken to court, where she
protested that she had not had relations with other German soldiers,
<b>(p.53)</b> although naturally she had been obliged to serve them and talk to them
when they came into the cafe. In spite of this she was deprived of her civic
rights for five years and required to live outside Chalonnes for a year.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a><br>
<br>
Sometimes during the Occupation itself members of the community 
complained that relations between French women and German soldiers 
were going too far. In March 1941 a group of French women were seen 
waving good-bye to a contingent of German soldiers leaving the railway
station of the seaside town of Le Croisic. The next day a notice went up
on the wall of the auction house listing the women who had “come to bid
fond farewells to the occupying troops.” They included the nineteen-year-old
daughter of the owner of the Au Bon Vin Nantais café, the proprietress
of the Café de Paris, and her barmaid, also nineteen. The local subprefect
who investigated the incident was more concerned with the act of denunciation
than with the leave-taking, and suspicion fell on a former railway
employee of Le Croisic station who was thought to bear a personal grudge.
The inquiry was inconclusive but suggests that in 1941 informing was
regarded as a greater threat to the fabric of the community than waving
good-bye to Germans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a><br>
<br>
Denunciation, from one perspective, was a patriotic act, bringing to the
attention of the authorities illegalities, disloyalties, and threats to the state
that might otherwise remain hidden. But it also represented a betrayal of
the secrets of the community, which were perhaps best kept from the prying
of the French state, let alone of the German authorities. Its magic was
that it gave extraordinary powers to the weaker members of the community,
in particular women, but its poison bitterly divided communities against
themselves. The peaceful town of Chinon was almost torn apart under the
Occupation by Madeleine Longuépée, a former dressmaker from a less
fashionable provincial town, middle-aged, childless, and divorced. Kept by
Adalbert Chevalier, the owner of the Café des Terrasses, who put up a
photograph of Hitler and a notice welcoming “our German friends,” she
became involved in his sideline of procuring French girls for the delight of
German officers who repaired to the cafe after a hard day giving orders at
the Kommandantur. One of these girls, Simone Peltier, aged fifteen, who
had sex with Gennans both in the bar and on a sofa in a cellar opposite,
had a quarrel with Chevalier and complained to the French gendarmerie.<br>
<br>
An inquiry into “the incitation of minors to debauchery” was launched
<b>(p.54)</b> by the examining magistrate, Leopold Florens, and the <i>procureur de la
République</i> at Chinon, M. Ponset, but it did not get far. Ponset and Florens 
were summoned to the Feldkommandantur in Tours in November 1940,
told that France had been defeated, and ordered to hand over all files
concerning immoral acts. Ponset affected to rule Chinon like a robed noble
of the eighteenth century and had declared, “I have the Kreiskommandant
[of Chinon] entirely in my hands, I can do with him exactly as I want, I
will continue to enforce French laws and ignore German ones and no one
will notice.” These words were relayed by Chevalier to the Germans, who
promptly arrested Ponset. For his part Ponset was convinced that Chevalier
was only doing as instructed by his mistress, Mme Longuépée, “the inspirer
of his deeds,” who had gone to pull strings with the German authorities
in Paris to ensure that Ponset was brought low.<br>
<br>
The Kreiskommandant of Chinon made clear that he had quite a different
notion of where power lay. He told Florens, who was also questioned,
that “we are the victors! You have been beaten! The women, even
the children of your country, are no longer yours! Our soldiers have the
right to have fun, and if you do anything to slight the honor of the German
army you will be arrested like M. Ponset. Chevalier and others are there
to keep an eye on you.” But Chevalier was putty in the hands of Mme
Longuépée. A year later he confessed to Florens that “all the evil comes
from that woman Longuépée. The woman is a tyrant. She subjugates me.
Listen, <i>Monsieur le juge</i>, it was she who had M. Ponset arrested. She went
to Paris to fix it.” Florens told the magistrate preparing Mme Longuépée’s
trial after the Liberation that he had never interviewed the woman, “but
she had the reputation of a shrew at Chinon, extremely dangerous for the
Resistance because of the contacts with the German milieux. Not because
of her charm but because of her diabolical intelligence and spirit of evi1.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a><br>
<br>
Mme Longuépée’s malice was not exhausted by the arrest of Ponset,
who was in fact released by the Germans after three weeks on condition
that be move to a post in unoccupied France. Around that time she was 
in Mme Gauthier’s grocery shop in Chinon when M. Bagarie, the postman,
came in. When Mme Gauthier asked for news of his son, Bagarie said that
the boy was delighted to be in the unoccupied zone, away from the Boches.
Mme Longuépée commented that the Germans were going to win the
war to which Bagarie replied that those who served them deserved to be
<b>(p.55)</b> shot one day. Bagarie was far from being a resistanct: he was a former
gendarme who sent his children to church school and sold large numbers
of photographs of Marshal Pétain to raise money for the charitable Secours
National. But Mme Longuépée was determined to lure him mto her trap.
She returned to the attack, defending Marshal Pétain’s policy of collaboration
with Germany. At this, Bagarie allegedly took a photograph of the
marshal and, making an appropriate gesture, announced that it was fit only
for toilet paper. His actions promptly reported by Mmes Longuépée and
Gauthier to the Feldkommandantur of Tours, Bagarie was hauled before
a German military court and sentenced to ten months in prison for insulting
both the German army and Marshal Pétain.<br><br>
When the post office investigated the case, they found that there was
more to it than a vendetta between Mme Longuépée and Bagarie. Bagarie
was a school friend of Ponset’s and Mme Longuépée, having got rid of
Ponset, wanted to get rid of his friends and allies as well. She was able to
enlist Mme Gauthier, the grocer, by blackmailing her. She knew that Mme
Gauthier had had an affair with a French officer in Saumur while her
husband had been away at the front in 1940 and that she had given birth
to a stillborn child. Mme Gauthier, for her part, was keen to have Bagarie
out of the way because her husband, who had a temporary job with the
post office, coveted Bagarie’s permanent one. The Germans were quite
happy to release Bagarie so long as Gauthier was given his job. But this
violation of administrative propriety was unacceptable to the French postal
service. As far as it was concerned, Bagarie was a good employee whose
southern temperament had got the better of him, while Gauthier was a
bad one. More importantly, to let two women of “deplorable morals” dictate
who was to be employed in the post office was out of the question.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a><br>
<br>
After a third incident in the space of five months, the French authorities
endeavored to recover control of the situation. Mme Josseaux, wife of the
bank manager of the Chinon branch of the Crédit Lyonnais, went into a
grocer’s shop in Chinon (we are not told if it was Mme Gauthiers) and 
met the cook of the Kreiskommandantur, who was buying fruit for her
German employers. “You can give them the pits,” observed Mme Josseaux 
wryly. “That is good enough for them.” Mme Josseaux was duly denounced
and arrested but at this point the subprefect, Paul Cay, had had enough.
He warned his opposite number, the Kreiskommandant, of the “deplorable
<b>(p.56)</b> effect that these arrests--based for the most part on the accounts of people
of the most dubious conduct and morality--may have on the population.”
He told the prefect more explicitly that the arrests were made after denunciations
by people accredited with the Kreiskommandantur. “Whether it
is Mme Longuépée of Porte du Château, Mme Gauth1er of rue Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, Mlle Crosnier of place Jeanne d'Arc, Mme Pichon and
her daughter of rue Marceau, Mme Albertini and her daughter of rue
Voltaire, Mlle Meunier of rue Marceau, Mlle Simone Peltier of les Closeaux,
Mme Mireille Beury of les Grésillons, both in Chinon commune,
Mme Galle at Beaumont, Mme Delory of the rue du Murier, their bearing
betrays without a doubt the mission that they are accomplishing.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> This
litany conveys a fear that although it was men who held public office, the
town was effectively being run by a mafia of women who exercised an
insidious influence at the Kreiskommandantur. The French authorities
tried to persuade the Germans, in the interest of orderly and hierarchical
administration, not to listen to women who through menial employment
or sex had come into contact with them. The Germans’ own concern with
order and hierarchy, it was hoped, would induce them to see eye to eye
with the French and terminate the reign of these females.<br>
<br>
After her break with Chevalier and Longuépée, Simone Peltier went to
live in a nearby hamlet with a member of the collaborationist Milice named
Crosnier and then terrorized the local inhabitants by threatening to have
anyone who crossed her arrested by the Germans. After the Liberation
Crosnier was found in a wood with his hands tied behind his back and two
bullets in the head in what turned out to be a settling of scores within the
Milice.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> Chevalier, Longuépée, and Peltier were arrested, interned, and
sent for trial. Two peasants and a grocer testified against Simone Peltier as
an immoral person addicted to the easy life and easy money, and she was
sentenced to three years for denunciation. At their own trials Chevalier
and Longuépée accused Peltier of lying about the scenes of debauchery
with Germans alleged to have gone on at the cafe. Longuépée admitted
that she had reported Bagarie for wiping his bottom with a photo of
Marshal Pétain but she denied that she had denounced people to the
Germans and argued that, on the contrary, she had used her contacts with
the Germans to save young men from being sent on forced labor service
to the Reich. Meanwhile Chevalier claimed that he had hidden three
<b>(p.57)</b> Jewish doctors who had been entrusted to him by his son-in-law in a
flat he owned in Paris. The Cour de Justice was not convinced: Peltier
was sentenced to three years in prison Longuépée to five, and Chevalier
to ten.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a><br>
<br>
The view of the Germans that as victorious soldiers they had first claim
on French women did not go unchallenged by French men, especially in
the rough and tumble of Saturday nights, when drink flowed freely. There
were particular hot spots like the port districts of Nantes and Saint-Nazaire
teeming with German soldiers and sailors whom French youths in gangs
were willing to take on. One fight in Nantes in September 1941, for
example, led to the wounding of two German soldiers and the arrest of
two Frenchmen, with both the French and German police involved. For
the French police chief this was not a question of the rights and wrongs
of sleeping with Germans but a matter of public order. In the little cafés
of the quai de la Fosse, where musicians played, and the square in front of
the Bourse, where a fair was often set up, “all the young people, male and
female, and soldiers, too, get together every night and particularly on Saturdays,
Sundays, and holidays,” he observed. “incidents often happen in
these places because of the mingling of males and females and above all
because of the abuse of alcohol.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a><br>
<br>
Between flirting, picking up girls, buying rounds, and paying for casual
sex, the lines were extremely fuzzy. Both French and German authorities
attempted to isolate prostitution from other relationships and regulate it
under well-established procedures for reasons of public health and public
order. But to control a range of sexual activity through regulations designed
for a well-defined category of prostitutes who were registered, kept in
brothels, and subjected to medical examination was extremely difficult.
Scarcely three weeks after the arrival of the Germans in Angers, the Kommandantur
instructed the local police chief to clamp down on what he
called the “covert prostitution” going on in hotels, cafés, bars, and even
private houses, where there were many “debauched women.” Inverting the
conventional balance of menace between occupiers and occupied, he
insisted that “these women who practice covert prostitution represent a
very great danger for German soldiers. . . . They are a veritable plague.”
Suspects, he said, should be arrested, medically examined, sent to the 
dispensary if they were found to be infected, and properly registered if they 
<b>(p.58)</b> admitted to being prostitutes; establishments that allowed such women to
ply their trade should be closed down. A sweep by the French police in
Angers discovered thirty-seven women in brothels, twenty-five registered
prostitutes working privately, and forty-one covert prostitutes, of whom
twelve were found to be contagious. Separate brothels were established for
Frenchmen and German soldiers, with an elite brothel for German officers.
Notices were posted in all brothels and in the homes of women working
privately to the effect that women were not allowed to attract clients from
windows or on the street and had to take at least one bath a week and that
German soldiers should use condoms and be issued cards with the name
and address of a contact who could be traced if they developed VD. The
clampdown did little, however, to minimize the problem: the number of
prostitutes discovered in Angers rose in the weeks before Christmas 1940
to sixty in brothels and sixty registered individuals, with ten covert workers,
and the number of covert workers suddenly rose again to thirty in February
1941.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a><br>
<br>
One problem with the regulation of prostitution was that the message
the Germans put out was ambivalent. They demanded action by the French
police to guard against the scourge of VD, but as a point of honor they
were reluctant to allow interference in the amorous pursuits of German
soldiers. In 1943, for example, an incident flared up in Cholet when Mlle
Denise Lacomme was officially registered as a prostitute by the French
police. This provoked her suitor, Karl Speyer, who oversaw the shoe industry
in the west of France for the purposes of the German war economy, to
burst into the police station to announce that her registration was “an
offense to the German army” and that he was going to “shoot all her lovers,
have all the officers who contributed to her registration imprisoned as
Gaullists, and put a bullet in the police inspector too.” The SS chief in
Angers, Hans-Dietrich Ernst, told regional prefect Roussillon to dismiss
the inspector in question for “anti-German activities.” The inspector was
summoned to the Feldkommandantur at Angers and told that Mlle
Lacomme would not undergo a medical examination. He expressed surprise,
since he had orders from the Feldkommandantur to clamp down on
clandestine prostitutes like Mlle Lacomme, an unemployed hairdresser
who plied her trade from the terrace of the Hotel Blanchard, opposite the
railway station. He had no idea why Speyer was so angry, given that he
<b>(p.59)</b> was “only one number on a long list.” For the French authorities it was 
intolerable that such a woman could make their police look ridiculous. The 
regional prefect stood firm and refused to dismiss the inspector. On his
side, Ernst realized that the German authorities also stood to look ridiculous
by hitching their honor to a such a dubious woman, and he withdrew
the dismissal order.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a><br>
<br>
As the Occupation wore on, it became more and more difficult to deal
with prostitution and the public-order issues associated with it. German
troops returning from the Russian front looked to have a good time in
France and did not take no for an answer. In the sleepy town of Ancenis,
on the banks of the Loire, soldiers who had done twenty-two months on
the eastern front had a particular fondness for the Au Bon Muscadet café
where they were “attracted more by the charms of Madame Dubillot [the
proprietress] than by the drinks.” Finding the café closed one evening, they
started firing their pistols. Two weeks later, finding the Stella brothel in
the town closed, they fired off more shots, wounding a fisherman in his
boat. The distraught mayor tried to convince the Kreiskommandant and
prefect to set up mixed patrols of French and German gendarmes to keep
a watch on such brothels, but even the Kreiskommandant had little authority
over troops who didn’t stay long in the area. Meanwhile a local doctor
who tended the wounded fisherman was concerned that the presence of
the Germans was driving up prostitution at an alarming rate: “minors, wives
of POWs, mothers of small children are causing a veritable scandal that is
having a disastrous effect on the morality of our young people.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a><br>
<br>
It was not only prostitution that blurred the lines of casual sex. The
Occupation created a multitude of menial jobs for women-as cleaners,
laundrywomen, bar staff, and waitresses in the <i>Soldatenheime</i>, or officers’
casinos--that often led to sexual relationships. In seaside resorts such as
La Baule, Pornichet, and Le Croisic, where many of the military and naval
forces working at Saint-Nazaire were housed in holiday villas, local girls
taken on formally as maids in the villas were willing to provide more generous
service.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> Slightly above the ruck, Simone Deflandre, a divorcée in
her early thirties who had been a nurse and masseuse, ran the Bar de la
Plage and supervised the maids who worked in the villas at La Baule; she
went out with a Captain Piel, a dental surgeon in civilian life who not only
wined and dined her in restaurants but also looked after her teeth.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a><br>
<br>
<b>(p.60)</b> Cohabitation between French and Germans was as much about money
as about sex. Obviously the Germans were in a position to plunder and
exploit the French economically. But just as personal encounters between
French and Germans were not just about rape but about patterns and codes
of love and sex, so also economic relations were constructed according to
certain norms and were not always to the disadvantage of the French.
Requisition was not the same as theft: a note was issued to the provider
that was redeemable, at least in theory, from the French or German authorities.
Neither did the Germans only take: leading sectors of the French
economy boomed under the Occupation because of German orders, while
Germans were always ready to pay handsomely on the black market for
scarce items or luxuries.<br>
<br>
Inevitably things were not always as ordered as this. Less than three
months after the armistice, the curé of Le Loroux, near the demarcation
line, sent an anguished letter to Marshal Pétain saying that since 24 June
the commune had been occupied by 210 Germans and 80 horses. The
German soldiers had taken over the schoolhouse, billeted themselves on
the inhabitants and in some cases driven them out, removed furniture from
houses, taken hay and straw for their horses and wood and groceries for
themselves, and performed military exercises in the beet fields. “Observe
the terms of the armistice?” he asked. “Permit German forces to respect
nothing, to take what families require for their own needs without the
permission of the French authorities, to steal whatever they want without
a requisition order, for the disgusting pleasure of reducing people to the
greatest misery?” An agricultural official from Tours went to the village to
see and reported back that there were now only eighty soldiers, that Germans
taking wood and coal was nothing unusual although perhaps they
might now gather hay and straw from other communes as well. He said
that nothing had in fact been taken without a requisition receipt’s being
issued, that “relations between the population and the troops were correct,”
and that for his part the mayor had not complained.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a><br>
<br>
Similar abuses went on in Nantes, where the Germans, having ruled
that all goods that had entered the port since 3 September 1939 were
legitimate war booty, confiscated stocks of tea, coffee, sugar, chocolate,
rice, and vegetable oil. Ordinary troops were more interested in consumer
goods and, waving blank requisition slips or indeed no slips at all, piled
<b>(p.61)</b> into the city’s department stores and according to the prefect, took “radios,
regrigerators, champagne, flowers, expensive antique or modern furniture,
carpets, drapes, luxurious dinner services, watches, chandeliers, bicycles,
cars, and even pleasure boats.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> He complained to Feldkommandant Karl
Hotz, and Hotz was prepared to rein in his subordinates if they went too
far. When a Luftwaffe officer took the car of the head of the women’s
teacher training college in Nantes on the grounds that “she did not like
Germans,” issuing a requisition note and then taking it back because it
compromised him, then dragging her to the Feldkommandantur and keeping
her waiting for two hours, Hotz “became crimson, as if he were going
to fly into a violent temper.” He declared that to take a car without issuing
a requisition note was theft and that no innocent person should be held in
the Kommandantur without his orders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a><br>
<br>
The French, who prided themselves on their Gallic cunning, found
many ways to get around the threat of requisition. Periodically, farmers
were required to take their horses to town so that the Germans could make
a selection. Odile Talon, a farmer’s daughter from outside Angers who
regularly went out with Germans and had influence with them, was able
to get some peasants who came to her exempted.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> Alternatively, tricking
the Germans served peasant self-interest and was later presented as patriotism.
René Bretault, from the Angevin village of La Pommeraye, recalls
that he took a twenty-five-year-old before the German commission and
was told, “Rauss!”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>Sometimes the trade in horses went in favor of the
locals. When the Germans arrived in Loire-Inferieure they noted that
horses were in short supply because in the previous year the <i>French</i> army
had requisitioned 8,800 of them, 50 percent more than the Germans would
have. Since they had an interest in getting the crops, not least to ensure
fodder, they actually lent their own military horses to French farmers for
the duration of the harvest.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a><br>
<br>
The Germans in general regarded France as a rich country but a backward
and unproductive one whose resources needed to be developed rationally
if exploitation on a long-term basis was to be a success. Helmut Voss
in Angers, compared France to “a beautiful older woman.” “The houses,
fields, and gardens,” he said, “are somewhat neglected, the whole seems
unplanned and disconnected, the technology is thirty years out of date and
makes us smile, the looks are seductive only from a certain distance.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>
<b>(p.62)</b> Shortly after he arrived in Angers, Feldkommandant Kloss called a meeting
of the prefect, his economic advisers, and a number of mayors and leading
producers to impress on them the need to increase productivity, in particular,
he made clear, the yield of the wheat harvest had to be increased the
following year by 25 percent. He emphasized that the proposed cooperation
was in deliberate contrast to the way the French had treated the Rhineland
when they occupied it in 1923. “The French authorities and economic
leaders,” he duly reported, “are quite ready to work according to the directives
of the military administration and to take and follow through the
necessary measures.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a><br>
<br>
One obsession of the German authorities was the amount of agricultural
land that lay fallow or abandoned. The French argued that productivity
was limited by the number of farmers held by the Germans as POWs, but
the Germans would not accept this explanation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> On one occasion they
demanded the dismissal of the director of agricultural services of Indre-et-Loire,
whom they saw as the tool of “the Jew Aaron,” former president of
the Chamber of Agriculture of Indre-et-Loire, for sabotaging their drive
to increase the wheat harvest.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> Another obsession was the plague of Colorado
beetles that infested the potato crops. Each June the Germans issued
instructions for the peasants to spray their crops and for children to be
taken out of school three days a week to collect and destroy the pests. In
July 1941 the Feldkommandantur of Loire-Inferieure complained that the
potato fields were still infested and demanded another campaign in August,
but the rural mayors replied that the children were on vacation and their
teachers gone and that the farmers did not want children in their fields anyway.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> 
A final obsession of the Germans was the infestation of rats in
slaughterhouses, tanneries, butcher shops, dairies, and even restaurants.
The chief veterinary officer in Tours, a Dr. Herbig, told the prefect that the
vermin were destroying food and fodder, propagating disease, and undermining
buildings; he ordered a program of destruction by traps and poison
in the summer of 1941. Unhappy with the result, he ordered a second
attempt in the fall.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> The Germans remained frustrated by the incompetence 
of the French and suspected that their foot-dragging was deliberate.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a><br>
<br>
The German authorities were concerned primarily with the economic
contribution the French could make but were also seduced by their artistic
<b>(p.63)</b> treasures. Of course the financial value of the treasures was important, but
there is evidence that the Germans could be better conservators than the
French. In the autumn of 1940, for example, Count Metterich, the head
of the army’s artistic conservation unit, visited Touraine with a delegation
of about twenty German museum directors and conservators to inspect its
historic buildings.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> He saw to it that the treasures of Versailles, which had
been moved for protection to the depository of Brissac, outside Angers,
received adequate supplies of scarce coal to ensure adequate heat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> A list
was drawn up of châteaux that for artistic reasons were not to be occupied
by German forces, including the châteaux of Chenonceaux, Villandry,
Ussé, Azay-le-Rideau, Langeais, Brissac, and Saumur.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a> After a visit to the
châteaux of Saumur, the subprefect complained to the mayor, much to
the amusement of the Kreiskommandant, that the windows were broken,
the collection was scattered, and the caretaker refused to show them around
because he said it was his day off.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a><br>
<br>
Even when military needs took precedence over art, the German
authorities were prepared to listen to arguments from the Ministry for
Industrial Production as to why certain statues of historic significance
should be preserved. Statues of Joan of Arc were generally protected, but
the statue of Rabelais at Chinon, whose ironic and subversive message did
not sit well with the conservative, moralistic tones of Vichy’s National
Revolution, was at risk. The statue was duly earmarked for removal early
in 1942 and Chinon was forced to present Rabelais in a new light in order
to hold on to him. The municipal council petitioned Marshal Pétain on
behalf of “the father of the French language . . . born in this region that he
loved so much and that inspired most of his works.” The minister for 
industrial production decided to recommend to the German authorities 
that Rabelais be permitted to stay on his pedestal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> The statues of the
nineteenth-century sculptor David d’Angers in Angers and the statue of
Balzac in Tours, however, were among those considered more useful as
German bullets than as monuments to French artistic pride.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a><br>
<br>
The contribution that France could make to the German war effort was
of course central, and it is clear that German production orders lifted the
French economy out of the recession into which it had been plunged after 
the defeat of 1940. War industries no longer had any purpose, the British
<b>(p.64)</b> imposed a blockade that caused severe shortages of coal and thus of 
electricity, and workers were laid off--first women, then men. In Loire-
Inférieure, the Germans calcualted calculated in August 1940 that a third of the 
workforce of 85,000 were unemployed.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> The Vichy government encouraged
local chambers of commerce to reduce unemployment by developing
programs to clear bomb damage, build local roads, or improve the water
supply, but it was paying a vast amount to Germany as reparation and
tribute under the armistice and had no funds available for Keynesian economics.
Orders from the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, and above all from
Kriegsmarine to sustain the war effort were the obvious alternative allowing
French firms to stay in business.<br>
<br>
The experience of the small town of Cholet may serve as an example.
As traditional economically as it was politically, it relied on two staple
industries, textiles and shoe manufacture; in the spring of 1941 its municipal
council was reduced to finding work for 150 unemployed men by
enlarging the cemetery.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> Then industries such as Radio-Électrique and
the armaments firm Société Alsatienne were relocated to Cholet from Paris
and German-annexed Alsace and were soon receiving German orders for
ships’ radios and pistols. So large was the market for supplying the armed
forces that even the traditional textile industry in Cholet was inundated
with orders for blackout material, carpeting, bed linens, and even handkerchiefs.
Similar enterprises in nearby towns also flourished. Bessonneau
of Angers employed 3,000 workers making ropes, sailcloth, and tarpaulin
and later diversified into nine-man tents and camouflage netting, while
Châteaubriant and Fougères produced snowshoes and army leathers for 
the Russian front.<br>
<br>
The demand for finished goods soon began to outstrip the availability
of labor and materials and the Germans adopted a policy of concentration,
closing down smaller and less efficient firms to allow the larger units to
develop. In February 1942 the Feldkommandantur of Tours presented the
prefect with a list of eleven firms, including a porcelain factory, a typewriter
factory, and the Mame print works that would have to close.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> Touraine
was also the location, however, of a number of advanced precision industries 
that expanded by virtue of military orders, such as the Société Générale
d’Optiques of Tours, Barbier-Bernard and Turenne of Amboise, which 
made field glasses, periscopes, and glass for headlights and searchlights,
<b>(p.65)</b> and the Compagnie des Cables, which made the cables crucial for military
communication in occupied Europe.<br>
<br>
The biggest contractors in the region were the shipyards, railway works,
and aircraft factories of the Nantes/Saint-Nazaire area. In Nantes were the
Chantiers de la Loire, the Chantiers de Bretagne, and the Chantiers Dubigeon;
in Saint-Nazaire the massive Chantiers et Ateliers Penhoët and
Chantiers de la Loire, both with over 3,000 workers. All these received
orders from November 1940 on to build destroyers, tugs, torpedo boats,
speedboats, U-boats, air-traffic-control boats, tankers, transport ships,
whalers, and trawlers. Associated engineering works received orders for
turbines and motors, steelworks for sheet metal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> Meanwhile in Nantes
the Compagnie Générale de Construction de Locomotives (Batignolles-Chatillon)
was devoting 90 percent of its output to the Reichsbahn early
in 1941, while the Société Nationale de Construction Aéronautique du
Sud-Ouest (SNCASO) at Nantes-Bouguenais accepted an order in April
1941 to build Heinkel 111 aircraft worth four million man-hours over two
years.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> From May 1942 there was a surge of orders not only from Heinkel
of Rostock but from Junkers of Magdeburg, Focke Wulf of Bremen, and
BMW aircraft motors of Munich.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a> To see that these orders were carried
out efficiently, the Germans set up a separate war-economy administration,
the Rüstungsinspektion, which patterned itself on the hierarchy of the
military administration. In 1942 the Rüstungsinspektion B (southwest
France), with responsibility for production in Maine-et-Loire, Indre-et-Loire,
Sarthe, Mayenne, and Ille-et-Vuaine (but not Loire-Inférieure), was
moved from Tours to Le Mans and placed under Korvettenkapitan Fock,
who was directly answerable to Paris. One of its goals was to increase the
number of Rüstungsbetriebe, or Rü-Betriebe, producing almost totally for
the German military, and of Vorzugsbetriebe, or V-Betriebe, working partly
for it. By September 1942 there were forty-nine Rü-Betriebe in the Le
Mans region but a year earlier there had been thirty in Loire-Inférieure
alone, demonstrating its exceptional importance for the German military
machine.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> The workers in these factories generally enjoyed advantageoua
conditions, such as fuller rations than the average and protection from the
Germans’ periodic campaigns to recruit labor.<br>
<br>
The German military machine required not only the delivery of military
hardware but also enormous building projects such as the Atlantic Wall to
<b>(p.66)</b> fend off potential invasion and the construction of U-boat bases at Lorient
and Saint-Nazaire from which the campaign against Allied Atlantic convoys 
could be launched. These projects were promoted by the Todt Organization
and involved huge contracts with construction companies like the
Entreprise des Travaux Publics Dodin in Nantes, which themselves often
subcontracted to consortia such as the Nantes group of twenty-seven firms
set up in July 1943. After the war Henri Dodin and the director of the
consortium argued that initially he had refused contracts but the Germans
threatened to requisition his workforce and plant.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> But accept them they
did, using labor conscripted by the Todt Organization, which was often
employed under atrocious conditions. One man sent to build the submarine
base at Saint-Nazaire said that everything was geared to obtaining the
quickest possible results: the men worked from 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M.
alongside Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Czechs, Poles, Russians, and
Arabs and continued through air-raid warnings (for which no shelters were
provided anyway). The food was plentiful but bad, they slept on thin mattresses,
and hygiene was nonexistent. The workers were like civilian prisoners
with unspecified release dates, he said.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> Meanwhile the Entreprises
Dodin made a profit of between fifty and eighty million francs working on
German defenses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a><br>
<br>
There has been much debate as to how free employers were to work
for the Reich and whether “economic collaboration” should be considered
in the same way as other forms of collaboration. What employers said after
the war about having their arms twisted is difficult to weigh. In 1943,
according to the Rüstungskommando of Le Mans, the owner of a foundry
at Sainte-Jammes-sur-Sarthe initially refused an order to make 50,000 15.5
cm shells, but mainly because he thought his factory would promptly be
bombed by the Allies; he was soon induced to change his mind.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> The term
<i>survival collaboration</i> has been invented by historians to define working for
the Germans on pain of seeing one’s plant and/or labor requisitioned, but
these same historians argue that German orders were “the driving force of
the Frech economy” under the Occupation, accounting for up to 70 percent
and even 90 percent of firms’ orders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> The temptations, moreover,
were not confined to shipyards, engineering plants, and building enterprises.
The German war machine created a vast market not only for military
hardware and buildings but for food, drink, scrap metal, and luxuries. It
<b>(p.67)</b> imposed price restrictions and legislated against hoarding, but goods were
in such short supply and demand was so intense that even the Germans
were unable to prevent the flourishing of a black market and were even
instrumental in developing it. The French, meanwhile, were only too
delighted to procure wanted goods and sell them to the Germans at exorbitantprices.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a><br>
<br>
Those who profited included not only hardened speculators but ordinary
individuals with an eye for a good deal. Among the first, Roger Flamant
was well known in the La Baule area. Before the war he had had a
large textile dye works at Anor in the Nord, which he sold, taking off for
Morocco to make another fortune. During the war he became a property
developer in the resorts of La Baule and Le Pouliguen, buying up large
villas and dividing them into apartments for a postwar vacation business.
He was well connected with the German authorities, who sold him
materials from buildings they had demolished and even lent him trucks
to transport them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> At the other end of the spectrum was Raymond
Couturier, a mechanic and foreman at the SNCASO works at Château-Bougon,
who also ran a café called L'Envol. When the Germans arrived
he gave up his job at the aircraft factory to concentrate on his cafe, then
made a fortune hiring out horses and carts for the German air base at
Château-Bougon and supplying the Germans with black-market goods
in the bargain.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a><br>
<br>
Some speculators had their fingers in a number of pies. M. Maud, for
example, had a clandestine abattoir at Montreuil-Bellay in Anjou and 
delivered meat to the Germans billeted at the cavalry school of Saumur.
He also had a secret distillery that sold liquor to the Germans at 500 francs
per liter; he exported the rest by rail to Nancy. With his profits he obtained
supplies of sugar, copper, and bronze, which he sold to the Germans, and
did a trade in bicycles new and secondhand, hunting rifles that had been
left at the cavalry school, and small arms that had been abandoned by
British soldiers in 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> Other speculators were more specialized and
more organized. George Besson, a commercial traveler, was the head of a
trafficking ring that bought up wine from Touraine winegrowers for 
between eight and fifteen francs a bottle and sold it to German clients in
Paris for fifty-five francs. Equipped with passes issued by corrupt Germans,
the ring was able to send truckloads to the capital without being stopped
<b>(p.68)</b> by French or German authorities, and the five ringleaders were said to have 
made 1.5 million francs in three months.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a><br>
<br>
Occupied France was full of rags-to-riches stories along the lines of 
Jean Dutourd’s <i>Au Bon Beurre</i>. In the little village of Coueron, outside 
Nantes, Joseph Aubineau was a laborer in 1910. He worked for the Germans 
as a carpenter, then bought a cart, then a truck, and became a road 
hauler. He was said to have been involved in an “intense black-market 
trade with the Germans, supplying them with wine, pork, poultry, eggs, 
etc. . . . He was reputed to be the biggest trafficker in the region.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> In 
many ways it was impossible to cohabit with the Germans and not make 
money off them. Those who got into trouble at the Liberation were seen 
to have gone too far, in particular to have preferred German clients to local 
customers, or to have combined profit with sex. Mme Laurence Morandeau, 
who ran a café in the same village of Coueron, was accused of saying
that she preferred one German customer to twenty French ones and of
indulging with her daughter Suzanne in “veritable orgies” with Germans
while her husband took pictures of them with a camera stolen from work.
She denied the orgies as “pure invention” and stated baldly, “I did like all
traders, I served Germans in my café because I had to, but I never collaborated
with them.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> One is inclined to believe her, and the thousands like
her who simply did business with the Germans because they were good
customers with money to spend. Some, like the Morandeau family, ended
up in court, but most got away with it and went on to make money out of
the next wave of foreigners. As one peasant joked, “During the Occupation
I worked for the Germans and now I am going to work for the Americans.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a><br>
<br>
The sullen rejection of the Germans represented by Vercors in <i>Le Silence
de la mer</i> has to be set against a more nuanced analysis of cohabitation
between French and Germans that held good at least for the first two years
of the Occupation. The image evoked by the historian Philippe Burrin of
the “blind town” refusing to make eye contact with the Germans was more
patriotic ideal than reality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> Beyond the power relations of French and
German authorities there were manifold private relations between French
and Germans that tended to revolve around money and sex. These relations
were not arbitrary but governed by rules negotiated between French and
Germans and among French people themselves. To receive Germans at
<b>(p.69)</b> home, for example, unless they were billeted, was felt to be different from
mingling with them in a public place under the public gaze. To accept 
German production orders openly was not the same thing as trafficking
with Germans on the black market. Very often the measure of what was
acceptable was its impact on the community: production orders might keep
the local economy afloat and people in work, whereas trafficking deprived
the locality of scarce resources. The impact of the Germans was not wholly
negative; naturally, they wished to exploit France’s resources to the full but
this sometimes entailed observing traditional practices and eliminating vermin
and pests. It has also been calculated that Germans did their bit to
tackle France’s demographic deficit by fathering between 50,000 and
70,000 children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> Perspectives also changed with time, so that practices
tolerated by communities weakened by evacuation and the absence of
POWs in 1940 were judged harshly in 1944 when communities were seeking
to rebuild themselves after the Liberation. Sexual misdemeanors were
punished more harshly than economic collaboration, partly because they
might be linked to intelligence of the enemy and the denunciation of compatriots,
partly because the threat to family, community, and male honor 
was felt to be much greater. The perspective of 1944 should not, however,
prevent us from remembering that in many respects occupied France was
another country where they did things differently.<br>
