			   <a href="image link" class"fancybox" ><img src="image link"></a> (this is lightbox)
			   Lightbox is a Javascript plugin to show images in a separate/larger window. 
			   Put the image URL in the double quotes. Do not use line breaks, THIS BREAKS THE CODE. <br> is fine.
			   
			   data-fancybox-group="gallery name"

	<p><b>[PAGE 35]</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Resistance</b></p><p><i>Internal and external</i><blockquote>Speaking in full knowledge of the facts, I ask you to believe me when I say that the cause of France is not lost.<br><br>De Gaulle<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></blockquote></p><p>The Resistance’, as a phrase, is a misnomer. There was not <i>one, singular</i> ‘resistance’; rather, and far more accurately, there were thousands of ‘resistances’, <i>plural</i>. This is just one of the myths surrounding the history of the Resistance that needs to be considered — and dispelled. Another is that the Resistance equated, simply, to de Gaulle.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> This is an entirely false contention—the Resistance was, and still is, a difficult and complex phenomenon to try to understand. Resistance activity was secretive and sometimes mysterious; hence, historians have often been thwarted in their efforts to locate, and comprehend, the true nature and essence of the French resistance.</p><p>At root there is one basic question: What actually counted as an act of resistance? The truth is that every resister had his or her own particular way of resisting. From jostling Germans in the street to full-scale sabotage, from non-communication with the occupiers to international military plotting, and from making an ostentatious show of the colours red, white and blue to guerrilla warfare, there were a whole host of different tactics.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> And in answer to the preliminary question, an act of resistance was, basically, anything that, in the mind of the person or group executing the act, <i>felt</i> like an act of resistance. This chapter will introduce, explain and analyse the phenomenon of resistance. The spotlight will move from the different types of resistance to the nature, make-up and ideology of resistance forces, the problems and obstacles that they faced and, finally, the question of success and achievement.</p><p><b>What was the French Resistance?</b></p><p>There are two key issues. First: what was the ‘story’ of the Resistance? And second: what <i>was</i> the Resistance? It is straightforward enough to sketch out the history of the Resistance. The Germans entered Paris on 14 June 1940 and four days later de Gaulle, broadcasting from London, uttered his famous words about the ‘flame of French resistance’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> In the 12 months following there were various signs of resistance activity including, most notably, a student protest in Paris, a miners’ strike in north-east France, and the birth of several anti-German newspapers. Bédarida argues that the Resistance had ‘more sympathisers than activists’ in 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> By 1941 the communists had joined the struggle and in 1942 the Secret Army—the name given to an amalgam of internal resistance militias—was formed. In 1943 the Maquis emerged as an important, and anarchic, terroristic force in the southern zone. Throughout that year efforts were made to unify the disparate anti-German, anti-Vichy forces by the formation of the MUR (<i>Mouvements Unis de la Resistance</i>) in January, the CNR (<i>Conseil National de la Resistance</i>) in May, and the CFLN (<i>Comité Français de Liberation Nationale</i>) in June. None were totally successful, but the de Gaulle-led CFLN emerged as a kind of government-in-waiting. Dreyfus in his history of the Resistance suggests that the various efforts at unification amounted to ‘<i>le grand tournant</i>’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> By the end of 1943, and throughout 1944, ‘mini-liberations’ were taking place all over France and by 26 August 1944 de Gaulle had entered Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> By 23 October 1944 de Gaulle’s <i>Gouvernement Provisoire de la Republic Française</i> (GPRF) had been recognised by the Allies. This was the Resistance story in brief.</p><p>What was the Resistance? Important clues to its identity may be found in the things that provoked people into resistance: patriotism, morality, instinct, revenge, the onward march of the German war machine.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> As to the general character of the Resistance, Kedward argues that if one was asked to illustrate the quintessential nature of the Resistance—its mindset and psyche—it would be more appropriate to quote a piece of evocative Resistance poetry than to refer to a political treatise.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> This is significant: the Resistance is depicted as a phenomenon that was only partly political. Overall, it was the search for an ‘ideal, mythical’ France rather than any particular sort of political solution or new constitutional framework.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> For Shennan the phenomenon was, in essence, ‘moral’ rather than ‘political’ and based first and foremost on a ‘patriotic reflex’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> for Levy it was ‘Very largely spontaneous’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> while for Ousby resistance was characterised primarily by a special ‘language’ and ‘rhetoric’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a></p><p>It could also be argued that ‘community’, or rather ‘sense of community’, was a vitally important part of the Resistance value-system.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Hawes might argue that resistance was the ‘individual solution’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>—and it is certainly true that the Resistance was comprised of individual men and women who had made their own personal ‘choice’—but we should not forget that the Resistance was also a shared vision. There were, obviously, frictions and divisions, but fundamentally it remained an alliance or coalition that, at times, developed into a genuine ‘community’. And, significantly, this was as true <i>after</i> the war as it was <i>during</i> it—with veterans associations and the like ensuring that the torch of the Resistance remained alight in the post-war years.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a></p><p>The ‘ideology’ of the Resistance—where it is possible to identify one at all—was only loose and fragmentary. In some places there was belief in ‘republicanism’; in others ‘revolution’. As Cady says though, there was ‘no one monolithic Resistance discourse’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> A general assumption has emerged to the effect that resistance values were of the left.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> It is difficult to argue with this assertion but there is also another view which says that, in reality, resistance values were not, actually, the converse of those of Vichy. This latter view stresses how the Resistance and Vichy embraced notions of authority, liberty and antiparliamentarianism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> This, obviously, is a contentious line of thinking. So is the argument put forward by Werth which claims that the motives of resisters were not always ‘pure’. He speculates that many people in the Resistance were ‘scared’ — and not <b>[PAGE 37]</b> particularly imbued with altruistic principles.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a></p><p>The Resistance was, in addition, about justice. In the early days it was about the right of French people to assert their self-determination and to take part in a fight for the survival of their country. Later it evolved into the quest for liberation—or, rather, the quest for a French-sponsored, and not an American-sponsored, liberation. By the end of the conflict it was about the settling of scores, about ad-hoc ‘justice’ and about locating, and then dealing with, a suitable number of scape-goats. ‘A shot. Justice is done’: this is how Lottman describes the process.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a></p><p>So, ‘complex, confused, under-explored and unexplorable’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> the Resistance is an intriguing phenomenon. It was a community, yes, but also, at the same time, a sociopolitical movement with mystical and spiritual overtones. Resisters came from all walks of life, they acted on different motivations and they originated from both north and south of the German-imposed zonal divide.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> The overall verdict must be that the Resistance was a ‘diffused and inchoate phenomenon’ which represented ‘a remarkable political and social mixture’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> There was incredible heterogeneity but, as Hawes points out, all ideological differences were to be put to one side until liberation was achieved.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a></p><p><b>Varieties of resistance</b></p><p>It could be argued that there were as many types of resistance as there were individual resisters.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Generally though, it is agreed that the most obvious sub-division occurs between ‘external’ and ‘internal’ resistance or between The Resistance of the Interior and the men of London’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> These two types are the most clear-cut and the types that will concern us for the greater part of this chapter. There are, however, other ways of thinking about resistance. For a start, one can differentiate between ‘active’ and ‘passive’ resistance. This distinction relates to strategy. One was overtly violent and ‘heroic’, embodied by movements like Free France and the Maquis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[2]</a> The other was altogether more personal and subtle. This form was described in <i>La Silence de la Mer</i>, one of the most important pieces of resistance literature.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> A German officer is billeted to live with a French couple—an uncle and his niece—but, as a mark of protest, the French people make a concerted effort not to communicate with him. The uncle, as narrator, states: <blockquote>The silence was unbroken, it grew closer and closer like the morning mist; it was thick and motionless. The immobility of my niece, and for that matter my own, made it even heavier, turned it to lead.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a></blockquote></p><p>On another level, it is possible to distinguish between the attitude of individuals and organisations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> Take the case of the Catholic Church and the Communist Party. With each there was a ‘corporate’ line; the reality though was that individuals within each organisation had enough freedom, on occasions, to act unilaterally and disavow the ‘agreed line’ (there are, for example, numerous documented instances of individual Catholics sheltering Jews).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a></p><p>Moving on, it is also clear that ordinary women—on their own and also as part of groups—played a significant role in the Resistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> Not for nothing is the Resistance, as a movement, often represented as a female or in female terms.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> Collins Weitz argues that women resisted in lots of different ways, not just in routine tasks, and claims that <b>[PAGE 38]</b> their general ‘self-effacement’ is the prime reason why their contribution to the Resistance has always been underestimated.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> Cady also states that women were at the heart of the ‘everyday battle’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a></p><p>The ‘everyday battle’ also consumed, and provoked, others. There was assassination and sabotage and direct action.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> There was also a typical lifestyle:</p><p><blockquote>[Being in the Resistance] demanded a particular psychological balance, which did not come naturally, to remain calm and apparently unconcerned while being continually on the look-out for the black Citröens and green fedoras favoured by the Gestapo. Nor were these all the security precautions required of a full-time<i> resistant</i>. Frenay [a Resistance leader] listed all the other habits which experience taught him to adopt: using not one but several <i>noms de guerre</i>…; carrying false identity papers and being ready to maintain his false identity if he were interrogated; constantly changing the places where he met <i>fellowrésistants</i>, forever checking to see if he was being followed and being ready to put on an overcoat or abandon a hat to alter the silhouette he presented; and keeping bolt-holes and retreats known only to himself.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a></blockquote></p><p>There was less ‘heroic’ behaviour too. Small, symbolic acts were commonplace: like jostling Germans in the street or passing on false and misleading directions to members of the occupying force. ‘Correct’ anti-German etiquette was actually formalised in <i>Conseils a l’occupé</i>, a special handbook of ‘ways to behave’ collated by Jean Texcier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> Resistance, of a highly-committed type, also took place in a range of varying social spheres: including intelligence, academia, art, and literature.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a></p><p>It should also be noted that resistance was very much conditional on geography. Clearly, in the northern zone, the German occupiers were the conspicuous enemy. In the unoccupied zone though—as Kedward notes—the forces of resistance identified other enemies: capitalists, clerics, anti-semites, police, state unionists.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> All of these people, to a greater or lesser extent, were closely associated with the regime of Pétain. Nevertheless, the fact remains that resistance was chameleon-like in its persona and its antagonisms. First and foremost, the Resistance was anti-German and anti-Vichy, but it also exhibited a multitude of related animosities.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a></p><p>So, the most obvious characteristic of the Resistance was its diversity. This, as Ousby notes, was possibly its greatest weakness and its greatest strength.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> The Resistance boasted a particularly mixed social base. Andrieu’s research suggests that artisans, small businessmen and students dominated the <i>Franc-Tireur</i> organisation, while employees were over-represented in the ranks of <i>Libération-Sud</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a> Levy mean-while argues that the Resistance was primarily ‘working class’ and ‘republican’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> Cole, however, concludes that all social classes were represented at the heart of the Resistance and he reminds us that six members of the wealthy du Granrut family ended up in concentration camps.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a></p><p><i>External resistance</i></p><p>The external resistance is, of course, the most celebrated form of resistance. The phrase relates to all those resisters who operated from outside France and, most famously, the type of anti-German, anti-Vichy activity associated with de Gaulle and ‘the Free French <b>[PAGE 39]</b> epic’, as Werth calls it.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> We must remember too that de Gaulle encouraged the growth of ‘support groups’ all over the world.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> De Gaulle was crucial to the Resistance, but we should not overestimate his importance. In this vein Levy argues that the Free French leader was only a ‘stimulus’: the people of France, he suggests, would have reacted anyway.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a></p><p>Even as late as May 1940, de Gaulle was an important figure in the French government, liaising with Reynaud and advancing his own personal views about France’s proposed military strategy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[n50]</a> He left France days before the Armistice and on 18 June, in his ‘prophetic’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> radio broadcast, stated: ‘The flame of resistance must not die.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> For this, de Gaulle was disciplined (<i>in absentia</i>) for desertion by the army. Never-theless it was the first signal that a group of French people were ready to fight back.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> As de Gaulle wrote later:</p><p><blockquote>I thought, in fact, that it would be the end of honour, unity and independence if it were to be admitted that, in this world war, only France had capitulated and that she had let the matter rest there. For in that case, whatever might be the issue of the conflict—whether the country, after decisive defeat, would one day be rid of the invader by foreign arms, or would remain enslaved—her self-disgust and the disgust she would inspire in others would poison her soul and her life for many generations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a></blockquote></p><p>The crusade would achieve its objective on 26 August 1944 when de Gaulle himself strolled down a liberated Champs d’Elysées as the new ‘republican monarch’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a></p><p>Throughout this four-year period, de Gaulle did not endear himself to others. He did not get on with the Allied leaders. Churchill and Roosevelt both viewed him as an arrogant upstart—and he was continually at odds with both. Even so, he was extremely effective in spreading the Free France message across the globe. In his memoirs, de Gaulle wrote:</p><p><blockquote>At the age of forty-nine I was entering upon adventure, like a man thrown by fate outside all terms of reference. It was nonetheless my duty, while taking the first steps in this unprecedented career, to make sure that no authority better qualified than mine was willing to step forward to bring France and the Empire back into the struggle…At this moment, the worst in her history, it was for me to assume the burden of France. But there is no France without a sword. To set up a fighting force was more important than anything. I began work on that at once.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a></blockquote></p><p>De Gaulle was thus both forceful and vain in his initial diagnosis of France’s problems and his future role. As Hartley has argued: The aim was to restore the independence and greatness of France; the means to this end would be a growing revulsion on the part of the French people at the shameful conditions of the armistice and an ever-increasing measure of resistance to German domination.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a></p><p>In essence, as Shennan argues, there were two main phases to the history of the external resistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a> The years 1940–42 can be termed the ‘London era’, with the Free France group based in the English capital.59 In this period de Gaulle viewed his <b>[PAGE 40]</b> movement as an ‘alternative France’. After the liberation of Algiers in 1942, de Gaulle moved to North Africa and posed as France’s leader-in-waiting: thus began the second phase of de Gaulle’s wartime activity.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> Significantly, de Gaulle’s Algiers-based ‘provisional government’—which ‘existed’ between May 1943 and March 1944— included two communist representatives. This was an extremely significant development: de Gaulle had bitten the bullet and, in the interests of resistance unity (and, possibly, much against his will), realised the need for a policy of inclusion.</p><p>Many books have been written about de Gaulle: his life, career and political philosophy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> It is important for us to grasp some basic points about his personality and his political role. For a start, we must realise that between 1940 and 1944 de Gaulle underwent two important evolutions. First, it is clear that he started the war as a soldier, but finished it as a politician. This was a vital and necessary change that emphasised how far de Gaulle had travelled, career-wise, in four years. Suddenly he was having to adapt to the realities of political life and the demands that this made on him (although his military background continued to condition his political attitudes and behaviour for the rest of his life).</p><p>Second, it would be fair to say that, as the war went on, de Gaulle’s politics changed. In 1940, as one would expect of a career soldier, de Gaulle was a conservative; one might even describe him as an authoritarian, an anti-republican and a reactionary. By 1944, however, a significant radicalisation had taken place in his attitudes; and in his speeches and writings there was much more talk of change and a ‘new republic’. Jackson’s analysis shows that the tone of de Gaulle’s speeches began to change in 1942. Prior to this date his speeches rarely contained words like ‘democracy’ and ‘republic’; they were politically ‘neutral’ and aimed at gaining the widest possible support. Jackson claims though that after this date, de Gaulle’s speeches became more radical, as if adapting to the changed political circumstances and the urgent need to get left-wing groups ‘on board’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> Throughout, though, de Gaulle’s wartime rhetoric was infected by ‘a style of intransigent nationalism’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a></p><p>These two illustrations indicate how tactically aware de Gaulle had to be. He knew that he had to enter the realm of politics; he knew also that he had to adapt his message to gain maximum support. The corollary was that, in organisational terms, de Gaulle realised the need for unity and coordination between external and internal forces. For various reasons he had no love for the France-based resistance groups, but his realism and political awareness suggested to him that external-internal solidarity was, possibly, the vital prerequisite for liberation. It was as a result of this belief that de Gaulle sent Jean Moulin to mainland France as his personal ambassador. Moulin’s mission was simple: to unify the external and internal forces. This he helped to achieve with the formation of the <i>Conseil National de la Resistance</i> (CNR) in May 1943.</p><p>Appropriate tactics were also crucial in other areas. De Gaulle’s initial supposition was that the war would evolve into a world conflict involving Britain, the US and perhaps even the USSR. This was a different line of thinking to that advanced by Laval, whose basic assumption was that Germany would win the war. In the end, Laval was proved wrong and de Gaulle proved right. It is important to note that de Gaulle had a definite strategy; and that was to widen and broaden out the conflict. He actively wished for a world war rather than a more localised conflict: the Resistance, he argued, should think <b>[PAGE 41]</b> long-term and not just settle for a policy of killing Germans in the short-term.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a> In a similar vein, de Gaulle knew that the French Empire could be very useful to him. It was still ‘France’, and it was not totally loyal to the Vichy regime, and thus, had much potential.</p><p>It is also possible to identify other features of the political de Gaulle. It is clear first that, by nature, he was an autocrat. Of course he had close associates, who formed a small clique around him,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> but for the most part he was a dogmatic and fairly uncompromising leader; hence his many fall-outs with Allied leaders. It must also be said that he was a good and effective communicator—he specialised in high-sounding speeches and undercover radio broadcasts—and that there was something particularly vain and arrogant about his whole persona. In his war memoirs, for example, he talks continuously in the third person: a sure sign of self-importance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a></p><p>Second, the notion of ‘legitimacy’ must be considered. This word was ‘of some importance in the Gaullist vocabulary…In the eyes of de Gaulle and his adherents they themselves were the true heirs to France’s past—an inheritance forfeited by the Vichy government from the moment of Pétain’s demand for an armistice.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> So, while the Marshal was struggling to assert his credibility, and desperately seeking international diplomatic ‘approval’, the General was almost <i>assuming</i> that his movement had all the necessary legitimacy. He actually seemed to take it as read that his Free France movement <i>was</i> France; and also that his ‘provisional government’ would just walk into power when Germany was defeated. Bédarida actually claims that, in time, de Gaulle came to personify a ‘double legitimacy’: via the CNR he acquired both political <i>and</i> national credibility.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> For most of the time, there was an arrogance and belief that was, on the one hand, unattractive to onlookers <i>but</i>, on the other, hugely necessary to the overall success of the Resistance effort.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a></p><p>And it is in this sense that one must acknowledge the element of destiny and prophecy inherent in de Gaulle’s posturings. This is an extremely significant theme. Shennan argues that de Gaulle was a symbol of hope,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> but more than that perhaps, he viewed himself as <i>the</i> man of destiny. Of course he needed the help of others, and of course it made him unpopular, but it could be argued strongly that France urgently required a figurehead and talisman in a period of despondency and severe dislocation.</p><p><i>Internal resistance</i></p><p>The internal resistance, by contrast, was a more complicated and heterogeneous phenomenon. ‘Internal resistance’ is an umbrella term used to describe the collection of resistance groups operating from within France—whether in the occupied or unoccupied zone. The internal forces were, on the whole, far more anarchic, unorganised and factionridden than those operating from abroad. Furthermore, there was a distinctive left-wing character to most of the France-based groups.</p><p>It would be true to say that the internal resistance had a different personality north and south of the German-imposed ‘border’. In the occupied zone it was anti-German first and foremost. There were several key groups: <i>Libération-Nord</i>, <i>l’Organisation Civile et Militaire</i> and <i>Front National</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a></p><p>In the unoccupied zone resistance forces were up against the ultraconservative regime <b>[PAGE 42]</b> of Pétain and, thus, they developed a much more overtly left-wing programme, implicit in which was the belief that radical political change was desirable post-Liberation. In the south there were a host of important groups: <i>Combat</i>, <i>Libération-Sud</i>,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> and <i>Franc- Tireu</i>r.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> There were other groups of note—<i>Libérer et fédérer</i>, <i>Témoignage chrétien</i>, the Christian Democrats—but it was <i>Combat</i>, <i>Libération-Sud</i> and <i>Franc-Tireur</i> which had the highest profiles in the south.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a></p><p>Overall, we must acknowledge the massive diversity and serious incoherency of the France-based resistance groups. Larkin dwells on the unorthodox alliances that developed—among Catholics, communists and Gaullists, for example. It was this lack of unity that provoked several efforts at unification. In September 1942 the various military wings of the internal resistance groups were united under the aegis of the Secret Army; the MUR, meanwhile, attempted to unite northern and southern organisations, and received money and arms from London for its pains; and the CNR, established in May 1943, was particularly important because it encouraged Gaullists and communists to work together and was, as a result, recognised by Moscow -a crucial development.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a></p><p>In time, the fragmentary nature of the internal forces became less of an issue. Important efforts were made to increase the coherency, and thus the effectiveness, of the internal resistance and it is true that as the Communist Party and the Maquis came to dominate the anti-German, anti-Vichy crusade, the elements of division could be seen to be of less significance. Eventually the Communist Party and the Maquis did emerge as the two leading groups within the French resistance. They operated independently, and were actually quite suspicious of each other, but in reality they had much in common. Eventually they came together in the <i>Franc-Tireurs et Partisans Français</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a></p><p>The Communist Party had been a growing influence in France during the inter-war years. As a political formation it had been an integral part of the 1936 Popular Front government, but it was still relatively small by European standards (it had 72 deputies in 1936). The story of the communists during the war is one of compromises, ambiguity and profound political and ethical dilemmas. The first point to make is that the political activity of the <i>Parti Communiste Français</i> (PCF) was seriously compromised for the duration of the bizarre Nazi-Soviet pact of 24 August 1939. This Berlin-Moscow alliance meant that all communist parties in Europe had to stay ‘neutral’ and were forbidden from mounting any resistance activity at all. Indeed, in France—as elsewhere—the Communist Party, and its newspaper, <i>L’Humanité</i>, were actually banned on account of their ultrapragmatic alliance with Hitler.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a></p><p>The Nazi-Soviet pact may have been comprehensible when viewed in the most Machiavellian of terms—the USSR was not ready to fight; Germany wanted to carve up Poland with its new ‘ally’—but for communist parties around Europe (particularly the one in France) it gave rise to a massive moral and political conundrum. The PCF leadership rationalised the Berlin-Moscow understanding as ‘a peace pact’ but, as Cobban notes, the Communist Party eventually came to be portrayed as a ‘tacit ally’ of the Nazis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> Throughout the inter-war years the PCF had been at the vanguard of the antifascist struggle, particularly in 1934 and during the Popular Front years; thus, the 1939 alliance tossed it into ‘utter confusion’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> There was something quite tragic and psychologically traumatic about the political situation into which the Soviets’ alliance with Hitler had thrust their French brethren. Even so, many rank-and-file communists <b>[PAGE 43]</b> chose to ignore the political implications of the pact and <i>did</i> actually resist in the years 1939, 1940 and 1941. Knight cites a communist tract published on 10 July 1940: ‘The great hopes of national liberation lie in the people alone. It is only around the working class, with its confidence and courage, that a front can be built, for freedom, independence and national renaissance.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> This is clear evidence of individual French communists’ <i>real</i> attitude in the early period of the war. It remained a very serious offence for PCF members to go against the Moscow-imposed political line, but ‘illegal and dispersed as they were’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a> they still played a part in the anti-Nazi struggle.</p><p>Everything changed though with the Nazis’ invasion of the USSR in 1941.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> This military initiative suddenly ‘freed’ communists across Europe from their unpleasant political dilemma; Germany was now the foe and PCF members could now act in line with their consciences. The 1941 invasion allowed French communists to regain their ‘patriotic reputation’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a> not only this, but the movement swiftly evolved into the most influential resistance group. As a well organised and highly disciplined political party, the PCF already boasted a powerful underground network and so, in many ways, the party and its infrastructure was a huge asset for the internal resistance.</p><p>It could be argued that, during the years 1941–44, the communists became the fulcrum of the Resistance. The Germans and the Vichy authorities certainly viewed them as the most potent resistance group and, as a result of this contention, labelled them ‘bandits’ and ‘terrorists’. In the second half of the war, eight Central Committee members were shot dead by the Germans and half the staff on the party paper, <i>L’Humanité</i>, were also killed. This shows that the Germans took the PCF extremely seriously as a resistance force.</p><p>And for its part, and perhaps quite naturally, the Communist Party attempted to exaggerate its role. It tried to acquire all the key resistance posts and talked continually about ‘martyrs’ and the ‘revolutionary hope’ enshrined by the Resistance and, eventually they believed, by the Liberation. It also involved itself in some of the most unlikely of ‘alliances’—with Catholics during the war and with Gaullists after it. So, in tandem with ideological principle, there was also genuine pragmatism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a> There was also an overtly intellectual strain to the communists’ rhetoric; a really powerful belief that the PCF’s resistance could and should be viewed as part of the heroic French revolutionary tradition.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a></p><p>The Maquis on the other hand was an anarchic guerrilla-style movement which operated out of the south and was famed, primarily, for its unorthodox and often badly organised terror gangs. For Kedward it was an ‘alternative culture’ with an ‘unorthodox nature and revolutionary potential’, while for McMillan it was ‘the most dynamic element of the Secret Army’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> The most important thing that can be said about the Maquis is that, 60 years after the war, it is still a remarkably under-researched phenomenon and, thus, still difficult to understand fully.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a> It was a part of Frenay’s Secret Army, but beyond this there is not a lot of definite information, bar some quite general assumptions. It is Kedward who sums things up best. He writes that the history of the Maquis is Varied, diffuse…inpenetrable, opaque, secret at best, fictional at worst’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a></p><p>These qualifications are certainly necessary, but it is possible to sketch out some of the main characteristics of the Maquis. In French the word <i>maquis</i> means, ‘scrub, bush’, a definition which is both helpful and unhelpful. It does not define the word and the <b>[PAGE 44]</b> movement in terms that we would easily understand, but it does hint at one important feature of the phenomenon: its background and location.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a> Indeed, the first thing that should be understood about the Maquis is that it was based in the rural south and actually exploited the mountainous and forested landscape of this region to its advantage. If most resistance forces based themselves in the towns and cities of France, the Maquis— comprised to a large extent of peasants—made a positive virtue out of its fairly disorganised and secretive existence in the woods and valleys of the south. And, if the maquisards did not know what they were going to do next, the Vichy authorities and the Germans certainly would not be able to track or pre-empt their movements. This brilliant unpredictability and spontaneity was, without doubt, the most obvious characteristic of the Maquis.</p><p>The Maquis was loosely organised, strong in rural areas, and southern-based.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a> As to the total number of maquisards in France, there have been a whole array of estimates, ranging from 20–30,000 to 140–150,000. What we know with more accuracy is that maquisards grouped themselves together in small units to form a kind of elite, irregular army which specialised in sabotage—cutting railway lines and blowing up bridges. The best insight into the nature of the movement comes via a contemporary recruiting pamphlet cited by Ousby. It announces:</p><p><blockquote>Men who come to the Maquis to fight live badly, in precarious fashion, with food hard to find. They will be absolutely cut off from their families for the duration; the enemy does not apply the rules of war to them; they cannot be assured any pay; every effort will be made to help their families but it is impossible to give any guarantee in this matter; all correspondence is forbidden. Bring two shirts, two pairs of underpants, two pairs of woollen socks, a light sweater, a woollen blanket, an extra pair of shoes, shoelaces, needles, thread, buttons, safety pins, soap, a canteen, a knife and fork, a torch, a compass, a weapon if possible, and also a sleeping bag if possible. Wear a warm suit, a beret, a raincoat, a good pair of hobnailed boots.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a></blockquote></p><p>There was no typical maquisard. Often he was a peasant or a communist or even a foreign mercenary. It is fairly clear too, as Kedward notes, that there were two main types of guerrilla fighter: on the one hand, the genuine, principled maquisard; and on the other, the STO runaway caught in the crossfire of war who preferred the dangerous and unpredictable life of an anti-German terrorist to the hard labour of life in a Nazi work camp.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a> Burrin, for his part, contrasts the courage of the early maquisard with the pragmatism of the later ‘runaways’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a> In this sense, therefore, we should not overestimate the ideological commitment of the Maquis, because for many people it was, solely, a refuge from other less pleasant existences—primarily, working in Germany for the Nazis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a></p><p>It would be accurate to assert, in addition, that the Maquis operated as a separate entity—though always unpredictable—for no more than two and a half years. Groupings of maquisards appeared from 1942 onwards. By 1944 they were forming ‘free republics’, but they had also thrown in their lot with the <i>Forces Françaises de l’lntérieur</i> (FFI): an umbrella organisation which had regularised, and grouped together, a plethora of <b>[PAGE 45]</b> irregular military groups—the communist <i>Francs-Tireurs et Partisans Français</i> (FTPF), the secret armies and the Maquis—in the hope of masterminding a (relatively) smooth liberation process.</p><p>The way in which the Maquis was viewed ‘from outside’ is also interesting. Vichy and the German occupiers looked upon the maquisard forces as a dangerous irritant: they were ‘murderers’, ‘bandits’ and ‘outlaws’ and they were treated almost like Jews. The British and the Americans, on the other hand, were largely favourable and sympathetic to the Maquis. They armed the rural guerrilla forces with arms and money and, perhaps, felt more comfortable dealing with them than with the communists (generally viewed by the Allies as an overtly ideological and revolutionary element). The regular military forces within France also had very little truck with the maquisards: they were viewed, simply, as amateurish and unorganised.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> This impression was to gain ground through the wartime years and the Liberation period as the forces of the internal resistance started to dispense their own brand of ‘justice’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a></p><p>Thus, although the Maquis and the other internal resistance groups had the same enemies, and also shared some common beliefs, they were quite distinct as resistance forces. The obvious difference related to ideology; the Communist Party could never totally trust a movement (in the loose sense of the word) which did not share all elements of its dogma and ideology. So, there was always going to be a problem about political labels and tactics: many ‘professional’ military elements within the resistance ‘coalition’ were horrified and alienated by the ‘criminal’ and ‘anarchic’ behaviour of the maquisards. Bédarida talks about ‘insurmountable problems’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a></p><p>Initially, de Gaulle’s Free France grouping and the various move-ments of the internal resistance had very little in common in terms of tactics, organisation, ideology or expectations at the Liberation. Larkin claims that the internal forces had a ‘tenuous relationship’ with de Gaulle, but that this improved as a result of Moulin’s strategic mission to France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a> De Gaulle, anyway, had very little time for political parties and their specific agendas; he felt that intra-French division at the end of the war could actually benefit the US and enable the Allies to impose their will at the Liberation. So, basically, de Gaulle just wanted to manoeuvre the internal resistance as he wished; it could be useful to him, but only so long as it acquiesced to his leadership.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a></p><p>There was also a lack of understanding between internal and external forces. The internal groupings were extremely critical of those who had left France; this was viewed, somehow, as the easy option; and as a result, members of the Free France movement were viewed as ‘cowards’ and ‘deserters’. The external forces, meanwhile, were suspicious of the radicalism and political ideology of the France-based groups. De Gaulle was not only wary of left-wing ideas but tended to believe that he alone personified the anti-Vichy, anti-German crusade.</p><p>The truth is that in 1940 and 1941 there was a chasm separating the outlook of the internal groupings and that of the external elements—so much so that many people talked of the Free French/Fighting French as if they were in some way separate from the ‘Resistance’ (which they tended to equate to the internal resistance).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">[100]</a> Bédarida says that internal and external forces trod ‘divergent paths’: they were both motivated by the same fundamental conviction (that France was ‘eternal’) but differed in the way they conceived of the ‘struggle’ (de Gaulle believed in ‘classical military conflict’, whereas <b>[PAGE 46]</b> the France-based groups attached themselves to notions of ‘underground action and guerrilla conflict’.)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">[101]</a> The groups operating from within France also exhibited a powerful republicanism that often evolved into a belief in socialism and a desire for social revolution. As a conservative, de Gaulle found it hard to come to terms with this ideology. By 1942, however, he was embracing ‘revolutionary’ ideas—at least in his rhetoric—and by May 1943 he had helped to establish the CNR. And by 1944, the communists had come in from the cold. As Jackson says: ‘Securing communist support was a vital part of de Gaulle’s strategy.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[102]</a> So, by the end of the wartime period, necessity and the force of circumstance had brought external and internal forces into an alliance of sorts; unity and shared purpose was never very strong, but it was just strong enough to enable France to emerge out of the trauma of the Occupation.</p><p><b>Problems and obstacles</b></p><p>If one serious issue for the Resistance was ‘unification’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[103]</a> the other fundamental problem was its relationship with the Allies. It must be remembered that, during the wartime period, de Gaulle was in exile; he was in a desperate situation and relied for much of the time on the goodwill of his hosts, the British. He also tried to exploit the goodwill of the US but, in a rather rude and unappealing manner, seemed to <i>assume</i> that the Allies would help ‘rescue’ France. This was a big mistake.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that the Allies viewed de Gaulle as an unattractive personality; and whatever their supposed common interests, they did not get on. Even though Churchill recognised de Gaulle’s importance early on, and announced that the Free French leader had a’legal basis’, it is clear that the two men never really saw eye to eye. On one level Churchill admired de Gaulle and what he was trying to do, and at times he was able to offer de Gaulle some financial support and general back-up. For most of the time though, he loathed the arrogance of de Gaulle and would often make life difficult for him (for example, by stopping his BBC radio broadcasts). The Free France leader recognised the problem:</p><p><blockquote>It must be said that the British authorities did little to help our efforts. Certainly they had distributed a leaflet advising members of the French forces that they could choose between repatriation, joining General de Gaulle and serving in His Majesty’s forces. Certainly the instructions given by Churchill and the activities of Spears, whom the Prime Minister had made responsible for liaison between Free France and the British services, did sometimes succeed in vanquishing inertia or opposition. Certainly the Press, the wireless, many associations and countless individuals gave our enterprise a warm welcome. But the British High Command, which from one day to another expected the German offensive and perhaps invasion, was too much absorbed by its preparations to busy itself with a task which in its eyes was secondary.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[104]</a></blockquote></p><p>There was obviously a mutual fall-out. As Werth has written: ‘Though financially dependent on them, de Gaulle continued to be arrogant and ungracious to the British.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">[105]</a></p><p>The perspective of the US was very similar. Much to the chagrin of de Gaulle, the <b>[PAGE 47]</b> American government recognised the Vichy regime as the legitimate French authority. Roosevelt, in addition, seemed to think that de Gaulle was a potential dictator and irked him continually by calling his movement, ‘the so-called Free French’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">[106]</a> If de Gaulle was put out by this, he was weakened almost fatally by the Americans’ loyalty to Henri Giraud. After the liberation of Algiers in November 1942, the US was instrumental in planting a ‘French authority’ in Algiers which—deliberately—excluded de Gaulle. This was an amazingly explicit snub to de Gaulle, especially as Giraud was a neo-Pétainist (and thus symbolised the Americans’ loyalty to Vichy, and not the Free French, as the ‘legitimate France’). Eventually, after a lot of machinations, de Gaulle and Giraud became joint heads of the <i>Comité Français de Liberation Nationale</i> (CLN) in Algiers. Ultimately, de Gaulle gained sole control of the ‘provisional government’ and the fallout was that, at the end of the war and later in the post-war period, he would have very little trust in the US and, furthermore, would make every effort to move France closer to the USSR in diplomatic terms. As Beevor and Cooper put it, de Gaulle’s most pressing problem was not the internal resistance forces, but his relationship with the two Anglo- Saxon leaders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">[107]</a></p><p>The Resistance also faced serious problems in its dealings with the colonies. Here the assumption was that the Empire was as much part of France as the mainland. Thus, de Gaulle set his stall out to win over all of France’s colonies, but it wasn’t easy for him to implement his plans. In September 1940, for example, in Dakar, West Africa, Vichy personnel forced the Free France forces to retreat—a serious setback for de Gaulle in his first efforts to swing Africa behind the Resistance. In Syria too, de Gaulle came up against problems. In Spring 1941 an Anglo-Free France force gained a military victory, but Britain—rather arrogantly in de Gaulle’s opinion—tried to carve up the territory for herself. In the end Syria became French mandated territory under de Gaulle’s provisional authority—a not entirely ideal outcome.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-108">[108]</a> Else-where though, de Gaulle’s efforts bore more fruit. On 27 October 1940 he became the legitimate guarantor of Brazzaville (<i>Conseil de Défense de l’Émpire</i>) and in the period that followed he established his own ‘mini-empire’—taking in Chad, French Equatorial Africa and other parts of Central Africa.</p><p>Ironically—or perhaps predictably—the Liberation also brought problems, and ‘insults’, for de Gaulle. The fact of the matter was that Britain, the US and the USSR saw themselves as the key players in the Liberation. As such, they planned for an Allied Military Government of the Occupied Territories (AMGOT) to take power in post-war France and argued that ‘American military governors’ should be parachuted in to guarantee stability. In this sense, the Allies were ready to snub de Gaulle again. However, even though French forces played only a minor role in the 1944 Normandy landings (a marginal role that was, in effect, part of the Allies’ plan), de Gaulle was eventually able to manoeuvre himself, and his own personal ‘provisional government’, into power amid the emotion and uncertainty of the summer months. As Werth states: <blockquote>De Gaulle was worried by the military role that the French themselves were to play in the liberation of their country—both as soldiers and as the Home Resistance; by the necessity of having France administered by Frenchmen, and not by AMGOT after the unfortunate model of Italy; and by the problem of how <b>[PAGE 48]</b> the Home Resistance, once it had outlived its usefulness, could be made to conform with the requirements of that central authority which he was determined to create.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-109">[109]</a></blockquote></p><p>Thus, de Gaulle had plenty to concern himself with. Ultimately, the AMGOT authority was stillborn. To consolidate his position at the head of the newly-liberated nation, he devised a totally new republican infrastructure, which included commissioners of the republic, a consultative assembly, and a parliament body that would soon become a powerful symbol of post-war republicanism. Clearly, therefore, Shennan is correct to say that the Resistance and resistance activity stored up serious problems for the Liberation period.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-110">[110]</a></p><p><b>A movement of substance?</b></p><p>In evaluating the nature and essence of the French resistance, it must be acknowledged that there was never such a thing as ‘the Resistance’. Rather, what existed was an uneasy coalition of forces. Even though there was a common enemy—the German occupation force, with its accomplices at Vichy—each element in this ‘alliance’ had its own agenda and ideology.</p><p>Clearly, the Allies had a profound influence on events in 1944 and 1945, whatever de Gaulle said in later years. The Resistance in all its various forms had its triumphs and mini-triumphs, and definitely helped create a ‘new spirit’ in France,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-111">[111]</a> but the reality of the situation was that for most of the time the Resistance was nothing more than a useful irritant. Throughout the Resistance, organisation and structure was poor; and whatever genuinely heroic activity did take place, the truth is that in 1944 the Allied war effort was the decisive factor.</p><p>It is also interesting that two historians—Cady and Shennan—have identified some common links between the Resistance and Vichy. Cady talks about the way that some vocabulary was shared and Shennan argues that, in their different ways, both the Resistance and Vichy stressed notions of authority and liberty.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-">[112]</a> This general point is well made and persuasive to a point. However, the similarities in language and rhetoric must not be exaggerated. It is not easy either to agree with those historians, like Andrews,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-113">[113]</a> who have put forward the view that Resistance ‘success’ was nothing more than a ‘myth’. Of course it is easy to criticise the overall effectiveness of the Resistance but it is another thing entirely to say that it was a minor player in the history of occupied France. Dreyfus says that in military terms the significance of the Resistance was marginal. However, he also makes the point that there were many different dimensions to the Resistance: the anti-Germanism of the early years, the political militancy of the communists and the emphasis on espionage and intelligence, to name but three.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-114">[114]</a></p><p>Ousby sums things up nicely: ‘Though they might have been small in number, there were certainly <i>résistant</i>s in France from the start, and so there was resistance, which grew from insignificance to play a part in how the drama of the Occupation was acted out.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-115">[115]</a></p><p>Kedward, however, should be given the last word:</p><p><blockquote>The events of 1942–4 put Pétain back into the fallible world of politics from <b>[PAGE 49]</b> which the process of mythification had elevated him. Historians with a weakness for cyclical theories of history like to suggest that the vacuum created was filled with a new myth, the myth of the Resistance, and a new mythic figure, that of General de Gaulle. It is a tempting conclusion but a false one. Both Resistance history and Gaullism have been given an epic treatment which suggests a kind of myth-making, but no one who has seriously investigated the Resistance to Nazism, whether in France or elsewhere, finds it either easy or necessary to question its exceptional achievements. The history of Resistance may read excitingly as fiction. It reads even more effectively as fact.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-116">[116]</a></blockquote></p>
