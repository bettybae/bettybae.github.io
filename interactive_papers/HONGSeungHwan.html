[3] In early life, Pétain enrolled in the French Army in 1876 and went to the St Cyr Military Academy in 1887. [4] Petain was and infantry officer and considered a national military hero of World War I,[5] and took the position as vice premier of France in May, 1940, as one who would reinforce morale during the subsequent World War II when the French was suffering greatly under Nazi invasion. [6]</p><p>General Maxime Weygand was furious to see failure to meet the promised British support for the war, particularly at the unforeseen retreats and the failure to deploy the promised British fighter aircraft. Given from such context, he and Phillipe Petain concluded that the French military power was hopelessly inadequate to counter that of Nazi Germany’s. Correspondingly, Paul Reynaud, the then Prime Minister of France, also conveyed to Petain that it is desirable for an armistice to be sought. [7] In addition, The Great Britain contacted Petain on May 31 and explicitly threatened France with a blockade and bombardment of the French Ports if armistice was to be signed with the enemy. [8]</p><p><b>Charles de Gaulle</b>(22 November 1890 – 9 November 1970) was a French general and statesman who led the Free French Forces during World War II, who later succeeded as the first president of France from 1959 to 1969 after founding the French Fifth Republic in 1958.[9] He finished his studies at France’s top military academy, Saint-Cyr, and later served as a lieutenant in an infantry regiment under Philippe Petain, a colonel during the time.[10] Gaining momentum in his promotion, de Gaulle was appointed as the undersecretary for defense and war under Paul Reynaud, the Prime Minister. However, shortly afterwards, Reynaud was succeeded by Petain’s new government, who sought to collaborate with Nazi Germany to prevent more losses of French lives.[11] Being a nationalist, he refused to comply to Petain’s decision and fled to England with the support from Winston Churchill. There, he called for a resistance against German forces, and even organized soldiers from French colonies to join the fight in the side of allied troops.[12]</p><p><b>References</b><sup>1</sup>“Phillipe Petain,” World War II Database. http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=120.

Gen. Hans von Griffenberg wrote later, ‘but we did not think that the lessons of the 1812 campaign applied to us. We were fighting with modern means of transport and communication-we thought that the vastness of Russia could be overcome by rail and motor engine, telegraph wire and radio. We had absolute faith in the infallibility of Blitzkrieg.’” (144, from Murray, John, <i>The Retreat: Hitler’s First Defeat </i>[2009], p.6)<br><br>”Six German armies-1.9 million men, 14,000 guns, 1,000 tanks and 1,390 aircraft-participated in Hitler’s Operation Typhoon, the “decisive” assault on Moscow. Once more they swept forward, and once more the Russians suffered vast losses: eight Soviet armies reeled in the path of the offensive, many units broke, many more were cut off. Maj. Ivan Shabalin, a political officer struggling to lead a mass of stragglers out of an encircled pocket, wrote in his diary on 13 October, a few days before his death: ‘It is wet and cold and we are moving terribly slowly-all our vehicles are bogged down on the muddy roads ... More than fifty had to be aban- doned in ground that resembled a quagmire; about the same number are stuck fast in a nearby field. At 0600 the Germans opened fire on us-a continuous bombardment of artillery, mortars and heavy machine-guns- and it went on all day ... I cannot remember when I last slept properly.’” (157, from Murray, John, <i>The Retreat: Hitler’s First Defeat </i>[2009], p.52)<br><br>”Almost every man engaged on both sides in the battles of those days endured extraordinary experiences. Nikolai Redkin, a thirty-five-year- old infantryman, wrote to his wife on 23 October: ‘Hello, Zoya! I barely escaped death in the last battle. My chances of survival were one in a hundred, but I made it ... Imagine a party of soldiers surrounded on all sides by enemy tanks and forced against a 70-metre-wide stretch of riv- erbank. There was only one way out-jump in the river, or die. I jumped and swam. But the bank remained under heavy enemy fire. I had to sit in ice-cold autumn water for three hours, completely numb. When darkness fell the German tanks pulled back and I was picked up by collective farm- ers. They thawed me and cared for me. It took all of ten days for me to get back from the enemy’s rear areas to our lines. Now I am back with my unit and ready to fight. We shall have a brief rest now, then return to the battle. Damn us if we don’t make the Germans take the same bath as we had. We shall make them bath in snow until they die.’” (158, from Voiny, Pisma, <i>Ioshkar-Ola</i>[1995], 24-25)'); break;

Frenchmen !
</p>

<p>
At the request of Monsieur the President of the Republic, I am
assuming the direction of the government of France as of today. Sure of
the affection of our admirable army, which is fighting with a heroism
worthy of its long military traditions against an enemy that is superior in
numbers and in weapons, sure that it has fulfilled its duty to our allies by
its magnificent resistance, sure of the support of the combat veterans that
I have been so proud to command, sure of the confidence of the entire
French people, I make the gift of my person to France to mitigate her
misfortune.
</p>

<p>
In these painful times, I think of the unfortunate refugees who are
streaming along our roads totally stripped of all they own. I offer them
my compassion and my solicitude. It is with a breaking heart that I tell
you today that we must stop fighting.*
I have spoken with the enemy tonight to ask him if he is ready to seek
with us, among soldiers, after battle and with honor, the means of putting
an end to the hostilities.
</p>

<p>
May all French men and women group themselves around the
government that I will lead during these harsh trials and silence their
anguish in order to hear nothing but their faith in the country.
</p>

<p>
(*) This is the text that was spoken. At the suggestion of Paul
Baudouin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the sentence was rectified—
unnecessarily and awkwardly—as follows: “It is with a breaking heart
that I tell you today that we must try to stop fighting.”
</p>











<b>Charles de Gaulle, “Appeal of 18 June 1940” </b>

<p>
The leaders who, for many years, were at the head of French armies, have formed a
government. This government, alleging our armies to be undone, agreed with the enemy
to stop fighting. Of course, we were subdued by the mechanical, ground and air forces of
the enemy. Infinitely more than their number, it was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics
of the Germans which made us retreat. It was the tanks, the airplanes, the tactics of the
Germans that surprised our leaders to the point to bring them there where they are today.
</p>

<p>
But has the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is defeat final? No!
Believe me, I speak to you with full knowledge of the facts and tell you that nothing
is lost for France. The same means that overcame us can bring us to a day of victory. For
France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her.
She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can,
like England, use without limit the immense industry of United States.
</p>

<p>
This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not
finished by the battle of France. This war is a world war. All the faults, all the delays, all
the suffering, do not prevent there to be, in the world, all the necessary means to one day
crush our enemies. Vanquished today by mechanical force, we will be able to overcome
in the future by a superior mechanical force.
</p>

<p>
The destiny of the world is here. I, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the
officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who would come
there, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the special
workers of armament industries who are located in British territory or who would come
there, to put themselves in contact with me.
</p>

<p>
Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance not must not be extinguished
and will not be extinguished.
</p>

<b>Charles de Gaulle, “Appeal of 22 June 1940” </b>

<p>
The French government, having asked for an armistice, now knows the conditions
dictated by the enemy. It follows from these conditions that the French land, sea and air forces will be fully
demobilized, that our weapons will be handed over, that the French territory will be
completely occupied and that the French government will fall under the control of
Germany and Italy.
</p>

<p>
We can therefore say that this armistice will be not only a surrender but also
servitude.
However, many French do not accept the surrender nor the servitude for reasons that
are called honor, common sense, [and] the best interests of the country.
I say honor, because France is committed to only dismantle its arms with the
agreement of its allies.
As its allies continue the war, its government has no right to surrender to the enemy.
The Polish government, the Norwegian government, the Dutch government, the
Belgian Government, the Luxembourg government, although driven from their territory,
have understood their duty.
</p>

<p>
I say common sense, because it is absurd to consider the fight as lost.
Yes, we have suffered a great defeat.
A bad military system, the faults committed in the conduct of operations, the spirit of
abandonment of the government during these battles, have all made us lose the battle of
France.
But we still have a vast empire, an intact fleet, much gold.
We still have allies whose resources are immense and who dominate the seas.
We still have the huge potential of American industry.
The same conditions of war that made us fight five thousand aircraft and six
thousand tanks can give us tomorrow, victory with twenty thousand tanks and twenty
thousand planes.
</p>

<p>
I say the best interests of the country because this war is not a Franco-German war
that one battle could decide.
This war is a world war.
No one can predict if the people who are neutral today will remain so tomorrow.
Even the allies of Germany, will they always remain allies?
If the forces of freedom ultimately triumph over those of slavery, what would be the
fate of a France subject to the enemy be?
Honor, common sense, the best interests of the country order all free French to
continue fighting where they are and however they can.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, necessary to group wherever we can, the largest possible French force.
Anything that can be brought together of French military and the French arms
production capacity must be organized wherever they are.
I, General de Gaulle, I begin here, in England, this national task.
I invite all French military personnel of the army, navy and air force, I invite French
engineers and weapons scientists who are located in British territory or who could reach
this territory, to join me. I invite the leaders, soldiers, sailors, and airmen of French land,
sea, and air forces, where they are currently located, to get in touch with me. I invite all
the French who want to remain free to listen to me and follow me.
May France live free in honor and independence!
