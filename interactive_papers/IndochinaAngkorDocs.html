			case 198: $("div#commentary").html('<img src="http://bettybae.ncity.net/interactive_papers/img/MatsudaEmpireofLove.jpeg"><br><br>The territorial archives of French Polynesia are kept up a winding roadway in the hills of Tipaerui, a green valley whose summits overlook Papeete, Tahiti. Among the scores of registers, requisitions, and cartons filled with stamped, scripted orders and reports to bureaus and ministries remain references to a striking project that made its way into both French literature and administrative practice in the nineteenth century: the forging of an <b>Empire of Love</b> in the Pacific.<br><br><img src="http://bettybae.ncity.net/interactive_papers/img/MatsudaPapeete.jpg"><br><br>The following stories focus on the historical constitution--and constestation--of that project. The navigator Louis-Antoine de Bougainville famously set one of the narrative myths for Europe and the world in teh 1760s by reporting of his reception in matavai Bay, about ten kilometers from Tipaerui, "The canoes were filled with women, who in the charm of their features conceded nothing to most European females ... most of these nymphs were naked, for the men adn old women who were with them had taken off the loin-cloths which they usually wore." His enthusiastic tales purposefully underscored notions of sensuality and erotic attraction as constitutents of a French presence in the Pacific. These launched an exotic genre that never separated itself from reports of unpredictable, yet generous, local hosts and "island women" of ripe sensuality and easy sexual encounter.<br><br>Within two generations, Pacific encounters would be overwhelmingly colonial, coded in languages and practices of dominance and possession--yet no less amorously defined. The Tiparerui archives conserve instructions from nineteenth-century colonial commnanders to their station heads that illustrate this at the most local level. Notes to a gendarme on the island of Rapa begin with exhortations of responsibility: "You will take, from this date, command of the post of Rapa," a charge that includes organizing a school, mail service, weather station, supply house, and administrative office. These primary colonial institutions are enclosed within a familiar logic: "You will make all efforts to extend throughout this small population your beneficial and civilizing action." This evocation of the famous French imperial "civilizing mission" is in turn contained within the larger priority: "Your role will consist above all in making the natives love France, their new patrie."<br><br>Bougainville’s tales and the imperatives informing the gendarme’s posting and charge raise arresting questions. What historical configurations placed "France" and "natives" in relations of "love" for and against "empire" and "patrie"? What roles do these configurations play in writing of "the Pacific" as a place of Oceanic, Asian, and European engagements? I address these questions by interrogating empire as a shifting arrangement of Pacific places, bounded by and invested in demonstrations of love as vital constiutents of French imperial projects. Whether a yearning for exotic sensuality or political affinity, love was historically implicated in practices of rule, resistance, and alliance from Polynesia to Southeast Asia.<br><br>From Matt Matsuda, <i>Empire of Love</i>, 3-4.'); break;
			case 199: $("div#commentary").html('<b>VII</b><br><br>Thursday, November 28, 1901<br><br>About two o’clock in the morning. We are woken up, but deliciously and just barely, by a slow music, soft, never heard before and so strange ... It is not very far, nor very close ... flutes, dulcimers, zithers; maybe also chime bells, silver gongs punctuating the muted melody. At the same time we notice that the sound of the oars has stopped, the sampan goes no further. So we come to the end of our trip by water, and are now moored against the shore, probably in order to disembark at sunrise. The music continues, monotonous, always repeating the same phrases, phrases that do not tire but soothe like a lullaby. And we soon fall asleep again, having said to ourselves during these minutes of a half wakefulness: "This is good, we arrived in Siam, before some village, and there is a night festival ... in the pagoda ... in honor of the gods here ... "<br><br>Six thirty in the morning. Wake up again, but for good this time as it is daytime; between the boards that house us, we see rays of pink light filtering through. The music did not stop, always sweet and the same, mingled now with the dawn serenade of the roosters, with the sounds of the waking life that returns.<br><br>And it is a delight to look out! If the vegetation of the drowned forest, on which our eyes had closed, recalled that of our climate, here the extravagant tropical flora spreads in all sorts of palms of great green tails and plumes. We are facing a village on a small river with banks of flowers. Through the reeds, the rising sun casts its golden arrows everywhere. Thatched houses on stilts are aligned along a sandy path. Half-naked people, slender, copper torsos, circulate among the greenery. They come and go, partly to see us, but their looks are discrete, smiling and friendly. Flowers perfume: a scent of jasmine, gardenia, tuberose. In the pure light that reappears, this naive morning back-and-forth seems to be a scene of ancient times when man was still at peace. And then, accustomed as we were to the ugliness of Annam girls, who see only through two small oblique holes between clamped eyelids, how it changes us and calms us to arrive in the middle of a population that opens its eyes as we open ours!<br><br>And we dismounted, - in Siam . There, under a shed with a matted roof which is the pagoda, the musicians from that night, but who are now silent, stand crouched with their dulcimers, their flutes and their zithers. They gave all of this concert to humble Buddhist images, daubed in blue, red and gold, which are hung there and in front of which lie faded offerings of flowers: lotus, lilies and jasmine.<br><br>Now come my ox carts, ordered yesterday from the leader of the district; five carts, because there is room in each for only one person, against the back of the box. They resemble a sort of mandoline that would be put on wheels and that one would harness by its long handle, curved with a gondola prow.<br><br>We must make haste to leave, to get to Angkor before the burning noon. And the journey begins along the river by a narrow sandy path lined with reeds and flowers; it is under a colonnade of tall coconut trees where garlands of vines, flowering in clusters fall. It is an exquisite cool morning under these big palms; we pass through villages, quiet and beautiful as the golden age, where people watch us pass by with smiles of shy kindness. The race seems increasingly mixed with Indian blood, because many girls have big black eyes, shaded like those of dancing girls.<br><br>Stop after one hour in Siem Reap, a city almost, but quite Siamese, with its houses still perched on stilts, and its pagoda bristling with golden horns. However there is a small post office, very rural, where one can stamp his letters with stamps bearing the likeness of King Chulalongkorn. And a small telegraph office, because somebody brings me a telegram reading: "Resident Superieur of Phnom Penh to Governor of Siem-Reap. Would you please inform M. Pierre Loti that he will find four elephants in Kompong Luong on his return." It is as I desired; the four elephants, I had requested them from the good King Norodon in order to be able to go, after the pilgrimage of Angkor, to the pagoda where the ashes of the queen mother of Cambodia lie, in the middle of the woods.<br><br>After Siem Reap, our ox carts leave the river to turn into another sand road that plunges into the forest. Now suddenly there are no more big green plumes above our heads; all this coconut and arekier vegetation was located at the water’s edge; we penetrate beneath leaves that resemble those of our climate, only the trees that bear them would be giants next to ours. Despite much shade, the heat, as the sun rises, becomes more oppressive by the minute. Following the faint pathway through the disproportionate trees and impenetrable bush, our carts jump, to the trot of the oxen, between two rows of bushes and ferns. And careful monkeys climb the highest branches .<br><br>It was after about two hours of this race in the forest that the fabulous city suddenly revealed itself to our eyes, when we already felt taken by sleep, by dint of the bumps, the rocking and the heat.<br><br>Before us here a clearing takes shape; a marsh overgrown with grass and lilies; then a whole wide path to finally free ourselves of these woods where we had claustrophobically progressed. And further, beyond these stagnant waters, there are towers shaped like tiaras, towers in gray stone, prodigious dead towers looming over the sky pale with light! Oh! I immediately recognize them, they are definitely those from the old picture that had so troubled me once, an April evening in my childhood museum ... So I am in the presence of the mysterious Angkor!<br><br>However I had not the emotion I would have expected. It is doubtlessly too late in my life, I have seen too much of these great debris of great pasts, too many temples, too many palaces, too many ruins. [***The remaining English translation is from Google Translate.] Moreover, all this is as blurred as the glare of day ; seen evil, because it is too bright. And above all , midi approach with his weariness with his invincible drowsiness.<br><br>These colossal pregnant and towers that appear to us as just a mirage from the scorching heat , it is not the city itself, but only Angkor Wat , the main temple - from which we camp tonight. The city , Angkor Thom , we are told lies further huge and imprecise , buried beneath the rainforest.<br><br>To drive this basilica ghost , a bridge of old age , built in Cyclopean blocks, through the crowded pond with reeds and water lilies ; two monsters, eroded by time and all bearded lichen , guard the entrance ; it is paved with large slabs leaning and , in places, one would say near collapse in the greenish water. In no oxen , we are experiencing, almost asleep ; at the other end opens a door surmounted dungeons as tiaras , and flanked by two gigantic snakes cobras recover, éployant fan their seven stone heads .<br><br>And this gate, here we are inside of the first chamber , which has more than a league in circumference : a mournful solitude enclosed , simulating a neglected garden ; brush, entwined with jasmine fragrant , and where we see here and there arise debris turrets, statues close their eyes, or multiple heads great sacred cobras. The sun burns us, now that we have left the shade of the thick boughs . A paved avenue of gray stones lie before us his receding line , went straight to the sanctuary , the gigantic mass now dominates all things; avenue disaster from the middle of a small desert too mysterious , and lead to ruins , under a dying sun . But the closer we get to this temple , which we dedicated to permanent silence pensions, the more it seems that soft music reaches our ears - that are a little troubled , frankly , by the feverish heat and the need to sleep ... This is a yet distinct music concert insects and grinding our trucks ; it’s something like a slow human chanting in many voices ... Who can sing well in these ruins , and despite the overwhelming heaviness of noon? ...<br><br>When we are at the foot of the overwhelming masses of carved stone , terraces , stairs , towers that point in the sky , we meet the village where these prayers sung rise : high among some frail palm trees, houses on stilts, wood and matting, very light , with elegant scalloped small windows , which immediately garnish curious heads to see us coming . They are characters with shaved heads , all uniformly dressed in a lemon-colored dress and an orange drapery. They sing in a low voice and look at us without interrupting their quiet litany .<br><br>Very strange village, where there are no women , no cattle , no crops; nothing that these singers, yellow face and dressed in two shades of yellow. About two hundred monks from Cambodia and Siam , servants to guard the sacred ruins , live there in continual prayers , chanting day and night before the cluster titanic blocks accumulated in the mountains.<br><br>Nevertheless the arrival of our carts, oxen , our drovers , interrupts a moment their monotonous dream. To us home , two or three of them descended from perched houses , and the shining skull under the sun , advanced to meet us, unhurried and comfortable in this heat that falls squarely on the earth and the earth returns more unhealthy and more wet.<br><br>'); break;

Nous sommes réveillés, mais délicieusement et à peine, par une musique lente, douce, jamais entendue et si étrange... Ce n’est ni très loin, ni très près... Des flûtes, des tympanons, des cithares; on dirait aussi des carillons de clochettes, et des gongs argentins rythmant la mélodie en sourdine. En même temps nous percevons que le bruit des rames a fait trêve, que le sampan ne marche plus. Donc, nous voici au terme de notre voyage par eau, et amarrés sans doute contre la rive pour débarquer ensuite au lever du soleil. La musique persiste, monotone, répétant toujours les mêmes phrases, qui ne fatiguent pas mais qui bercent. Et nous nous rendormons bientôt, ayant dit en nous-mêmes, pendant ces minutes d’un demi-réveil: «C’est bon, nous sommes arrivés au Siam, devant quelque village, et il y a fête nocturne... dans la pagode... en l’honneur des dieux d’ici...»<br> <br>Six heures et demie du matin. Réveil encore, mais pour tout de bon cette fois, car il fait jour; entre les planches qui nous abritent, nous voyons filtrer des rais de lumière rose. La musique n’a pas cessé, toujours douce et pareille, mêlée maintenant à l’aubade sonore des coqs, aux bruits de la vie diurne qui revient.<br> <br>Et c’est un enchantement de regarder au dehors! Si la végétation de la forêt noyée, sur laquelle nos yeux s’étaient fermés, rappelait celle de nos climats, ici la plus extravagante flore tropicale s’éploie en toutes sortes de palmes, de grandes plumes vertes, de grands éventails verts. Nous sommes devant un village, sur une petite rivière aux berges de fleurs. A travers les roseaux, le soleil levant jette partout ses flèches d’or. Des maisonnettes de chaume, sur pilotis, s’alignent le long d’un sentier de sable fin. Des gens demi-nus, sveltes, aux torses cuivrés, circulent parmi la verdure. Ils passent et repassent, un peu pour nous voir, mais les regards sont discrets, souriants et bons. Les fleurs embaument: une odeur de jasmin, de gardénia, de tubéreuse. Dans la pure lumière qui renaît, ce naïf va-et-vient matinal semble une scène des vieux âges où l’homme avait encore la tranquillité. Et puis, habitués comme nous l’étions à la laideur des filles d’Annam, qui n’y voient qu’entre des paupières bridées, par deux petits trous obliques, combien cela nous change et nous repose d’arriver au milieu d’une population qui ouvre ses yeux à peu près comme nous ouvrons les nôtres!<br> <br>Et nous mettons pied à terre,--au Siam. Là-bas, sous un hangar à toiture de nattes qui est la pagode, les musiciens de cette nuit, qui ont cependant fait silence, se tiennent accroupis auprès de leurs tympanons, de leurs flûtes et de leurs cithares. Ils avaient donné tout ce concert pour d’humbles images bouddhiques, peinturlurées de bleu, de rouge et d’or, qui sont là pendues et devant lesquelles se fanent des offrandes de fleurs: lotus, nénufars et jasmins.<br> <br>Arrivent maintenant mes charrettes à b&oelig;ufs, commandées depuis hier au chef du district; cinq charrettes, car il n’y a place dans chacune que pour une seule personne, tout contre le dos du cocher. Elles ressemblent à des espèces de mandolines qui seraient posées sur des roues et que l’on aurait attelées par leur long manche, courbé en proue de gondole.<br> <br>Il faut se hâter de partir, afin d’arriver à Angkor avant le midi brûlant. Et le voyage commence en suivant l’étroite rivière par un sentier de sable bordé de roseaux et de fleurs; c’est sous une colonnade de hauts cocotiers d’où retombent des guirlandes de lianes, fleuries en grappes. Il fait une fraîcheur matinale exquise, sous ces grandes palmes; nous traversons des villages, tranquilles et jolis comme à l’âge d’or, où les gens nous regardent passer avec des sourires de bienveillance timide. La race semble de plus en plus mélangée de sang indien, car beaucoup de jeunes filles ont de grands yeux noirs, ombrés comme ceux des bayadères.<br> <br>Halte au bout d’une heure à Siem-Reap, presque une ville, mais tout à fait siamoise, avec ses maisonnettes toujours perchées sur pilotis, et sa pagode qui se hérisse de cornes d’or. Il y a cependant un petit bureau de poste, tout campagnard, où l’on peut affranchir ses lettres avec des timbres à l’effigie du roi Chulalongkorn. Et un petit bureau de télégraphe, car on m’apporte une dépêche ainsi conçue: «Résident supérieur de Pnom-Penh à gouverneur de Siem-Reap. Vous prie faire prévenir M. Pierre Loti qu’il trouvera quatre éléphants à Kompong-luong à son retour.» C’est à souhait; les quatre éléphants, je les avais fait demander au bon roi Norodon, afin de pouvoir me rendre, après le pèlerinage d’Angkor, à la pagode où reposent les cendres de la reine mère du Cambodge, au milieu des bois.<br> <br>Après Siem-Reap, nos charrettes à b&oelig;ufs quittent la rivière, pour tourner dans un autre chemin de sable qui plonge en pleine forêt. Alors c’est fini tout à coup des grandes plumes vertes au-dessus de nos têtes; toute cette végétation de cocotiers et d’arékiers se localisait au bord de l’eau; nous pénétrons sous des feuillages qui ressemblent à ceux de nos climats, seulement les arbres qui les portent seraient un peu des géants à côté des nôtres. Malgré tant d’ombre, la chaleur, à mesure que monte le soleil, devient de minute en minute plus accablante. Suivant le vague sentier, à travers la futaie démesurée et la brousse impénétrable, nos charrettes sautillent, au trot de nos b&oelig;ufs, entre deux rangées de buissons ou de fougères. Et les singes prudents grimpent au plus haut des branches.<br> <br>C’est au bout de deux heures environ de cette course en forêt que la ville fabuleuse tout à coup se révèle à nos yeux, quand déjà nous nous sentions pris par le sommeil, à force de cahots, de bercement et de chaleur.<br> <br>Devant nous voici de l’espace libre qui se développe; un marais envahi par les herbes et les nénufars; puis toute une vaste coupée, pour nous dégager enfin de ces bois où nous cheminions enfermés. Et plus loin, au delà de ces eaux stagnantes, voici des tours ayant forme de tiare, des tours en pierre grise, de prodigieuses tours mortes qui se profilent sur le ciel pâli de lumière! Oh! je les reconnais tout de suite, ce sont bien celles de la vieille image qui m’avait tant troublé jadis, un soir d’avril, dans mon musée d’enfant... Donc, je suis en présence de la mystérieuse Angkor!<br> <br>Cependant je n’ai pas l’émotion que j’aurais attendue. Il est trop tard sans doute dans ma vie, et j’ai déjà vu trop de ces débris du grand passé, trop de temples, trop de palais, trop de ruines. D’ailleurs, tout cela est comme estompé sous l’éblouissement du jour; on le voit mal, parce qu’il fait trop clair. Et puis, surtout, midi approche, avec sa lassitude, avec son invincible somnolence.<br> <br>Ces enceintes colossales et ces tours, qui viennent de nous apparaître comme quelque mirage de la torride chaleur, ce n’est pas la ville même, mais seulement <i>Angkor-Vat</i>, son principal temple,--auprès duquel nous devons camper pour ce soir. La ville, Angkor-Thom, on nous dit qu’elle gît plus loin, immense et imprécise, ensevelie sous la forêt tropicale.<br> <br>Pour conduire à cette basilique-fantôme, un pont des vieux âges, construit en blocs cyclopéens, traverse l’étang encombré de roseaux et de nénufars; deux monstres, rongés par le temps et tout barbus de lichen, en gardent l’entrée; il est pavé de larges dalles qui penchent et, par places, on le dirait près de crouler dans l’eau verdâtre. Au pas de nos b&oelig;ufs, nous le traversons, presque endormis; à l’autre bout s’ouvre une porte, surmontée de donjons comme des tiares, et flanquée de deux gigantesques serpents cobras qui se redressent, éployant en éventail leurs sept têtes de pierre.<br> <br>Et, cette porte franchie, nous voici en dedans de la première enceinte, qui a plus d’une lieue de tour: une morne solitude enclose, simulant un jardin à l’abandon; des broussailles, enlacées de jasmins qui embaument, et d’où l’on voit çà et là surgir des débris de tourelles, des statues qui ferment les yeux, ou bien des têtes multiples de grands cobras sacrés. Le soleil nous brûle, maintenant que nous avons quitté l’ombre des épaisses ramures. Une avenue dallée de pierres grises allonge devant nous sa ligne fuyante, s’en va droit jusqu’au sanctuaire, dont la masse gigantesque domine à présent toutes choses; avenue sinistre, passant au milieu d’un petit désert trop mystérieux, et pour mener à des ruines, sous un soleil de mort. Mais, plus nous approchons de ce temple, que nous pensions voué au définitif silence, plus il semble qu’une musique douce arrive à nos oreilles,--qui sont un peu troublées, à dire vrai, par la fiévreuse chaleur et le besoin de dormir... C’est bien une musique pourtant, distincte du concert des insectes et du grincement de nos chariots; c’est quelque chose comme une lente psalmodie humaine, à voix innombrables... Qui donc peut chanter ainsi dans ces ruines, et malgré les lourdeurs accablantes de midi?...<br> <br>Quand nous sommes au pied même des écrasantes masses de pierres sculptées, des terrasses, des escaliers, des tours qui pointent dans le ciel, nous rencontrons le village d’où montent ces prières chantées: parmi quelques hauts palmiers frêles, des maisonnettes sur pilotis, en bois et en nattes, très légères, avec d’élégantes petites fenêtres festonnées, qui se garnissent aussitôt de têtes curieuses, pour nous voir venir. Ce sont des personnages au crâne rasé, tous uniformément vêtus d’une robe couleur citron et d’une draperie couleur orange. Ils chantent à demi-voix et nous regardent sans interrompre leur litanie tranquille.<br> <br>Très singulier village, où il n’y a point de femmes, point de bétail, point de cultures; rien que ces chanteurs, jaunes de figure et vêtus en deux nuances de jaune. Environ deux cents bonzes du Cambodge et du Siam, préposés à la garde des ruines sacrées, vivent là dans les continuelles prières, psalmodiant nuit et jour devant l’amas des blocs titanesques accumulés en montagne.<br> <br>Tout de même l’arrivée de nos charrettes, de nos b&oelig;ufs, de nos bouviers, interrompt un instant leur monotone rêve. Pour nous faire accueil, deux ou trois d’entre eux descendent des maisonnettes perchées, et, le crâne luisant sous le soleil, s’avancent à notre rencontre, sans hâte et à l’aise, dans cette chaleur qui tombe d’aplomb sur la terre et que la terre renvoie plus malsaine et plus mouillée.<br>'); break;

His subsequent promotions led to an appointment as ship’s captain in 1906. <br><br>After the publication of his first novel, <i>Aziyadé</i> (1879), he rapidly developed a parallel literary career, winning the respect of critics and the devotion of a large public. With such successes as <i> Pêcheur d’Islande </i>(1886) and <i>Madame Chrysanthème</i> (1887) to his credit and with the approval of such exacting critics as Ferdinand Brunetière, Anatole France, Paul Bourget, and Jules Lemaître, the way was made smooth for his reception into the Académie Française in 1891. <br><br>Each year there was a new book, sometimes a novel—<i>Ramuntcho</i> (1897), <i>Les Désenchantées</i> (1906)—often treating objectively the love affairs with which he tried to satisfy his dreams and melancholy at every landfall, and sometimes a volume in which he himself figured—<i>Le Roman d’un enfant</i> (1890), <i>Prime Jeunesse</i> (1919), <i>Un Jeune Officier pauvre</i> (1923)—which reflected most fully his passionate nature. <br><br> An exceptionally gifted observer, he was able to return from his voyages with a rich store of pictorial images and embody them in simple, musical prose. But this literary impressionism served a deeper strain in his nature; death, as much as love, lies at the heart of his work, revealing a profound despair at the passing of sensuous life. <br><br> This despair was tempered by his tenderness and compassion for the human condition, and such books as <i>Le Livre de la pitié et de la mort</i> (1890) and <i>Reflets sur la sombre route</i> (1889) are perfect examples of his candid art—an art so simple that Lemaître asserted that it was impossible to discover “how it was done.”<br><br>“Pierre Loti,” from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica Online Academic Edition</i> (2014)'); break;

They grabbed everything that could be taken from where it was and put it in another place to serve a different use: brocade curtains ended up as sheets; in marble funerary urns they planted basil; wrought-iron gratings tom from the harem windows were used for roasting cat-meat on fires of inlaid wood. Put together with odd bits of the 106 useless Clarice, a survivors’ Clarice was taking shape. all huts and hovels. festering sewers, rabbit cages. And yet, almost nothing was lost of Clarice’s former splendor; it was all there, merely arranged in a different order, no less appropriate to the inhabitants’ needs than it had been before. The days of poverty were followed by more joyous times: a sumptuous butterfly-Clarice emerged from the beggared chrysalis-Clarice. The new abundance made the city overflow with new materials, buildings, objects; new people flocked in from outside; nothing, no one had any connection with the former Clarice, or Clarices. And the more the new city settled triumphantly into the place and the name of the first Clarice, the more it realized it was moving away from it, destroying it no less rapidly than the rats and the mold. Despite its pride in its new wealth, the city, at heart, felt itself incongruous, alien, a usurper. And then the shards of the original splendor that had been saved, by adapting them to more obscure needs, were again shifted. They were now preserved under glass bells, locked in display cases, set on velvet cushions, and not because they might still be used for anything, but because people wanted to reconstruct through them a city of which no one knew anything now. 107 More decadences, more burgeonings have followed one another in Clarice. Populations and customs have changed several times; the name, the site, and the objects hardest to break remain. Each new Clarice, compact as a living body with its smells and its breath, shows off, like a gem, what remains of the ancient Clarices, fragmentary and dead. There is no knowing when the Corinthian capitals stood on the top of their columns: only one of them is remembered, since for many years, in a chicken run, it supported the basket where the hens laid their eggs, and from there it was moved to the Museum of Capitals, in line with other specimens of the collection. The order of the eras’ succession has been lost; that a first Clarice existed is a widespread belief, but there are no proofs to support it. The capitals could have been in the chicken runs before they were in the temples, the marble urns could have been planted with basil before they were filled with dead bones. Only this is known for sure: a given number of objects is shifted within a given space, at times submerged by a quantity of new objects, at times worn out and not replaced; the rule is to shuffle them each time, then try to assemble them. Perhaps Clarice has always been only a confusion of chipped gimcracks, ill-assorted, obsolete.<br><br>from Italo Calvino’s <i>Invisible Cities</i>, 1972<br><br> '); break;

We can say that Commaille was the animator, the charming prince who woke up the wonderful relics of the Khmer civilization, a kind of sleeping beauty of thick forest.  It was he that with makeshift means, primitive tools, and teams of untrained coolies has been able to realize a miracle: make alive, in all their splendour of the older days, these architectural wonders that are Angkor-Wat and the Bayon. <br> <br>It has been the work of Commaille, in addition to all the difficulties he met and from which he succeeds thanks to an uncommon tenacity and nature.  We have to read all the monthly reports and his excavations journal to realize it.  Pirates, provoked by the Siam, or more exactly by the Phya Kathatorn, have early plagued the province of Siam-Reap.  One Saturday evening in April 1916, Commaille was on his way to the site in the middle of the Angkor forest to pay his coolies, when he was murdered by a gang of pirates who had been waiting for him, hiding in a thicket...  The appeal of the amount contained by the casher that he was carrying has been enough to explain the crime.  We should recall that at that time, the post of Siam-Reap was isolated during all the dry season, because no other means of communication were connecting it to more important centers except the Tonle Sap and the Grand Lac.  The police on the site had only limited means to reprimand piracy.  The Resident of Siem-Reap, in order to give care to the unfortunate Commaille who was still breathing when we brought him to his [Resident] home, came down to ask for advice to the doctor in Battambang by telegraph.  I was in charge of continuing the tragically disrupted work of the first Curative of Angkor.   Slowly, the village of Siam-Reap developed...  Some communication networks were created and a series of roads crossed the forest in all directions to link the important temples.  The tools that I had got better, cranes and hoists were installed to lift the rocks, and some Decauville trolleys quickly evacuated the ground removed from the excavations.  The study of the monuments using plans, sketches and pictures, came with their [the monuments] extrications.

A first mission, the one of Dufour and Carpeaux, the son of the famous sculptor, came to Bayon to photograph the long row of bas-reliefs, even though the territory was still Siamese.  It was the first time we introduced the shovel and pickaxe for a digging, very summary, of the famous temple, and for the first time, the formidable but also disconcerting chaos that is this monument, with no equals in the universe, agreed to release few of its secrets to archaeologists and art writers.  Because the Bayon is a real mystery that has been written about much--articles, papers, and well backed thesis have been written on the topic--and that still has unexpected surprises... ...We can affirm that there are always new things to discover in  the forest of Cambodia, despite the numerous scholars, archaeologists, art historians who have discovered the sport of trying to decipher the riddles of the Khmers sphinxes...  In one word, the Khmer civilization has been able to take the place it deserved among the great civilizations of Antiquity and the Middle-Ages...  From now on, l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient is well prepared and equipped to refurbish the temples that were previously buried in the bush, ruined and absorbed by the vegetation.

			case 243: $("div#commentary").html('Les meurtrissures d’Angkor à la fin du XIXe siècle<br><br>Ankor-Wat: « D’en haut, le plan du temple est facile à saisir… C’est, dans ses grandes lignes, une pyramide rectangulaire à trois gradins, dont le premier a 250 et le dernier 75 mètres de côté. Le troisième gradin mesure autant d’élévation que les deux premiers réunis, et tous les trois forment le piédestal d’un sanctuaire, dont la hauteur de 30 mètres est égale à celle des échelons que le portent. L’effet de ces doublements successifs dans les dimensions verticales est saisissant. Chacune des plates-formes est bordée d’une galerie cloîtrée. Huit préa-sat, tours dont la forme rappelle la fleur repliée du lotus, se dressent aux angles des galeries supérieures, étagées autour de la tour centrale, de façon à rendre plus svelte le massif de la pagode…<br><br>…D’un étage à l’autre, les architectes d’Angkor ont dû varier leurs effets et les graduer, en même temps que l’émotion religieuse du visiteur. Le doublement répété des élévations forme comme un crescendo, dont naît une impression de hauteur ; il est accompagné par un appauvrissement de la décoration intérieure: le visiteur semble être invite à se dépouiller de ses pensées terrestres au fur et à mesures que l’on précipite son ascension vers le sanctuaire…<br><br>…Il y des ruines que la patine des siècles a embellies et comme fardées ; le temps n’a eu que des outrages pour la vieillesse d’Angkor Wat. Il l’a salie. Le thma-phoc (1) est devenu verdâtre à l’endroit où battent les pluies de la mousson du Sud-Est, violacé là où le soleil a cuit les façades, et, partout la pierre a pris une couleur terne et triste. <br><br>La pagode n’est à son avantage qu’à l’heure du coucher du soleil, à l’instant fugitif où ses derniers rayons projettent sur le temple des flammes d’or auxquelles s’opposent de grandes ombres violettes. Mais, pour sentir le charme mystérieux, le je ne sais quoi de divin demeure en ces vieilles pierres, il faut errer dans les galeries d’Angkor Wat par une nuit de clair de lune, seul, sans torche, dans le grand silence qui plane sur la ruine, frémissant aux obscurités profondes des couloirs, cueillant au passage le sourire des Apsaras palies, tressaillant au bruit que les reptiles font en fuyant, anxieux du frôlement des chauves-souris qui veillent autour du sanctuaire”…<br><br>Angkor-Thom. — “… La forêt a escaladé les murs et la porte, a comblé le fossé de cent vingt mètres de largeur qui en défendait les approches. Sur la crête des murailles, sur les pinacles de la porte monumentale et jusque sur les têtes défigurées du dieu des Brahmanes, partout l’arbre touffu, le dernier conquérant d’Angkor, se dresse victorieusement; dans les branches, des singes et des écureuils jouent sans méfiance…<br><br>…Angkor-Thom, Angkor la Grande, s’est effondrée sous la poussée des sèves. De ses monuments, il reste seulement quatre temples et un palais ruinés, quelques débris de chausses, de terrasses et des vestiges de lacs artificiels. De ses fastes, évanouis dans la mémoire des hommes, il ne subsiste que de confuses légendes, et quelques inscriptions dont le déchiffrement commence à peine (2)…<br><br>…En face de nous, s’élève une montagne de blocs écroulés, hérissée d’arbres énormes. C’est ce qui fut le temple du Bayon, le plus beau et probablement le plus ancien des sanctuaires d’Angkor-Thom: aujourd’hui, un amas méconnaissable de murs éboulés, de galeries renversées, d’escaliers impraticables, de tours écrêtées, tordues, éventrées. <br><br>Sur cette œuvre de destruction lamentable s’élève triomphalement le figuier aux racines multipliantes, au tronc blanchâtre, tacheté comme celui du platane. Lorsque, à la faveur d’un peu de terre rencontrée par une graine, il a pris pied sur un monument, celui-ci est perdu; la plante qui a germé sur ses flancs le culbutera. Les racines de l’arbuste, ténues comme des fils, s’insinuent entre les assises les mieux jointes et franchissent des distances surprenantes pour atteindre le sol. La sève remonte alors, gonflant peu à peu la racine ; celle-ci commence par écarter doucement les blocs et, grossissant toujours, finit par faire effondrer l’édifice, au sommet duquel l’arbre, vainqueur de la pierre, déploie son panache de menu feuillage.<br><br>Angkor-Wat… n’a jamais été abandonné par les bonzes qui ont empêché la végétation de l’entamer. Malheureusement, personne n’a défendu les ruines d’Angkor-Thom contre l’envahissement de la forêt et les dégâts sont depuis longtemps irrémédiables…”<br><br>Emile VEDEL, Lumières d’Orient, Paris, 1901, p. 113-122 (3) <br><br>La résurrection d’Angkor<br><br>“En 1908 l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient put créer un poste de Conservateur d’Angkor et mon prédécesseur Jean Commaille (4) commença le lent et laborieux dégagement des monuments avec des crédits forts restreints. On put dire que Commaille fut l’animateur, le Prince charmant qui réveilla les merveilleux vestiges de la civilisation khmère, sorte de Belle au bois dormant au sein de la foret touffue. Ce fut lui qui, avec des moyens de fortune, un outillage très primitif, des équipes de coolies non entrainées, put réaliser ce miracle: rendre vivantes, dans toute leur splendeur de jadis, ces deux merveilles architecturales que sont Angkor-Wat et le Bayon.   <br><br> Ce que fut l’œuvre de Commaille, toutes les difficultés qu’il rencontra et dont il sut triompher par une ténacité et une décision de caractère peu communes, il faut, pour le savoir, lire ses rapports mensuels et son journal de fouille… Les pirates, suscites par le Siam, ou plus exactement par le Phya Kathatorn, infestèrent longtemps la province de Siam-Reap. Un samedi soir d’avril 1916, Commaille, en allant payer ses coolies sur les chantiers au milieu de la foret d’Angkor, fut assassine par une bande de pirates qui l’attendaient, caches dans un fourre… L’attrait de la somme contenue dans la caissette qui accompagnait Commaille suffit a expliquer le crime.    Il faut songer qu’a cette époque, le poste de Siam-Reap était isolé durant toute la saison sèche, car aucune autre voie de communication que le Tonle Sap et le Grand Lac ne reliait ce poste aux centres plus importants. La police sur place ne disposait que de moyens très insuffisants pour réprimer la piraterie. Le Résident de Siem-Reap, pour donner des soins au malheureux Commaille, lui respirait encore quand on l’eut ramené chez lui, fut réduit à demander des conseils au médecin de Battambang par le télégraphe.    Je fus charge de continuer l’œuvre si tragiquement interrompue du premier Conservateur d’Angkor. Peu a peu l’humble village de Siam-Reap se développa… Des voies de communication furent créées et une série de routes traversèrent la forêt en tous sens pour relier les temples importants… L’outillage dont je disposais s’améliora; des grues et des palans furent utilises pour lever les pierres et des wagonnets Decauville évacuaient rapidement les terres retirées des fouilles. L’étude des monuments au moyen de plans relevés, croquis et photos, accompagna leur dégagement. Grace à tous les documents ainsi recueillis, on peut se faire une idée précise et bien nette de ce qu’est l’architecture khmère; on peut désormais la comparer avec les architectures similaires de l’Inde et des autres pays d’Extrême-Orient et apprécier sa valeur esthétique…  …Une première mission, celle du Dufour et Carpeaux, le fils du célèbre sculpteur, vint au Bayon pour photographier la longue suite des bas-reliefs, alors que le territoire était encore siamois. Ce fut la première fois qu’on introduisit la pelle et la pioche pour un dégagement, très sommaire, du célèbre temple et, pour la première fois, le chaos formidable autant que déconcertant qu’est ce monument, sans égal dans l’univers, consentit a livrer quelques-uns de ses secrets aux recherches des archéologues et écrivains d’art. J’ai dit: quelques-uns de ses secrets. Car le Bayon est un véritable mystère qui a déjà fait couler des torrents d’encre, sur lequel des articles, des ouvrages ont été écrits, des thèses soutenues et qui, encore aujourd’hui, réserve des surprises inattendues… …On peut dire qu’il reste toujours du nouveau à découvrir dans les forêts du Cambodge, si nombreux qu’aient été les savants, les archéologues, les historiens d’art venus sur place essayer de déchiffrer les énigmes que propose les sphynx khmer… En un mot, la civilisation khmère a fini par prendre la place qu’elle mérite parmi les grandes civilisations de l’antiquité et du Moyen-Age… Désormais, l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient est préparée et outillée pour remettre en état les temples naguère enfouis dans la brousse, ruinés et absorbés par la végétation. Partout où les équipes de coolies du service archéologique sont venues travailler, le monument présente à nos yeux sa silhouette d’autrefois…<br><br>(Henri MARCHAL, Angkor, la résurrection de l’art Khmer et l’œuvre de l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient, Paris, s.d.

A first mission, the one of Dufour and Carpeaux, the son of the famous sculptor, came to Bayon to photograph the long row of bas-reliefs, even though the territory was still Siamese.  It was the first time we introduced the shovel and pickaxe for a digging, very summary, of the famous temple, and for the first time, the formidable but also disconcerting chaos that is this monument, with no equals in the universe, agreed to release few of its secrets to archaeologists and art writers.  Because the Bayon is a real mystery that has been written about much--articles, papers, and well backed thesis have been written on the topic--and that still has unexpected surprises... ...We can affirm that there are always new things to discover in  the forest of Cambodia, despite the numerous scholars, archaeologists, art historians who have discovered the sport of trying to decipher the riddles of the Khmers sphinxes...  In one word, the Khmer civilization has been able to take the place it deserved among the great civilizations of Antiquity and the Middle-Ages...  From now on, l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient is well prepared and equipped to refurbish the temples that were previously buried in the bush, ruined and absorbed by the vegetation.  Everywhere the team of coolies of the archaeological service came to work, the monument presents itself to our eyes the way it used to be in the olden days.<br><br>(Henri MARCHAL, Angkor, la résurrection de l’art Khmer et l’œuvre de l’Ecole française d’Extrême-Orient, Paris, s.d.

<b>VII</b><br><br>Thursday, November 28, 1901<br><br>About two o’clock in the morning. We are woken up, but deliciously and just barely, by a slow music, soft, never heard before and so strange ... It is not very far, nor very close ... flutes, dulcimers, zithers; maybe also chime bells, silver gongs punctuating the muted melody. At the same time we notice that the sound of the oars has stopped, the sampan goes no further. So we come to the end of our trip by water, and are now moored against the shore, probably in order to disembark at sunrise. The music continues, monotonous, always repeating the same phrases, phrases that do not tire but soothe like a lullaby. And we soon fall asleep again, having said to ourselves during these minutes of a half wakefulness: "This is good, we arrived in Siam, before some village, and there is a night festival ... in the pagoda ... in honor of the gods here ... "<br><br>Six thirty in the morning. Wake up again, but for good this time as it is daytime; between the boards that house us, we see rays of pink light filtering through. The music did not stop, always sweet and the same, mingled now with the dawn serenade of the roosters, with the sounds of the waking life that returns.<br><br>And it is a delight to look out! If the vegetation of the drowned forest, on which our eyes had closed, recalled that of our climate, here the extravagant tropical flora spreads in all sorts of palms of great green tails and plumes. We are facing a village on a small river with banks of flowers. Through the reeds, the rising sun casts its golden arrows everywhere. Thatched houses on stilts are aligned along a sandy path. Half-naked people, slender, copper torsos, circulate among the greenery. They come and go, partly to see us, but their looks are discrete, smiling and friendly. Flowers perfume: a scent of jasmine, gardenia, tuberose. In the pure light that reappears, this naive morning back-and-forth seems to be a scene of ancient times when man was still at peace. And then, accustomed as we were to the ugliness of Annam girls, who see only through two small oblique holes between clamped eyelids, how it changes us and calms us to arrive in the middle of a population that opens its eyes as we open ours!<br><br>And we dismounted, - in Siam . There, under a shed with a matted roof which is the pagoda, the musicians from that night, but who are now silent, stand crouched with their dulcimers, their flutes and their zithers. They gave all of this concert to humble Buddhist images, daubed in blue, red and gold, which are hung there and in front of which lie faded offerings of flowers: lotus, lilies and jasmine.<br><br>Now come my ox carts, ordered yesterday from the leader of the district; five carts, because there is room in each for only one person, against the back of the box. They resemble a sort of mandoline that would be put on wheels and that one would harness by its long handle, curved with a gondola prow.<br><br>We must make haste to leave, to get to Angkor before the burning noon. And the journey begins along the river by a narrow sandy path lined with reeds and flowers; it is under a colonnade of tall coconut trees where garlands of vines, flowering in clusters fall. It is an exquisite cool morning under these big palms; we pass through villages, quiet and beautiful as the golden age, where people watch us pass by with smiles of shy kindness. The race seems increasingly mixed with Indian blood, because many girls have big black eyes, shaded like those of dancing girls.<br><br>Stop after one hour in Siem Reap, a city almost, but quite Siamese, with its houses still perched on stilts, and its pagoda bristling with golden horns. However there is a small post office, very rural, where one can stamp his letters with stamps bearing the likeness of King Chulalongkorn. And a small telegraph office, because somebody brings me a telegram reading: "Resident Superieur of Phnom Penh to Governor of Siem-Reap. Would you please inform M. Pierre Loti that he will find four elephants in Kompong Luong on his return." It is as I desired; the four elephants, I had requested them from the good King Norodon in order to be able to go, after the pilgrimage of Angkor, to the pagoda where the ashes of the queen mother of Cambodia lie, in the middle of the woods.<br><br>After Siem Reap, our ox carts leave the river to turn into another sand road that plunges into the forest. Now suddenly there are no more big green plumes above our heads; all this coconut and arekier vegetation was located at the water’s edge; we penetrate beneath leaves that resemble those of our climate, only the trees that bear them would be giants next to ours. Despite much shade, the heat, as the sun rises, becomes more oppressive by the minute. Following the faint pathway through the disproportionate trees and impenetrable bush, our carts jump, to the trot of the oxen, between two rows of bushes and ferns. And careful monkeys climb the highest branches .<br><br>It was after about two hours of this race in the forest that the fabulous city suddenly revealed itself to our eyes, when we already felt taken by sleep, by dint of the bumps, the rocking and the heat.<br><br>Before us here a clearing takes shape; a marsh overgrown with grass and lilies; then a whole wide path to finally free ourselves of these woods where we had claustrophobically progressed. And further, beyond these stagnant waters, there are towers shaped like tiaras, towers in gray stone, prodigious dead towers looming over the sky pale with light! Oh! I immediately recognize them, they are definitely those from the old picture that had so troubled me once, an April evening in my childhood museum ... So I am in the presence of the mysterious Angkor!<br><br>However I had not the emotion I would have expected. It is doubtlessly too late in my life, I have seen too much of these great debris of great pasts, too many temples, too many palaces, too many ruins. [***The remaining English translation is from Google Translate.] Moreover, all this is as blurred as the glare of day ; seen evil, because it is too bright. And above all , midi approach with his weariness with his invincible drowsiness.<br><br>These colossal pregnant and towers that appear to us as just a mirage from the scorching heat , it is not the city itself, but only Angkor Wat , the main temple - from which we camp tonight. The city , Angkor Thom , we are told lies further huge and imprecise , buried beneath the rainforest.<br><br>To drive this basilica ghost , a bridge of old age , built in Cyclopean blocks, through the crowded pond with reeds and water lilies ; two monsters, eroded by time and all bearded lichen , guard the entrance ; it is paved with large slabs leaning and , in places, one would say near collapse in the greenish water. In no oxen , we are experiencing, almost asleep ; at the other end opens a door surmounted dungeons as tiaras , and flanked by two gigantic snakes cobras recover, éployant fan their seven stone heads .<br><br>And this gate, here we are inside of the first chamber , which has more than a league in circumference : a mournful solitude enclosed , simulating a neglected garden ; brush, entwined with jasmine fragrant , and where we see here and there arise debris turrets, statues close their eyes, or multiple heads great sacred cobras. The sun burns us, now that we have left the shade of the thick boughs . A paved avenue of gray stones lie before us his receding line , went straight to the sanctuary , the gigantic mass now dominates all things; avenue disaster from the middle of a small desert too mysterious , and lead to ruins , under a dying sun . But the closer we get to this temple , which we dedicated to permanent silence pensions, the more it seems that soft music reaches our ears - that are a little troubled , frankly , by the feverish heat and the need to sleep ... This is a yet distinct music concert insects and grinding our trucks ; it’s something like a slow human chanting in many voices ... Who can sing well in these ruins , and despite the overwhelming heaviness of noon? ...<br><br>When we are at the foot of the overwhelming masses of carved stone , terraces , stairs , towers that point in the sky , we meet the village where these prayers sung rise : high among some frail palm trees, houses on stilts, wood and matting, very light , with elegant scalloped small windows , which immediately garnish curious heads to see us coming . They are characters with shaved heads , all uniformly dressed in a lemon-colored dress and an orange drapery. They sing in a low voice and look at us without interrupting their quiet litany .<br><br>Very strange village, where there are no women , no cattle , no crops; nothing that these singers, yellow face and dressed in two shades of yellow. About two hundred monks from Cambodia and Siam , servants to guard the sacred ruins , live there in continual prayers , chanting day and night before the cluster titanic blocks accumulated in the mountains.<br><br>Nevertheless the arrival of our carts, oxen , our drovers , interrupts a moment their monotonous dream. To us home , two or three of them descended from perched houses , and the shining skull under the sun , advanced to meet us, unhurried and comfortable in this heat that falls squarely on the earth and the earth returns more unhealthy and more wet.<br><br>
