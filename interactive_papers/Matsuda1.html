She established a salon which was frequented by <b>Gambetta</b> and the other republican leaders against the conservative reaction of the 1870s. In the same interest, she founded the Nouvelle Revue in 1879, which she edited for eight years, and retained influence its administration until 1899.

Following his naval schooling and training, he was promoted ship’s lieutenant in 1881 and during 1885–91 saw service in Chinese waters. His subsequent promotions led to an appointment as ship’s captain in 1906. <br><br>After the publication of his first novel, <i>Aziyadé</i> (1879), he rapidly developed a parallel literary career, winning the respect of critics and the devotion of a large public. With such successes as <i> Pêcheur d’Islande </i>(1886) and <i>Madame Chrysanthème</i> (1887) to his credit and with the approval of such exacting critics as Ferdinand Brunetière, Anatole France, Paul Bourget, and Jules Lemaître, the way was made smooth for his reception into the Académie Française in 1891. <br><br>Each year there was a new book, sometimes a novel—<i>Ramuntcho</i> (1897), <i>Les Désenchantées</i> (1906)—often treating objectively the love affairs with which he tried to satisfy his dreams and melancholy at every landfall, and sometimes a volume in which he himself figured—<i>Le Roman d’un enfant</i> (1890), <i>Prime Jeunesse</i> (1919), <i>Un Jeune Officier pauvre</i> (1923)—which reflected most fully his passionate nature. <br><br> An exceptionally gifted observer, he was able to return from his voyages with a rich store of pictorial images and embody them in simple, musical prose. But this literary impressionism served a deeper strain in his nature; death, as much as love, lies at the heart of his work, revealing a profound despair at the passing of sensuous life. <br><br> This despair was tempered by his tenderness and compassion for the human condition, and such books as <i>Le Livre de la pitié et de la mort</i> (1890) and <i>Reflets sur la sombre route</i> (1889) are perfect examples of his candid art—an art so simple that Lemaître asserted that it was impossible to discover “how it was done.”<br><br>“Pierre Loti,” from <i>Encyclopedia Britannica Online Academic Edition</i> (2014)'); break;

	CHAPTER SIX
INDOCHINA<br>
Romance of the Ruins<br><br>
<p>
Two tales of ruins. In his "pilgrimage" to Angkor, the ancient site of
Khmer civilization, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Pierre Loti</a> trekked determinedly through "vegetation
of a drowned forest ... extravagant tropical flora spreads in
all sorts of palms of great green tails and plumes." As his party came into a
clearing, they were confronted by great stones, a scale of the "gigantic" all
under "a sun of death, definitive silence." <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> had awaited this moment
since he had read of Angkor in old colonial magazines and dreamed of its
temples as a child. Now, at a remove of thirty years, "I had not the emotion
I would have expected. It is doubtlessly too late in my life, I have seen too
much of these great debris of great pasts, too many temples, too many palaces,
too many ruins."1
</p><p>A dozen years later, the Vietnamese music and theater teacher Bui-Thanh-
Van made a trip to Angkor to see the famous temples. Like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a>, he
was taken by "curiosity, mystery, and the marvel" of the ancient ruins. Yet,
his account detailed what <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> essay related only as a solitary journey into
the jungle. As Bui's boat landed near a small river station, he noted, "I disembark
with a Frenchman, some Annamites, Cambodians, and Chinese in a
sampan." Upon reaching the riverbank, distinctions assert themselves: "The
Frenchman takes an automobile, some voyagers and I climb on a horsedrawn
omnibus; the others crouch in ox-carts." More, he wished to stay at
a hotel near the site of the ruins. "However, the French hotel, though not
having but a single French guest, will not take me, because I am yellow."2
Two tales of ruins: those ancient and colossal, taken by the forest and
memory, those recent and pained, marked by an Occidental presence. The
writers, French and Vietnamese, in search of a way to capture something of
Indochina-or, rather, their place in the "Indochina" of their own creation.
For his part, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> was consistent with his mordant vision of a world lost,
the seeker after the "eternal nostalgia" of his love for his childhood France.
Bui-Thanh-Van was a naturalized Francophile, founder of a classical music
school at Hue, and a man rankling from the indignities of daily life and a
status denied him as an Asian.
</p><p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> project is familiar: empire as collection-domesticating and
enclosing the world. "The ruins of Angkor, how well I remember a certain
April evening, a bit veiled, how they appeared to me in a vision." Secure in
Rochefort, the young Julien Viaud dreamed of possessing Angkor as a fantasy.
Yet, as the writer and naval officer <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Pierre Loti</a> stationed in Southeast
Asia, he regretted, ~The first curiosity past, I do not like this country, nor
any creature of this sad yellow race, it is truly the land of exile ... there has
never been but love that could attach me in a somewhat durable fashion to
certain places on earth. "3
</p><p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> faraway childhood Angkor failed, for the love and attachment
he evoked always remained for home and France, where the "old sitting
mother" waited for her sailors and soldiers "far away on the sea or in lands of
exile."4 His grandiose, melancholic vision reinforced his reputation as master
of imperial nostalgia. Reflecting on "our yellow empire," in 1917 Indochina,
Ligue Maritime et Coloniale Française Director Maurice Rondet-Saint
groused, "Do not expect from me another description of the ruins of Angkor.
The subject is already exhausted; it came to be so while being popularized
by Le Pèlerin d 'Angkor of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a>. "5
</p><p>Yet, as we learn from Bui-Thanh-Van, the subject was not exhausted.
Bui saw something quite particular in the ruins at Angkor. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> oppressive
meditation carries his decadent burden of history, the enervation of the soul.
At Angkor, the temples were characterized by their mute incomprehension,
their weight and decay. Bui rather found the temples alive with messages
and meanings: "They have spoken proudly, and not without justice, to succeeding
generations of an ancient power of an Oriental people. This testimony
will be carried still to the eternity of future centuries." Where <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> saw
"colossal, cyclopean blocks of stone, invincible somnolence," Bui related a
living culture, "diverse sculptures and refined carvings representing subjects
and scenes from the four reigns of nature, from political life, as well as from
arts and industries."6
</p><p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> morose tone is unsurprising: "Indochina" was always for him a
place of death. His other connected writings, such as his 1883 accounts from
Tonkin and Hue, detail French military assaults in which "Annamites fell
in groups," trying to escape naval fire by "running on all fours." Tumbling
into the river, royal soldiers were likened to bobbing seals to be picked off by
French sharpshooters until "there is no one left to kill." At the same time,
he railed loudly against the government at Paris which sent "to die far away
the bravest and best of the nation ... may the blood of our sailors be on
the hands of our miserable politicians."7 Bui was the successor to this era
of military conquest, the Francophile Vietnamese observant of both Asian
heritage and Occidental prejudice, one who embraced Gallic culture and
administration yet who also saw something deeply proud and "Oriental" in
the ruins at Angkor.
</p><p>What draws the two accounts together is their romance of the ruins. For
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a>, it is an evocation of his childhood France and the beloved sailors serving
in her name. Bui's response, although bitterly critical of life under colonialism,
is astonishingly similar, betraying the complexities of the Empire of
Love in Southeast Asia. As <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> referred his journeys back to the domestic
sentimentality of Rochefort and the patriotic maternal nationalism of
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Juliette Adam</a>; so, too, did Bui imagine himself the (perhaps unappreciated)
son of a loving French mother. "It would be naive to think that France has
crossed seven thousand kilometers of ocean to come in good will, extending
us a hand, without expecting anything of us. She perfectly has all the rights
that justice confers upon an adoptive mother." Bui even asserts a parallelism
between naval officers and motherly love: "The policy of our affectionate
adoptive mother is the same as that applied by a generous ship's captain
regarding strangers stowed away on board." He also finds common cause
with "our good adoptive brothers ... they honor their mother as they make
themselves honorable; they love all as they make themselves loved. "8
</p><p>From <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> beloved sailors in gunboat conquest to Bui's adoptive mother
and brothers, tales of love frame a chronology of France and Cochinchine,
Annam, Tonkin, Laos, and Cambodia as they were protected, possessed,
and colonized into "Indochina." From the middle nineteenth century, military
men such as <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> and Captain Francis Garnier declared missions of
passionate fraternalism become patriotism, adventures transmuted into the
"Conquest of Hearts" of the diplomat and geographer Auguste Pavie at the
turn of the century. The "possession of the native" promoted by colonialists
was realized in civil policy of the early twentieth century through state-approved
mixed liaisons and colonial marriage fictions of writers such as the
novelist Clothilde Chivas-Baron. The possibilities and limits of this imperial
romance were tested and constantly renegotiated by generations of Vietnamese
like Bui or writer Tran Van Tung, who accepted France as affectionate
mother, brother, or lover, or the anticolonial essayist Nguyen An Ninh,
who reversed the romance, saying, "It is not for a sentimental project that
France has gone to Indochina .... One would have to be the most stupid sort
of colonial to believe in 'the Civilizing Mission.'"9
</p><p>As a colony under a French governor, "Indochina" was the heart of an
empire that extended from the Mekong delta to Panama. The combined
territories harbored the only substantial French settler population
in the Pacific and the only commanding landmass. Official bulletins highlighted
the sheer scale of the territory: "Our colony has a surface area of
68o,ooo square kilometers, about 15o,ooo kilometers more than France."10
As the jewel of French overseas empire and her "balcony on the Pacific,"
Indochina also shaped the Oceanic colonies through the leverage of the
Banque de l'Indochine, and through the Tonkinese and Annamite workers
sent to labor-poor settlements in New Caledonia and the New Hebrides.
The French navy first intervened in the Southeast Asian kingdom of
Annam in the 1850s, establishing a protectorate over the adjoining territory
of Cochinchine ostensibly to defend the work of the Cad1olic church. This
"time of the admirals" was characterized by complicated military and diplomatic
maneuvering between French governors and Annamite rulers at Saigon
governing Cochinchine, the emperor at Hue in Annam, and mandarins
in Tonkin at Hanoi. A series of celebrated military conflicts under Francis
Garnier and Henri Rivière-both of whom were killed-was succeeded by
armed colonial rule under governors including Paul Bert (1886), Jean Louis
De Lanessan (1891-1894), Paul Doumer (1897-1902), and Albert Sarrault
(1911-1919) who administratively bounded the regions into the Union of
Lndochina.11
</p><p>Cultural and political confrontation lay at the heart of developing
colonial narratives-both French and Vietnamese-which built upon and
underscored for effect the differences between peoples, while also courting
their loyalty and association. In one 1922 novella, the colonial writer Clotilde
Chivas-Baron has the Annamite emperor compare "positive and organizing
France, practical France ... and Annam, the delicious country of immobility
and dreams." In the same tale, another character praises the emperor as one
who "understands the French, or at least tries to understand them ... it is
necessary to understand them to love them."12
</p><p>From the middle nineteenth century, many of the stories that shaped
France's presence in Southeast Asia were recorded as variations of histoires
d'amour. Successive governments in Paris took up the colonial imperative,
most significantly the ministries of Jules Ferry, whose stormy tenure ended
in 1885 when he was voted down during a series of military setbacks and
sovereignty debates branded "The Tonkin Affair." During that period Ferry
himself was famously branded "le Tonkinois" for his pro-colonial policies.
His supporters, such as the Saigon mayor and Cochinchine deputy Jules
Blancsubé, defended him with political love stories, arguing "there are ten
million souls ... wishing for nothing but to give themselves to us." To Ferry's
proclamations of empire, Blancsubé wrote the prime minister of “the sweet
tears that you have made me weep upon reading these lines where resonate
the purest patriotic fiber and vibrant accents of energy and sentiment ... to
see so noble a cause defended by such a noble heart ... to raise oneself reassured,
moved, loved!"13
</p><p>Love-patriotic, spiritual, or sexual-was an infinitely adaptable language
of empire. From the contested colonies came the kind of stories on
which <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Pierre Loti</a> made his name: military men in erotic liaison with exotic,
often subordinated or prostituted females. In his memoirs of service in
Tonkin, the former naval officer Jean Léra praised Governor General Paul
Bert for sagely balancing sex and danger by instituting regulations cautioning,
though not forbidding, Frenchmen from visiting the "native women . . .
similar to poisonous plants." Within Bert's imperium, gushed Léra, "Eros
alone reigns as master and Mercury remains outside the door." Citing Bougainville's
imagery of Cythère and promised paradise,' Léra thanked Bert's
"patriotic direction" for keeping Frenchmen in their "amorous pastimes"
while also healthy and robust.14
</p><p>A bit more subtly, M. Brenier, a colonial undersecretary, recounted
the taking of the Mekong in a sexualized language. Glorious memories of
French conquest "come rushing into the mind at the view of this Mekong
of powerful and deceitful waters which have not responded to the hopes of
patriotic sailors, who hoped to find in them [elles, the French feminine] one
of the greatest routes of penetration in the world-two thousand kilometers-
toward fecund and unexplored regions. "15
</p><p>As seen around the Pacific, the church is repeatedly invoked as a force
whose mission is to spread the love of Christ, and at times, church and military
are conflated. Upon dying in the Tonkin campaign, the commander
Berthe de Villers managed to expire while evoking narration, marriage,
faith, and profession: "Write to my wife that I die as a soldier and a Christian."
Biographers of Captain Francis Gamier-who dreamed of opening
the Red River all the way to China and was killed in combat-sympathetically
trace a turbulent career in languages of religion and affection. Paul
Antonini's partisan history begins, "The flag of France floats in Indochina
side by side with the cross." Antonini then cites Garnier as a man whose
mission was driven by love of France and family. As the officer ponders a
bleak moment in his career: "My discouragement in this regard is great
enough for me to decide to quit a career which I love but which is more
honorable than lucrative, if I find another that will assure the survival of
those I love. "16
</p><p>In his own official address to his troops, Garnier deliberately invoked
a politics of love to frame his conflation of civilization, force, and colonial
hierarchy. "Sailors and soldiers, in sending you to Tonkin to protect the
interests of French civilization, the governor-admiral has granted you the
favor of showing proof of his trust ... you will therefore abstain from any
act of brutality, and you will by all of your efforts make loved and respected
the flag which you bear." Jean Baptiste Eliacin Luro, Garnier's comrade and
director of the College des Stagaires de Saigon, rhapsodized in 1877 about
his friend's fate by extolling those who "have loved Cochinchine unto death
... happy are those among us who will have had the honor of dying after
having so long suffered and worked for our country."17
</p><p>Recalling the fates of such expeditions, the adventurer the Due de Montpensier
reiterated, like <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> and so many imperialists, the logic of grand
emotion as an integral component of nation and empire. Paying homage
to "valiant naval officers," Montpensier insisted to his readership that "my
sailor's heart imposes the duty of according a moving remembrance ... I love
Indochina, and I feel the need to glorify, even if only with a brief memory
and modest mention, the valiants to whom you are indebted." In imposing a
settlement at Hue on King Kiên Phuc during the Tonkin campaign, French
diplomats drafted the monarch's pronouncement, "I love France greatly, and
I will do all that is possible to please the French."18 To love and be loved by
Indochina was the articulation of French empire: the shaping of the nation
and its conquests.
</p><p>Perceptions were modified by the long history of struggles and domination.
Reporting on an early 1861 Cochinchine expedition when French
forces were still tentative, Leopold Pallu de la Barrière organized this writing
around metaphors du coeur: "The Annamites have ... a certain bravado,
even an occasional courage, because their passions are from the heart." In
the same report he encoded such strength as a form of savagery by suggesting
a "terrifying superstition": "When one of them is killed, they open up
his body, tear out the heart, devour it still beating." During the invasion of
Tonkin, 188r1885, the campaign's early chronicler Dick de Lonay reported,
"The Annamites hold their positions and keep up their fire, they are most
assuredly brave." Yet by the era of formal colonialism after 1885, such images
are heavily modified. In 1886, the historian and geographer A. Paulus said
"The Annamites are sweet and docile, capable still of resistance, reflective,
timid, cheerful." As will befit a chief administrator, Governor General De
Lanessan's 1889 view is completely pacific and concerned with productivity:
"The Annamite people are sweet, hard-working, peaceful, attached to the
land that they water with their sweat. "19
</p><p>This transition to the docile and rather "ethnographic" Asian was abetted
by a new French romance with Indochina, one shaped and widely popularized
by editorials, essays, and travel accounts by highly visible colonial figures
such as the politician Jules Blancsubé and the diplomat and geographer
Auguste Pavie. If the period of direct military conquest was marked by tales
of bravado and fierce, patriotic passions, the decades of administrative territorial
expansion and mapping were characterized by stories of benevolent
protection.
</p><p>As Saigon mayor and delegate to the Chamber of Deputies in Paris,
Blancsubé was one of the most forceful voices for colonialism as a politics
of love. A long-time resident of Cochinchine, he rooted his family romance
there: "I adopted it for my own, I created my family there, I owe it my
existence. And it is because I love it, that I have tried for so long to make it
known and to conquer for it a place in the patrie and to become the loveliest
possession of the republic. "20 His ability to evoke family, conquest, possession,
and patrie within the context of "I love" was exemplary, although
not unusual. Such talent was critical in parliamentary struggles for budget
credits against eloquent colonial skeptics such as Georges Clemenceau or
Leon Renault, who warned, "France should greatly hesitate before engaging
great expenses, of running the risk entailed by the pursuit of colonial
possessions."
</p><p>Blancsubé's lobby of supporters, by contrast, played up his good colonial
image as "head of a model family that has raised eleven children," presenting
him as a "passionate servant of his country." Pro-colonial ideology revolved
around establishing "a union necessary and fecund" with the mother country.
The colonial newspaper Le Saigonnais even proposed a vocabulary that
would have done <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Juliette Adam's</a> maternal nationalism proud: "Let us see if
by these diverse obligations we could substitute ourselves for the mere-patrie
and become what in recent debates has been called a mere-colonie. "21 Le MéKong
thundered, "Should we abandon ... this Tonkinese population that is
persecuted because it has faith in us?" To be emphatic, the editors insisted:
"The Tonkinese people love us, they want to give themselves to us. "22
</p><p>This vision of amorous surrender was most widely and effectively developed
by Auguste Pavie, one of the major figures in the post-conquest age of
French control in Southeast Asia. Following stints with the navy and postal
services, he was a minister plénipontentiaire based in Siam at the turn of
the century, and leader of the eponymous Mission Pavie that mapped and
detailed much of Indochina for French governors. With his maps, natural
histories, photographic collections, and ethnographic studies of Indochina,
Pavie, noted one admirer, "long worked at her territorial enlargement, and
has given so much at helping understand her." One colonial archivist and
historian even argued that Pavie's work provided the basis for "the map of
Indochina and the administrative structure of the country." In I885, France,
"solidly fixed to the south of the peninsula possessed nothing to the north
but a few precarious bases ... in I895 French Indochina had become a political
and economic reality. "23
</p><p>In his political correspondence, Pavie was very much the expansionist,
writing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "France would commit a great
error in contenting herself with the Mekong as the limit of our Laotian possessions
... we should wish that the Mekong be a French river." But he made
his reputation by assuming the persona of benevolent explorer and special
protector of Cambodia and Laos: "As much as the resistance from Siam is
violent, our advance should be calm and firm. We have the populations ...
they await our deliverance. "24
</p><p>Pavie's own notebooks, preserved at Aix-en-Provence and still lined with
the occasional seedpod or fragment of butterfly wing, trace the strategic and
sentimental itineraries of a man who chose as his motto "one most have
heart!"25 Not surprisingly, Pavie's best-known book, based on his journals
and oral histories, was his A la conquête des coeurs (Conquest of Hearts), a
work particularly worth detailing for its wide impact. Georges Clemenceau
himself wrote the preface to the 1921 edition, calling it "the best colonial
book that I know." What the "Tiger" of French politics so admired was not
a tale of ferocious adventure but of one man, "barefoot, without provisions,"
marching though Southeast Asia "toward that ideal to make the lands you
crossed French with the assent of their inhabitants." What Clemenceau particularly
fixed on was Pavie's ability to relate stories of “populations you have
seduced ... and which you love; you have dedicated yourself to inspire in
them the sentiments for France that you yourself have for her." The result
of this was a particular kind of empire: "Having given birth to devotion, you
have, in gaining their hearts, conquered lands that, morally, give themselves
up upon knowing you."26
</p><p>Clemenceau was only reveling in Pavie's own self-fashioning as imperialist
as protector. The "barefoot" Pavie of Clemenceau's reading contrasts
with Pavie as minister at Bangkok greeted by the unfurling of the tricolor
and "thirteen cannon shots from the forts at Paknam." Pavie's own reports
from Cambodia detail him selectively as a man in a canoe taking the hands
of villagers and insisting, "The French are good, they will love you as I love
you and will take you to their hearts." Local chiefs apparently told Pavie
they have "loved him already" even before his arrival in their region, "after
all of our misfortunes, we have a chance, you are here, seated before us, you
smile at us, and we touch you!" Pavie used his influence to obtain freedom
for captives in disputed territories between Laos and Siam, and the outpouring
of devotion and gratitude are recorded as "eloquent testimonials
oflove."27
</p><p>Pavie's is not the only voice advancing these testimonials; his protégés
also adopted his vision. One, Deo Van Tri, addressed Pavie "Cher Protecteur"
in his letters, and was given a French education and even a trip to Paris with
his family. Unable to ever repay such debts, he wrote his master, "We will
work for the good of the country and will guide the inhabitants on the road
of progress, and we will make it understood that France loves us greatly and
wishes that we become one day an equal people. "28 In such recognition Pavie
realized intimately what Jules Blancsubé set out schematically by outlining
the "perfectly defined civilizing role" of French imperial policy: "The goal
of our interventions was not conquest, but to protect the country ... the
Annamite being still too weak to protect himsel£"29
</p><p>The grandest popular expression of this affectionate protection and
tutelage was in Parisian colonial expositions where reproductions of "great
pagodas" housed discreet presentations of prosperous and grateful colonies.
A replica of the grand pagoda of Cholon in Cochinchine became, at the
I9oo Paris Exposition, a warehouse for abundant rice, sugar, bamboo, cotton,
cacao, wax, and honey. "Equally," notes a program, "there are in this pagoda
... models of great iron bridges and works of Indochinese art commissioned
in France by the governor general."30 The Palais des Arts displayed
parasols, fans, and works in bronze and ivory; the Palais des Forets a selection
of bamboo constructions and exhibits of fishing and tanning of animal
skins. Perhaps most fascinating was a series of dioramas in the grotto of
the "Pagoda of Buddhas," which juxtaposed images of tradition-the tomb
of the Emperor Tu-Duc-with French modernity-the construction of the
Doumer bridge, "one of the most important works of art undertaken in the
colonies." A cinema projection completed the simulacra of the colony by
screening "the illusion of lndochinese life with its animation and particular
character. "31
</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Pavie played a major role in such expositions. His notes
for public presentations in 1900 are initially framed in a language we recognize
from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> Southeast Asian lands: "I had dreamed of their distant
antiquity in solitary walks among ruins, in the woods, along the waters."
Pavie's work also is reflexively modeled on the collection. Among his achievements
for the exposition was the materialization of "thirteen life-size wax
figures representing types-men, women, and children of the least-known
populations." Despite Pavie's "men, women, and children" pronouncement,
according to the program they were overwhelmingly female: "A group of
inhabitants of Muong-Sing, north of Laos, a young Meo girl, two women of
Laos, a Pou-Thaie woman, a woman of Luang-Prabang, a north Kha-Kho
woman, a young Lue girl of northern Laos, a Laotian woman. "32
</p><p>Pavie's displays quickly evolved into narratives of ethnography as love
story. The discourses of passion and possession asserted themselves as Pavie
eschewed formal scientific language to assert, "I love the Cambodians," a
people he defines as "simply good and open-hearted." In an elegant summary,
he clarified the ways in which his love was a form of historical understanding,
one that rendered his subjects both appropriately glorious and
nonthreatening. "I love them also for the mystery of their past in which
an instinctive memory of glory, joined to the knowledge of evils that have
made them forget, gives them all at once a nuance of pride and renders
them timid."
</p><p>Pavie loved the Cambodians in their surrendered present. Writers often
employed or adopted such an aesthetic of lndochina as collection-bounded
and securely held in the past. Essayists for <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">Juliette Adam's</a> Nouvelle Revue,
such as Albert Savine, traveled in Cambodia, concentrating on festivities
that followed "the immemorial usage, the triumphal processions of knights,
chariots, and mounted elephants. “The people's martial spirit is now strictly
ceremonial. "[They] live for the circumstance, to take out of the arsenals and
the palaces the arms of long ago, such as one sees in the Khmer section of
ethnographic museums or the galleries of the Guimet museum. "33

</p><p>At Angkor, French savants eventually did declare themselves the saviors
of Khmer patrimony. As one archaeologist put it, "Khmer civilization has
finally taken the place it merits among the great civilizations of antiquity
and the Middle Ages ... henceforth, the Ecole française d'extrême orient is
prepared and outfitted to restore temples formerly lost in the bush, ruined,
and absorbed by vegetation. Wherever teams of coolies in archaeological
service have come to work, the monument presents to our eyes its silhouette
of another time." Asian labor under French authority shaped remote past as
well as present and future.34
</p><p>In like fashion at the colonial exposition, Pavie detailed the means by
which he became the protector of his beloved Cambodians. His transcription
of a historic tale "is the first which, translated entirely in French, was
printed in the Cambodian language, as the author had promised the people
of the village who furnished him the text." In presenting the work to the
villagers, Pavie became a narrator of Indochina. "That day things did not
go as usual; everyone declared that I surely knew the little that was known
and that I myself should be the storyteller [ conteur ]. "The elders of the village
effectively transferred their history to the Frenchman: "What we would
be happy to hear, is what you think from your voyages, your studies, of the
unknown past of our old Cambodia; what you will later tell to those of your
own country."
</p><p>In this tale of affection, Pavie, whose works were lauded as imperial
instruments by his government, resolved his passion by preserving the history
of the conquered as folkloric tradition. His motto engaged the past:
"I know how passionately the Khmers love to retell the legendary eras."
Indeed, the Khmer seemed to look to him for their history. "We believe
our hearts remain open more than those peoples who have crushed us; why
then haven't we been able to bear the weight of our old glories? We return
to these subjects over and over again; will you tell us about it?" Inflections of
meaning are small but telling; where Pavie spoke of the "legendary" eras, his
interlocutors showed their appreciation by engaging the present. "We will
take up your idea, happy to be able ourselves to tell again of these old times
with greater confidence."35 Whereas he preserved their past as past, they
sought the authority to recapture their own history.
</p><p>This also was what Bui-Thanh-Van described when in the stones and
reliefs at Angkor he saw not melancholy ruins but proofs of the "ancient
power of an Oriental people," and evidence of a testimony "carried still to
the eternity of future centuries." Proud of the heritage, he nonetheless also
acknowledged that it was a French savant behind "the teams of natives scattered
across the jungle" who were doing the restorations, and he praised this
work, "an undertaking worthy of a leading nation. She saves the celebrated
Khmer vestiges which the universe contemplates with ecstasy. "36 Angkor
was one of Bui's cogent figures for Indochina in the early twentieth century;
it was not a silent monument but a product of collaborations and contested
meanings. His romance of the ruins is important for its recognition-if at
times bitterly so-of the depth of interaction between the cultures and the
realities of an inescapable common destiny.
</p><p>At the Angkor site, Bui contemplated with some irony the hotel-keeper
of "Chinese and Cambodian blood, correctly speaking French, dressed in
European style," carrying out "by order of his boss the exclusion of passengers
of color from this establishment. "Yet he simultaneously defended "ideal,
generous, just, humanitarian'' France, "mother of forty million children." His
reality was inescapably entangled with the powerful ideology of the Empire
of Love. It was in grand principle that he lauded his French brothers: "They
share the joys and pains of the people whose mission they have to guide
along the road to progress ... they devote themselves it every way to improve
their condition. They have love for France, and for the France of Asia."37
</p><p>In the early twentieth century defining love within this "France of Asia"
became a recurring figure in colonial contemplations. Bui's contemporary,
constitutionalist activist Nguyen Phan-Long, dedicated a 1921 novel to Governor
General Maurice Long "with the hope that my modest work will contribute
to helping him better understand and love the people over whose destiny
he presides." Love in this case took on a specific configuration. Advising
a young woman wishing to marry an Annamite, Nguyen counseled, "I would
wish that many of your compatriots would follow your example. Marriages
like yours will achieve the indissoluble unity of the Great France of Europe
and the France of Asia."38
</p><p>Such projects-common destiny realized in marrying the empire-were
abetted by the size and complexity of Indochina as a colony. Although
derided, like Oceania, as isolated and thus backward, the France of Asia did
not overtly suffer from the dominant narrative of smaller possessions-the
extinction of the natives. The many peoples of "Indochina" were not simply
going to die off. As the geographer Augustin Bernard theorized, "the
Annamites of Indochina are not tending to disappear. This is because ...
Annamites are not savages; they are in certain respects barbaric, but that is
quite different."39 As <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> fatal exoticism gave way to colonial administration,
the dynamics of empire and authority in Indochina were not those of
the gradual expiration of the Annamites, Tonkinese, Khmers, Laotians, and
other peoples, but the assimilation of their history.
</p><p>Auguste Pavie's missions and colonial exhibitions aptly illustrated this
process in the later nineteenth century: France sought to produce and
searched for in Indochina gratitude, affection, loyalty, and thus identification
and compliance with the imperial project. Jules Blancsubé, arguing for intervention
in Tonkin, specified "the only policy we will follow, the only which
is truly French and truly republican" would be to see the Tonkinese as "our
natural friends," a "brave and sweet population," in need of support against
the aggressions of mandarins in Annam. As one A. Bouinais, a naval captain
of infantry put it with verve, "After the conquest by arms, it remains to us to
effectuate the more difficult act of possession-that of the native. "40
</p><p>Such possession required another shift in the Empire of Love. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> and
Garnier had loved in the name of France and fellow sailors; Pavie and Blancsubé
were partisan "protectors" of colonial interests and native populations.
As the military adventurers of the 187os and 188os became the administrators
and colonists of "Indochina'' at the end of the nineteenth century, so
in the twentieth the notion of "natural friends" became more complex and
intimate. The "possession of the native" developed formally and was widely
explored through civil policy and the possibilities of colonial marriage and
mixed liaisons.
</p><p>Tales from earlier periods fixed upon basic commodity transactions.}. L.
Dureuil de Rhins's 1879 travel ethnography of Annam, for example, included
an almost obligatory exchange in which the author, upon being offered lodging
along a river, inquired, "Can't one also purchase women?" His interlocutor
readily riposted, "Certainly. A woman costs wo-150 francs," though he
cautioned, "but the toilette, the jewels, will cost ten times more."41 Women
could always be appropriated to the status of congaï-like poupée or vahine
in Polynesia, or musumé in Japan, the role of the European man's mistress.
</p><p>In the first decades of the twentieth century, civil court cases and "colonial"
literary pieces engaged with much greater subtlety tales of marriage as
highly visible figures for expressing love of lndochina. The writer Clothilde
Chivas-Baron mastered this genre in works such as Three Annamite Women
and Confidences de métisse. Chivas-Baron, winner of the Grand prix de littérature
colonial in 1927, author of a patriotic and jaundiced advice manual,
La Femme aux colonies, and many popular works of folklore and history of
French Indochina, created in her tales strong and willful women, weak,
boorish, or .tragic men, and Indochina as a female principle. Her stories
revolve around the negotiation of intimate relationships, from Thi-Vinh,
who holds aloof from the French, to Hoa, who marries them. Possessing
Indochina is manifested in these narrations as the characters struggle with
survival, spiritual strength, and moral purpose within shattering calamities
of history-including the French presence and colonial domination.
</p><p>The French "authoring" of empire is prominently featured in Chivas-Baron's
novella "Madame Hoa's Husbands,/ which traces the life of an
Annamite woman married to three successive Frenchmen. Early on, the
young Hoa nearly pronounces on the narrated nature of French Indochina,
"In France, it seems, those who don't travel want to know what is going on
in other countries. They read for their instruction books written by [Hoa's
husband] Jacques Viellis and his friends." Chivas-Baron's consciousness of
the power invested in colonial writings is evident in Hoa's anger when she
comes across a particularly unflattering reportage on Annam: "The author
sees my country with an ill-natured eye: 'hideous flat stretches, mud; ignorant
natives, no art, no poetry, no history, no literature, no legends.' 'How,' I asked
M. Viellis, 'can the French like Indo-China after reading such books?'"42
</p><p>Even Viellis admits that the work in question is prejudiced, but not all
cases are so easily resolved. More subtly, Chivas-Baron narrates in literary
form the affectionate and sympathetic colonization of history we saw in
Pavie's Khmer ethnographies. This is manifested in Hoa's unworldliness, as
she frankly admits, "I have never been away from Hanoi except to make a
trip to Haiphong ... the life of Annamite peasants is absolutely unknown
to me." As French savants sought to preserve Angkor, and Pavie became the
keeper of Khmer epics, so "M. Jacques made fun of my ignorance; he was
amused that a Frenchman should inform me about these things."
</p><p>Nor is Hoa's story limited to a Frenchman having authority over Annamite
culture. By reading French studies, Hoa is educated about her homeland,
yet the consciousness arrives through the language and habits of her
husband, a colonial bureaucrat. While giving his wife riding and carriage
-lessons he exhorts her, "Yes, little Hoa, always farther, higher! That's the
essential characteristic of the French! Is your heart becoming daily a little
more French?" Here Viellis manages to instruct Hoa and assimilate her to
Frenchness, both within a context of marital affection. Viellis's marriage is
his colonial project, a means of expressing the authority of European empire
in the dynamics of a sentimental relationship. As he tells Hoa, "Admit that
the French are making efforts to understand and love your country, which
they think of as a new France."43 The "France of Asia" described by Bui-Thanh-
Van and Nguyen-An-Long is fully expressed in conjugality.
</p><p>Under colonialism, such marriages were ideological as well as affectionate
acts, and as such of great interest to the Hanoi administration. Civil
records show how the governor general's office involved itself directly in
validating or invalidating French and Vietnamese liaisons and marriages,
particularly those of administrative and military personnel. The residents
in Tonkin and Annam regularly sent reports up to the governor general's
office apprising the administration of "French citizens desiring to contract
marriage in the colony," along with files detailing requests of a "M. Jolly and
Mlle. Hoan-Thi-Kiêt," or a "M. Riberiro and the native woman Nguyên-Thi-
Lily, called Lucy."44 In such cases "understanding" a potential spouse
often meant a police report.
</p><p>Legitimate unions obeyed established criteria. In the case of a proposed
1918 marriage between a Captain Derepas and a Madame Duong Thi Mo,
the court at Hanoi sent the Attorney General a report favorably recommending
the union, considering "Derepas has lived ten years maritalement
with Duong Thi Mo; from this union have come four children." The report
fixed upon the respective duties of the couple: the woman's moral behavior
and reputation, and the man's financial support: "The best information has
been gathered on the morality of Duong Thi Mo, who has received, by the
way, a monthly stipend of 250 francs."45 In this context, the court found no
reason to object.
</p><p>Other cases did not sit so well. In the case of a Mademoiselle Cousy who
planned to marry one 0.1lach Van Giai in Toulouse, a police report from
Cochinchine maintained that the proposed husband "possesses, in effect,
a deplorable background: accused several times of theft and complicity to
theft and for assault and battery." Worse, he "is not engaged in any work,
and frequents houses of prostitution." To this the colonial administration
appended its advice, "the marriage he has projected with a Frenchwoman
cannot but cause misfortune if it is allowed to take place; I therefore have the
honor of requesting that you intervene on behalf of the department ... and
to prevent, if there is still time, the marriage that this native [indigene] has
projected with Mlle Cousy. "46 By the end of the report, only Mademoiselle
Cousy had a name. The administration frankly expressed its desire to intervene
in what it deemed unfavorable marriage projects, particularly where a
Frenchwoman was involved.
</p><p>Bui-Thanh-Van also recounted the case of a young Frenchwoman journeying
to Tourane and Faifo in 1921 in search of her Annamite husband
while bearing "the fruit of his love." Although sympathetically received by
the "yellow race" village and townspeople, "she came up against the intrigues
of her own compatriots who engaged themselves energetically to make it
impossible for her to achieve her purpose, essentially for the honor of prestige."
Beaten down and without resources, she returned to France. According
to Bui, "in the colony, the French marginalize their sisters who live under
the roof of a native person." Apparently mindful of his French audience
however, Bui then softened his report by concluding it as a timeless meditation
on love: "Love ... has always been alone and unique in its singular
domain across the centuries. It'-has lived, lives, will live by its own eternal
breath. "47 As Bui knew, there were limits to how much colonialism might
actually be expressed within the Empire of Love.
</p><p>Europeans also explored those limits. Frenchmen might love Indochina
and have their congaï, but the role of a Frenchwoman in the colonies was
to love France. In her critical essays on colonial living for la femme, Chivas-Baron
plainly stated from experience what she saw the Frenchwoman's role in
empire to be: the domestic reproduction of Gallic civilization. "She is ... the
one who, everywhere, creates France around her, with the habits of France
and the visions of France, with small objects and grand sentiments, with a
silver tea-service and Louis-Philippe lamps, with the grace and morale of
France, her goodness and courage. "48 The great allegorical drama of civilization
would be most effectively realized at the moment of its investment in
daily meanings and everyday objects.
</p><p>Such a presence was met with reservations by some colonials for whom
such domesticity had little role in their schemes of privilege. The scholar
Albert de Pouvourville articulated what would become a well-worn argument
about empire as it became formal colonialism in the twentieth century:
that European women had spoiled it with their excessive material and moral
refinements. "Comes the French feminine element bringing to our summary
interiors and to our once-again uncouth souls the enveloping charm of her
elegance and her preciousness." After this came the matter of the men's "lost
girls" and Frenchwomen's strong dislike of them, a hostility "ignoring without
doubt that in the traditional laws of Annam, temporary unions, with
repurchase, are valid." Chivas-Baron noted, "White women ... are not kind
to métisses. Some of them display a ferocious jealousy in this regard." Invoking
the loss of the "possession of the native," De Pouvourville bemoaned that
"an entire part of our work, and not the easiest, has been wiped out. Between
the white and yellow ... a deep trench has been dug, everyday aggravated by
the zeal of our pretty women."49
</p><p>De Pouvourville's "white and yellow" receives airing when, in "Madame
Hoa," Jacques Viellis is confronted by a French friend for paying too much
attention to his "congaï." He merely replies, "You alarm yourself friend; you
are mistaken. For me a Frenchwoman is always a Frenchwoman; an Annamite
an Annamite. I'm not yet in my second childhood. Don't get excited."
Hoa, overhearing, is astounded. "I listened no longer ... my heart is broken.
I can still hear the mocking voices laughing at our race. Oh, these Occidental
people. They talk of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Even their kindness is
disdainful. "50
</p><p>Directly invoking the term race, Chivas-Baron once again deftly displayed
how "marriage" obeyed the logic of ideology, and how affection circumscribed
the bounds of such race. In a practice directly familiar from
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti's</a> writings and liaisons, ideals of union and affinity flattered notions of
propriety while obscuring the double coercion of male to female and colonizer
to colonized. Here, romance delivers itself as a constituent element of
French authority in Indochina.
</p><p>In a complementary fashion, an anticolonial activist like Phan Bôi
Chau (186{1940) could lament in 1907 the French presence through his
own country's lack of a national romance. "It is true that Heaven has not
been kind to us. That is because our people have no mutual love or trust.
They treat one another as people from Qin and Yueh. Although of the same
race they treat each other as enemies." As the fictional Hoa, he excoriated
the colonizers, "They despise us claiming that we are weak; they lie to us
because they consider us stupid .... The moral prestige of hundreds of our
officials does not prevail over that of a French woman." Calling for a Vietnamese
nationalism, Phan pitted his patriotic solidarity against the haughty
charm of the foreigner: "When the people of our country have reached such
a mutual trust and affection, will our eyes still see any French gentlemen
around?"51 Playing out the promises and deceptions of political romance,
Phan, like Chivas-Baron, deftly underscored the conceits of a character like
Jacques Viellis, with his unstudied-and as yet unchallenged-romance of
cultural and racial superiority.
</p><p>What such contests ultimately disrupted are certain and essential notions
of racial difference operating under European authority. What Ann
Stoler has called the "tense and tender ties" of empire are extended in complex
ways to Madame Hoa's mixed-parentage cousin Ginette, who will have
a prosperous life married to a European, yet will also rage, "I am not an
Annamite, I am not a Frenchwoman. I am a half-breed ... that means a
creature held in contempt by both races to which I belong. "52 Again invoking
race, Chivas-Baron gives fictional and dramatic form to what, administratively,
became a critical cultural and civil status dilemma within the Empire
of Love, a theme she elaborates to tragic ends in Confidences de métisse. In
this novella, a young woman, half Asian, half European, searches for her
place in two worlds, neither of which will accept her: "I am one of pride,
whom life has humiliated." Daughter of a Vietnamese woman and a French
public works engineer who has 'since completed his duty "in the colonies,"
she sadly relates a "childhood unrolled at the edges of paternal existence,"
and as a young woman carries out a plan to find and torment her father for
marginalizing and abandoning her.
</p><p>Tracking down her father Lauzebert on a sea voyage-he unknowingly
tells her "no madame, no, I have no metis on my conscience"-she
reveals herself with bitter satisfaction. Stricken by guilt and the intensity
of her hatred, he staggers deranged before her, then falls "headfirst into
the waves. "53 The Ligue Maritime director Maurice Rondet-Saint assayed
the "marriage" results of France and Indochina with no more optimism.
"The metis, born of the unions of Frenchmen and native women, require
their own discussion ... their situation is assuredly, infinitely false." Such
children were "fatally brought to be incorporated in one or the other of
these two societies, within which there is no place." Colonial marriage, thus
empire, were hardly sites of Viellis's essential eastern/western dichotomies
but of endlessly produced conundrums and anxieties.
</p><p>The secure "type" of the congaï, or the writing of the "Annamite" colonial
subject were as unstable as topographical boundaries: earlier contests
over the marking of the Mekong or Red River were now transposed to
the sentiment and authority of intimate relations. Was the woman who
bore a metis a wife, mother, or servant-and what of the child? What if
the parents were unknown? When Charles Henry My attempted to claim
the status of a French citizen from his mixed parentage in 1919, the Ministry
of Justice issued an opinion on this "very delicate question," denying
the citizenship and arguing "the Court of Appeals of Indochina will have
already pronounced upon this in a judgment of May 28, 1903, by which
it has refused to recognize the status of French citizen to a metis for the
reason that the mother is a native [indigene]. "The Ministry then asked for
clarification on whether "in Indochina the natural child doesn't belong to
the mother when this is known in fact, even when she does not expressly
recognize her child. "54
</p><p>For the "native" and woman, status hinged upon the notion of "l'enfant
nature!." For the colonial and man, it rested upon the legal status of recognition,
declared in formal administrative documentation. This was underscored
in cases in which the man died, leaving his "congaï"' and children
without claims to any of his French legal privileges. In the case of a petition
brought by one Hai-L& after the sudden decease of a Captain Poirot, the
court declined her case, noting "no declaration of birth in the name of the
woman," and no trace "of an act of recognition drawn up at the request of
this officer." In similar cases in Annam, the father's lack of recognition made
the mother's "nature" determinate and found that "the child legally remains
Annamite. "55 Rondet-Saint made clear the dissonance involved in imagining
that nurture and right could be the same under colonialism: "Is it suitable
to leave [them] in the maternal milieu, or should the father educate the
children in such a way that they become members of French society, playing
for their rights as citizens?" Such uncertainties and questions in colonial
distinction would come to dominate twentieth-century and postcolonial
policy. 56
</p><p>Even when marriage was not the key figure for the romance of France
and Indochina, the production of "métis" identities was one of its most
striking outcomes. This was particularly true where vehement declarations
of love were the political currency between high levels of the colonial administration
and Francophile Vietnamese.
</p><p>For key French administrators, "romance" was as much policy as personal
sentiment. Governor General de Lanessan lobbied directly for an empire of
sincere loyalty and understanding: "We respect the religion and institutions
of these peoples we attempt to colonize. There we find a double advantage:
we thus gain their sympathies and their affection." In essay after essay he
repeated his point: the best way to "solidly seat the influence of France in
Indochina," was to literally "pacify" the country-not through conflict, but
by gaining "the sympathies of the population."57
</p><p>Governor General Albert Sarrault pursued a similar line. Letters from
colonial advisors led by Lê-Van-Trung at Saigon praised the governor for
his promises to protect and "elevate" Indochina, and offered, "these words
have entered into the hearts of all natives who have conceived for you a
true gratitude." At Sarrault's recall from the colony in 1916, local newspapers
such as La Cochinchine Liberate and the Midi Coloniale printed headlines citing
the displeasure of the Nghi-Viên delegates to the government, claiming
"Demonstrations of Love in Tonkin in Favor of Albert Sarrault. “The papers
attacked Cochinchine deputy Ernest Outrey for his criticism of Sarrault's
"pro-indigene" policies, citing the popularity of Sarrault's approach, and
insisting that "few can boast, for themselves to be so loved by the natives
as Monsieur Sarrault. Yes, Monseiur Outrey, loved by the natives, who are,
after all, in the millions."58
</p><p>No governor ever gained the affection of millions but, within particular
groups, the message and alliance ,worked effectively, creating political and
cultural metis with overlapping attachments. Annamite and Cochinchine
councillors implicated in the colonial administration were especially enthusiastic.
During the Great War in Europe, one such wrote to his son, "We
have still one non-equivocal duty of testimony to make: that is the affirmation
to the metropole of our respectful love and our solidarity." Nguyen Phan
Long would fictionalize such sensibilities in characters like his M. Minh
who tells a friend, "I love France as a second patrie." Among the mandarins,
the message of love and association was also well received and repeated.
One such mandarin, Trân-Tan-Binh, gained a trip to France and returned
to make a lecture in Hanoi in 1907 where he admonished his fellows, "The
French have come here to assume our protection; they live among us on the
same land ... they love us, they are our masters and friends, they undertake
all reforms to guide us toward progress and we do not seem to have put our
hearts into it. "59
</p><p>One who certainly did put his heart into it was the essayist Tran Van
Tung, whose Rêves d'un campagnard Annamite traces the self-conscious sentimental
education of a village boy longing for a French identity. Governor
General Jules Brévié wrote a preface describing "the obstinate ascent of a
little Annamite peasant toward what might be conveniently called Western
Civilization." The governor could hardly have asked for a more laudatory
text, for here love and ideology are remarkably aligned. As Tran put it:
"The France I love is that of all the Great Men ... how could I not love her
when she bears me all reasons to live, when my head is full of her thoughts,
when my heart is full of her sentiments?" This perfectly realized subject of
the Empire of Love further avowed, "This love that I have for you, for your
people, I want to keep it in all its purity, in all its freshness to communicate
it to my brothers, to my friends, to my readers ... to engrave in fiery letters
your well-loved names in the memories of all children of Annam." To
this enthusiastically pedagogical project Tran exulted, "0 my France, you
will never know how much I admire, respect, and love you. You will never
know all the depth of my love." This astonishingly romantic reverie even
had the author confessing, "My France, will you believe me now, if I tell
you quietly that I love you more than my own country, more than my little
Indochina?"
</p><p>But, still, the colonial shadow falls "between France and Indochina,
between dream and reality, I have hours full of melancholy and sadness."
Like a scorned or ridiculed lover Tran anguished, "I want to speak of my
love with men of my country, but no one listens." Worse perhaps, "I want
to speak of this love with my French brothers; they also, they do not wish
to hear ... this love I have for you ... it weighs so heavy, so heavy upon my
heart." Like the hybrid lives recorded in Chivas-Baron's fiction or French
legal archives, Tran found himself a sort of metis, struggling between worlds.
"I owe to my Indochine the shape of my body, the color of my hair, the tint
of my face ... but my consciousness, my thought, and my future, I owe them
to my beloved France." His sadness and frustration were not assuaged by
attempted reflections on his homeland of “numerous and beautiful pagodas,
beautiful monuments, the many picturesque landscapes." All he could think
was "Thank you my Great France with all my heart and soul for your precious
and generous gifts."60
</p><p>Such extraordinary declarations of love for France did not, of course, go
uncontested. The colonial critic, writer, and pamphleteer Nguyên-An-Ninh
derided the French "sentimental project" in 1925 and asserted, "Only
a band ... of former office boys raised by the colonial government to the
highest ranks, and Annamites detached from Confucian doctrine sing the
praises of the French domination." His work neatly complements Tran Van
Tung's, for he also reveres the Great Men of French letters, yet the lessons
he draws are strikingly different. Where Tran effervesced "my dear France is
that of writers, poets, and philosophers," and wished to sing his fervor to the
youth of Indochina, Nguyen claimed of the young generation, "they have
received from the hands of the French themselves the act of condemnation."
The colonials, he said, could not prevent young Vietnamese from reading
Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, "who preached the demand for basic
liberties which protect human dignity." It was these for which the young
people of his time yearned, "battling openly, in the name of humanitarian
ideals and the principles of 1789."
</p><p>In response to attacks that he was anti-French, Nguyen countered that
the supposed "force of love" between French and Vietnamese was in reality
a "force brutale" expressing the "pride and egoism" of a conqueror. As
for himself, he could make a distinction between his attachments: "Annamites 
shaped by French schools no longer have ... hatred of the conqueror,
but almost all are anti-colonial."61 Such contests would be most famously
manifested by Nguyen Tat Thanh, who in 19n sailed to Paris to study, and
spent subsequent decades writing, agitating, and negotiating between the
French, Chinese, Russians, and Japanese. Along the way he adopted the
alias Nguyen Ai Quoc, and finally took the name Ho Chi Minh.
</p><p>Vietnamese nationalists had some common cause with the inverted
romance presented by the writer and colonial critic Félicien Challayé,
who traveled in Indochina in 1901. Enraged by the insults and beatings
delivered by Europeans upon the local peoples, the Frenchman discovered
that "to protest against the cruelties one sees committed is to give proof of a
naive humanitarianism ... to be dishonored, even treasonous." Guardianship
presumed neither equality nor justice; demanding them was indulgence, the
wrong kind of humanitarianism. Challayé noted the frequent outrages committed
"with no motive, no pretext, simply for pleasure, or better as they say,
to 'maintain white prestige."' Calling on the republic to end the brutalities,
he concluded, "Only on this condition will cease to appear ironic, ridiculous,
and cruel the motto posted on the walls of the native schools: Love France
who Protects You."62
</p><p>Challenging that motto and those schools would not be easy. History
lessons in particular were tightly controlled in the name of the Empire of
Love. Professor Chau Kim Dang's 1930 textbook Leçons d'histoire d'Annam
showed no overt concession to Nguyen-An-Ninh's anticolonialism. The
text was, after all, approved by supervising history instructor Lieutenant
Colonel Bonifacy, whose preface announced, "I do not doubt that upon
reading it, your young students will gain from your lessons sentiments of
love and of recognition ... for those who, in the past, have prepared the
present, and that they will be fair to the France whose benevolent role they
will appreciate."
</p><p>The subsequent details of dynasties and chronologies of military actions
suggested an aggrieved France disciplining disobedient charges, as in 1862
Cochinchine where "at the end of his patience, Admiral de la Grandière was
compelled to resort to armed force." Yet intentional or not, Chau made clear
a logic of history that could resonate differently to different ears. As Nguyen
had claimed French philosophes and the legacies of 1789 for himself, so Chau
ambiguously advances: "The study of history develops above all patriotism.
In sharing, in effect, the joys and sorrows of one's ancestors, one loves them;
in loving them, one is attached henceforth to the land they inhabit, which
is our patrie."63
</p><p>Whose ancestors then, and love for what patrie? In 1913 La Depeche
Coloniale published a letter of "an Annamite from Hanoi" with a
striking and ambivalent announcement. Beginning "I love this country to
whom I owe life and death," the author gave the colonial government its
due, yet warned of a romance gone sour: "After so many promises not kept,
so many acts of kindness without result, the mass of the population, whatever
one says, is disappointed." The following year, the anticolonial leader
Nguyen-Chi-Binh took up arms against the supposedly well-loved Governor
Sarrault and paid with his life. Reports of his capture related that "he
pronounced, along the entire route from the place where he was interrogated
to the execution site, patriotic words to prove that he truly loved his Annamite
country and his compatriots." His final utterances directly confronted
the loving mothers and devoted brothers of French empire. "You, French,
you come to our home to take what I and my compatriots have for ourselves.
You chase use away, you kill us in order to assure your own happiness and
that of your own family. "64
</p><p>Other stories return us to the figure of ruins. Charles Lemire, one of the
first Southeast Asian scholars of the Ecole Française d’extrême orient
to argue for archaeological preservation in Indochina, suggested, "It is in
the traditions of France ... to attach herself to the historical memories left
by the peoples whom she dominates or protects." To him, protection and
domination were indivisible projects.65 In an 1891 survey of the French Indochinese
empire, the geographer Charles Meyniard reiterated sentiments we
have seen repeated across the Pacific-the notion that French empire was
uniquely heartfelt in nature: "What other people has ever left such memories
to subjugated races? ... they have kept for their first conquerors their
sympathies and their admiration." More, "what other has left in the hearts
of its former children a memory more devoted to the mother country, a
more solid attachment to its language, its spirit and its morals?" France alone
could provide enough history for her charges, those who would be devoted
children to her loving memory.
</p><p>The Duc de Montpensier, interested primarily in hunting and adventures,
also could not escape the essentialized rhetoric of a benign and compassionate
empire. Ruminating on the Moï peoples: "The important thing
is that these savages are penetrated by this thought, that the French are
goodhearted people who don't wish them any harm; on the contrary, they've
come among them to protect them from the persecutions of the Chinese
and the Annamites, and have no other desire than to improve their lot."66
Rounding out the Duc de Montpensier's paternalism in historical time,
Charles Lemire concluded "'protection' does not apply only to people, but
extends to the genius of disappeared or fallen races." He, like the Ecole
Française d’extrême orient, like Auguste Pavie, would keep the ancestors.
This brought the question of romance and ruins full circle: Indochina would
be taken unto love, as with Bui, Nguyen, Pavie, or Chivas-Baron, or unto
death, as with Garnier or <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a>. But as' she was created and possessed, so she
could always and henceforth could only live through France.
</p><p>In an 1879 ethnographic study of Le Royaume d'Annam et les Annamites,
J. L. Dureuil de Rhins had suggested such a trajectory across the millennia
of Southeast Asia unto the coming of the French. The Annamites, he
pointed out, had themselves been conquerors of the local peoples, and it
was upon their conquest that the very kingdom of Annam was founded.
Yet, notably, "the conquests left nothing in the landscape but ruins, upon
which they raised not a state flourishing by commerce and industry, but
their domination." In surveying the ancient remainders of their triumph, the
Annamites were unaware that "each nation seems to have an unconscious
role to play in the general development of progress, and that of Annam will
have been to prepare the road for new conquerors who would extend, upon
a more unified land, the benefits of modern civilization. "67
</p><p>The conquerors wrote of monuments while creating blackened landscapes.
In the novella Thi-Vinh by Clotilde Chivas-Baron, a young heroine
on her first voyage to the capital is filled with strange visions of the
roadside, of the passing landscape littered with "rusted cannons," and "abandoned
pagodas whose stones are blackened by fire." In measured and melancholy
tones, her father gestures out over the twilight visions, "these ruins
my daughter are the work of the French, and one of these encampments is
theirs. In our faraway province you have had no contact with this great race
of the West. You will see in the capital many things that will surprise you,
others that will amuse you, and others still that will bring suffering to your
Annamite soul. "68
</p><p>At Angkor, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Pierre Loti</a> described ponderous Khmer temples taken by
the jungle. Chivas-Baron disdained such exoticism and displayed the ruins
of the Annamite kingdom as the deliberate carnage of French occupation
and gunboat firepower. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">Loti</a> himself underscored this common project in his
other writings-his journalistic reports of French attacks in Annam: "The
shells have caused another fire, a magnificent one, this village, pagoda, everything
burning with immense red flames ... all along the coast can be seen
the glare of Annamite villages, which burn in the moonlight until morning."
Fleeing the French attacks, Hue regent Ton That Thuyet wept, "one looks
back toward the palace ruined in the hour of the snake. The French have
raised their banner."69 J. L. Dureuil de Rhins's ethnographic tale contained
no traces of irony about historical succession, and none would likely have
occurred to him from his privileged colonial vantage. Still, he might have
known that the new conquerors would bear not only the romance of civilization
but also their own purposeful talent for ruins.
