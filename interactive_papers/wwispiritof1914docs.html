Avevamo lungamente calpestata su opulenti tappeti orientali la nostra atavica accidia, discutendo davanti ai confini estremi della logica ed annerendo molta carta di frenetiche scritture.<br><br>Un immenso orgoglio gonfiava i nostri petti, poichè ci sentivamo soli, in quell’ora, ad esser desti e ritti, come fari superbi o come sentinelle avanzate, di fronte all’esercito delle stelle nemiche, occhieggianti dai loro celesti accampamenti. Soli coi fuochisti che s’agitano davanti ai forni infernali delle grandi navi, soli coi neri fantasmi che frugano nelle pance arroventate delle locomotive lanciate a pazza corsa, soli cogli ubriachi annaspanti, con un incerto batter d’ali, lungo i muri della città.<br><br>Sussultammo ad un tratto, all’udire il rumore formidabile degli enormi tramvai a due piani, che passano sobbalzando, risplendenti di luci multicolori, come i villaggi in festa che il Po straripato squassa e sradica d’improvviso, per trascinarli fino al mare, sulle cascate e attraverso i gorghi di un diluvio.<br><br>Poi il silenzio divenne pi cupo. Ma mentre ascoltavamo l’estenuato borbotto, di preghiere del vecchio canale e lo scricchiolar dell’ossa dei palazzi moribondi sulle loro barbe di umida verdura, noi udimmo subitamente ruggire sotto le finestre gli automobili famelici.<br><br>“Andiamo,” diss’io, “andiamo, amici! Partiamo! Finalmente, la mitologia e l’ideale mistico sono superati. Noi stiamo per assistere alla nascita del Centauro e presto vedremo volare i primi Angeli!… Bisognerà scuotere le porte della vita per provarne i cardini e i chiavistelli!… Partiamo! Ecco, sulla terra, la primissima aurora! Non v’ cosa che agguagli lo splendore della rossa spada del sole che schermeggia per la prima volta nelle nostre tenebre millenarie! … ”<br><br>Ci avvicinammo alle tre belve sbuffanti, per palparne amorosamente i torridi petti. lo mi stesi sulla mia macchina come un cadavere nella bara, ma subito risuscitai sotto il volante, lama di ghigliottina che minacciava il mio stomaco.<br><br>La furente scopa della pazzia ci strappa a noi stessi e ci cacci attraverso le vie, scoscese e profonde come letti di torrenti. Qua e l una lampada malata, dietro i vetri d’una finestra, c’insegnava a disprezzare la fallace matematica dei nostri occhi perituri.<br><br>Io gridai: Il fiuto, il fiuto solo, basta alle belve!<br><br>E noi, come giovani leoni, inseguivamo la Morte, dal pelame nero maculato di pallide croci, che correva via pel vasto cielo violaceo, vivo e palpitante.<br><br>Eppure non avevamo un’Amante ideale che ergesse fino alle nuvole la sua sublime figura, n una Regina crudele a cui offrire le nostre salme, contorte a guisa di anelli bisantini! Nulla, per voler morire, se non il desiderio di liberarci finalmente dal nostro coraggio troppo pesante!<br><br>E noi correvamo schiacciando su le soglie delle case i cani da guardia che si arrotondavano, sotto i nostri pneumatici scottanti, come solini sotto il ferro da stirare. La Morte, addomesticata, mi sorpassava ad ogni svolto, per porgermi la zampa con grazia, e a quando a quando si stendeva a terra con un rumore di mascelle stridenti, mandandomi, da ogni pozzanghera, sguardi vellutati e carezzevoli.<br><br>“Usciamo dalla saggezza come da un orribile guscio, e gettiamoci, come frutti pimentati d’orgoglio, entro la bocca immensa e trita del vento!… Diamoci in pasto all’Ignoto, non gi per disperazione, ma soltanto per colmare i profondi pozzi dell’Assurdo! ”<br><br>Avevo appena pronunziate queste parole, quando girai bruscamente su me stesso, con la stessa ebrietà folle dei cani che voglion mordersi la coda, ed ecco ad un tratto venirmi incontro due ciclisti, che mi diedero torto, titubando davanti a me come due ragionamenti, entrambi persuasivi e nondimeno contradittorii. Il loro stupido dilemma discuteva sul mio terreno… Che noia! Auff!… Tagliai corto, e, pel disgusto, mi scaraventai colle ruote all’aria in un fossato…<br><br>Oh! materno fossato, quasi pieno di un’acqua fangosa! Bel fossato d’officina! lo gustai avidamente la tua melma fortificante, che mi ricorda la santa mammella nera della mia nutrice sudanese… Quando mi sollevai – cencio sozzo e puzzolente – di sotto la macchina capovolta, io mi sentii attraversare il cuore, deliziosamente, dal ferro arroventato della gioia!<br><br>Una folla di pescatori armati di lenza e di naturalisti podagrosi tumultuava gi intorno al prodigio. Con cura paziente e meticolosa, quella gente dispose alte armature ed enormi reti di ferro per pescare il mio automobile, simile ad un gran pescecane arenato. La macchina emerse lentamente dal fosso, abbandonando nel fondo, come squame, la sua pesante carrozzeria di buon senso e le sue morbide imbottiture di comodità.<br><br>Credevano che fosse morto, il mio bel pescecane, ma una mia carezza basta a rianimarlo, ed eccolo risuscitato, eccolo in corsa, di nuovo, sulle sue pinne possenti!<br><br>Allora, col volto coperto della buona melma delle officine – impasto di scorie metalliche, di sudori inutili, di fuliggini celesti – noi, contusi e fasciate le braccia ma impavidi, dettammo le nostre prime volontà a tutti gli uomini vivi della terra:<br><br>Manifesto del futurismo 1. Noi vogliamo cantare l’amor del pericolo, l’abitudine all’energia e alla temerità.<br><br>2. Il coraggio, l’audacia, la ribellione, saranno elementi essenziali della nostra poesia.<br><br>3. La letteratura esalta fino ad oggi l’immobilità pensosa, l’estasi e il sonno. Noi vogliamo esaltare il movimento aggressivo, l’insonnia febbrile, il passo di corsa, il salto mortale, lo schiaffo ed il pugno.<br><br>4. Noi affermiamo che la magnificenza del mondo si arricchita di una bellezza nuova: la bellezza della velocità. Un automobile da corsa col suo cofano adorno di grossi tubi simili a serpenti dall’alito esplosivo… un automobile ruggente, che sembra correre sulla mitraglia, pi bello della Vittoria di Samotracia.<br><br>5. Noi vogliamo inneggiare all’uomo che tiene il volante, la cui asta ideale attraversa la Terra, lanciata a corsa, essa pure, sul circuito della sua orbita.<br><br>6. Bisogna che il poeta si prodighi, con ardore, sfarzo e munificenza, per aumentare l’entusiastico fervore degli elementi primordiali.<br><br>7. Non v’ pi bellezza, se non nella lotta. Nessuna opera che non abbia un carattere aggressivo puo essere un capolavoro. La poesia deve essere concepita come un violento assalto contro le forze ignote, per ridurle a prostrarsi davanti all’uomo.<br><br>8. Noi siamo sul promontorio estremo dei secoli!… Perchè dovremmo guardarci alle spalle, se vogliamo sfondare le misteriose porte dell’Impossibile? Il Tempo e lo Spazio morirono ieri. Noi viviamo gi nell’assoluto, poichè abbiamo gi creata l’eterna velocit onnipresente.<br><br>9. Noi vogliamo glorificare la guerra – sola igiene del mondo – il militarismo, il patriottismo, il gesto distruttore dei libertari, le belle idee per cui si muore e il disprezzo della donna.<br><br>10. Noi vogliamo distruggere i musei, le biblioteche, le accademie d’ogni specie, e combattere contro il moralismo, il femminismo e contro ogni viltà opportunistica o utilitaria.<br><br>11. Noi canteremo le grandi folle agitate dal lavoro, dal piacere o dalla sommossa: canteremo le maree multicolori o polifoniche delle rivoluzioni nelle capitali moderne; canteremo il vibrante fervore notturno degli arsenali e dei cantieri incendiati da violente lune elettriche; le stazioni ingorde, divoratrici di serpi che fumano; le officine appese alle nuvole pei contorti fili dei loro fumi; i ponti simili a ginnasti giganti che scavalcano i fiumi, balenanti al sole con un luccichio di coltelli; i piroscafi avventurosi che fiutano l’orizzonte, le locomotive dall’ampio petto, che scalpitano sulle rotaie, come enormi cavalli d’acciaio imbrigliati di tubi, e il volo scivolante degli aeroplani, la cui elica garrisce al vento come una bandiera e sembra applaudire come una folla entusiasta.<br><br>E’ dall’Italia, che noi lanciamo pel mondo questo nostro manifesto di violenza travolgente e incendiaria, col quale fondiamo oggi il “Futurismo”, perchè vogliamo liberare questo paese dalla sua fetida cancrena di professori, d’archeologhi, di ciceroni e d’antiquarii.<br><br>Già per troppo tempo l’Italia stata un mercato di rigattieri. Noi vogliamo liberarla dagl’innumerevoli musei che la coprono tutta di cimiteri innumerevoli.<br><br>Musei: cimiteri!… Identici, veramente, per la sinistra promiscuità di tanti corpi che non si conoscono. Musei: dormitori pubblici in cui si riposa per sempre accanto ad esseri odiati o ignoti! Musei: assurdi macelli di pittori e scultori che varino trucidandosi ferocemente a colpi di colori e di linee, lungo le pareti contese!<br><br>Che ci si vada in pellegrinaggio, una volta all’anno, come si va al Camposanto nel giorno dei morti… ve lo concedo. Che una volta all’anno sia deposto un omaggio di fiori davanti alla Gioconda, ve lo concedo… Ma non ammetto che si conducano quotidianamente a passeggio per i musei le nostre tristezze, il nostro fragile coraggio, la nostra morbosa inquietudine. Perchè volersi avvelenare? Perchè volere imputridire?<br><br>E che mai si può vedere, in un vecchio quadro, se non la faticosa contorsione dell’artista, che si sforza di infrangere le insuperabili barriere opposte al desiderio di esprimere interamente il suo sogno?… Ammirare un quadro antico equivale a versare la nostra sensibilità in un’urna funeraria, invece di proiettarla lontano, in violenti getti di creazione e di azione.<br><br>Volete dunque sprecare tutte le forze migliori, in questa eterna ed inutile ammirazione del passato, da cui uscite fatalmente esausti, diminuiti e calpesti?<br><br>In verità io vi dichiaro che la frequentazione quotidiana dei musei, delle biblioteche e delle accademie (cimiteri di sforzi vani, calvarii di sogni crocifissi, registri di slanci troncati! … ), per gli artisti, altrettanto dannosa che la tutela prolungata dei parenti per certi giovani ebbri del loro ingegno e della loro volontà ambiziosa. Per i moribondi, per gl’infermi, pei prigionieri, sia pure: – l’ammirabile passato forse un balsamo ai loro mali, poichè per essi l’avvenire sbarrato… Ma noi non vogliamo pi saperneù, del passato, noi, giovani e forti futuristi!<br><br>E vengano dunque, gli allegri incendiarii dalle dita carbonizzate! Eccoli! Eccoli!… Suvvia! date fuoco agli scaffali delle biblioteche!… Sviate il corso dei canali, per inondare i musei!… Oh, la gioia di veder galleggiare alla deriva, lacere e stinte su quelle acque, le vecchie tele gloriose!… Impugnate i picconi, le scuri, i martelli e demolite senza pietà le città venerate!<br><br>I più anziani fra noi, hanno trent’anni: ci rimane dunque almeno un decennio, per compier l’opera nostra. Quando avremo quarant’anni, altri uomini più giovani e più validi di noi, ci gettino pure nel cestino, come manoscritti inutili. Noi lo desideriamo!<br><br>Verranno contro di noi, i nostri successori; verranno di lontano, da ogni parte, danzando su la cadenza alata dei loro primi canti, protendendo dita adunche di predatori, e fiutando caninamente, alle porte delle accademie, il buon odore delle nostre menti in putrefazione, già promesse alle catacombe delle biblioteche.<br><br>Ma noi non saremo là… Essi ci troveranno alfine – una notte d’inverno – in aperta campagna, sotto una triste tettoia tamburellata da una pioggia monotona, e ci vedranno accoccolati accanto ai nostri aeroplani trepidanti e nell’atto di scaldarci le mani al fuocherello meschino che daranno i nostri libri d’oggi fiammeggiando sotto il volo delle nostre immagini.<br><br>Essi tumultueranno intorno a noi, ansando per angoscia e per dispetto, e tutti, esasperati dal nostro superbo, instancabile ardire, si avventeranno per ucciderci, spinti da un odio tanto pi implacabile in quanto che i loro cuori saranno ebbri di amore e di ammirazione per noi.<br><br>La forte e sana Ingiustizia scoppierà radiosa nei loro occhi. – L’arte, infatti, non può essere che violenza, crudeltà ed ingiustizia.<br><br>I più anziani fra noi hanno trent’anni: eppure, noi abbiamo già sperperati tesori, mille tesori di forza, di amore, d’audacia, d’astuzia e di rude volontà; li abbiamo gettati via impazientemente, in furia, senza contare, senza mai esitare, senza riposarci mai, a perdifiato… Guardateci! Non siamo ancora spossati! I nostri cuori non sentono alcuna stanchezza, poichè sono nutriti di fuoco, di odio e di velocità!… Ve ne stupite?… E logico, poichè voi non vi ricordate nemmeno di aver vissuto! Ritti sulla cima del mondo, noi scagliamo una volta ancora, la nostra sfida alle stelle!<br><br>Ci opponete delle obiezioni?… Basta! Basta! Le conosciamo… Abbiamo capito!… La nostra bella e mendace intelligenza ci afferma che noi siamo il riassunto e il prolungamento degli avi nostri. – Forse!… Sia pure!… Ma che importa? Non vogliamo intendere!… Guai a chi ci ripeterà queste parole infami!…<br><br>Alzare la testa!…Ritti sulla cima del mondo, noi scagliamo, una volta ancora, la nostra sfida alle stelle!…'); break;
			case 2: $("div#commentary").html('Fondation et Manifeste du Futurisme<br><br>Nous avions veillé toute la nuit, mes amis et moi, sous des lampes de mosquée dont les coupoles de cuivre aussi ajourées que notre âme avaient pourtant des cœurs électriques. Et tout en piétinant notre native paresse sur d’opulents tapis Persans, nous avions discuté aux frontières extrêmes de la logique et griffé le papier de démentes écritures.<br><br>Un immense orgueil. gonflait nos poitrines, à nous sentir debout tout seuls, comme des phares ou comme des sentinelles avancées, face à l’armée des étoiles ennemies, qui campent dans leurs bivouacs célestes. Seuls avec les mécaniciens dans les infernales chaufferies des grands navires, seuls avec les noirs fantômes qui fourragent dans le ventre rouge des locomotives affolées, seuls avec les ivrognes battant des ailes contre les murs!<br><br>Et nous voilà brusquement distraits par le roulement des énormes tram¬ways à double étage, qui passent sursautants, bariolés de lumières, tels les hameaux en fate que le Pô débordé ébranle tout à coup et déracine, pour les entraîner, sur les cascades et les remous d’un déluge, jusqu’à la mer.<br><br>Puis le silence s’aggrava. Comme nous écoutions la prière exténuée du vieux canal et crisser les os des palais moribonds dans leur barbe de verdure, soudain rugirent sous nos fenêtres les automobiles affamées.<br><br>– Allons, dis-je, mes amis ! Partons ! Enfin la Mythologie et l’Idéal mystique sont surpassés.<br><br>Nous allons assister à la naissance du Centaure et nous verrons bientôt voler les premiers Anges ! Il faudra ébranler les portes de la vie pour en essayer les gonds et les verrous !… Partons! Voilà bien le pre¬mier soleil levant sur la terre !… Rien n’égale la splendeur de son épée rouge qui s’escrime pour la première fois, dans nos ténèbres millénaires.<br><br>Nous nous approchâmes des trois machines renâclantes pour flatter leur poitrail. Je m’allongeai sur la mienne comme un cadavre dans sa bière, mais je ressuscitai soudain sous le volant – couperet de guillotine – qui menaçait mon estomac.<br><br>Le grand balai de la folie nous arracha à nous-mêmes et nous poussa à travers les rues escarpées et profondes comme des torrents desséchés. Ça et là des lampes malheureuses, aux fenêtres, nous enseignaient à mépriser nos yeux mathématiques.<br><br>– Le flair, cri ai-je, le flair suffit aux fauves!…<br><br>Et nous chassions, tels de jeunes lions, la Mort au pelage noir tacheté de croix pâles, qui courait devant nous dans le vaste ciel mauve, palpable et vivant.<br><br>Et pourtant nous n avions pas de Maîtresse idéale dressant sa taille jus¬qu’aux nuages, ni de Reine cruelle à qui offrir nos cadavres tordus en bagues byzantines !… Rien pour mourir si ce n’est le désir de nous débarrasser enfin de notre trop pesant courage!<br><br>Nous allions écrasant sur le seuil des maisons les chiens de garde, qui s’aplatissaient arrondis sous nos pneus brûlants, comme un faux-col sous un fer à repasser.<br><br>La Mort amadouée me devançait à chaque virage pour m’offrir gentiment la patte, et tour à tour se couchait au ras de terre avec un bruit de mâchoires stridentes en me coulant des regards veloutés au fond des flaques.<br><br>– Sortons de la Sagesse comme d’une gangue hideuse et entrons, comme des fruits pimentés d’orgueil, dans la bouche immense et torse du vent !… Donnons-nous à manger à l’Inconnu, non par désespoir, mais simplement pour enrichir les insondables réservoirs de l’Absurde.<br><br>Comme j’avais dit ces mots, je virai brusquement sur moi-même avec l’ivresse folle des caniches qui se mordent la queue, et voilà tout à coup que deux cyclistes me désapprouvèrent, titubant devant moi ainsi que deux raison¬nements persuasifs et pourtant contradictoires. Leur ondoiement stupide discu¬tait sur mon terrain… Quel ennui! Pouah !… Je coupai court, et par dégoût, je me flanquai – vlan! – cul pardessus tête, dans un fossé…<br><br>Oh, maternel fossé, à moitié plein d’une eau vaseuse ! Fossé d’usine ! J’ai savouré a pleine bouche ta boue fortifiante qui me rappelle la sainte mamelle noire de ma nourrice soudanaise!<br><br>Comme je dressai mon corps, fangeuse et malodorante vadrouille, je sentis le fer rouge de la joie me percer délicieusement le cœur.<br><br>Une foule de pêcheurs à la ligne et de naturalistes podagres s’était ameutée d’épouvante autour du prodige. D’une âme patiente et tatillonne, ils élevèrent très haut d’énormes éperviers de fer, pour pêcher mon automobile, pareille à un grand requin embourbé. Elle émergea lentement en abandonnant dans le fossé, telles des écailles, Sa lourde carrosserie de bon sens et son capitonnage de confort.<br><br>On le croyait mort, mon bon requin, mais je le réveillai d’une seule caresse sur son dos tout-puissant, et le voilà ressuscité, courant à toute vitesse sur ses nageoires.<br><br>Alors, le visage masqué de la bonne boue des usines, pleine de scories de métal, de sueurs inutiles et de suie céleste, portant nos bras foulés en écharpe, parmi la complainte des sages pécheurs à la ligne et des naturalistes navrés, nous dictames nos premières volontés à tous les hommes vivants de la terre:<br><br>1. Nous voulons chanter l’amour du danger, l’habitude de l’énergie et de la témérité.<br><br>2. Les éléments essentiels de notre poésie seront. le courage, l’audaoe et la révolte.<br><br>3. La littérature ayant jusqu’ici magnifié l’immobilité pensive, l’extase et le sommeil, nous voulons exalter le mouvement agressif, l’insomnie fiévreuse, le pas gymnastique, le saut périlleux, la gifle et le coup de poing.<br><br>4. Nous déclarons que la splendeur du monde s’est enrichie d’une beauté nouvelle la beauté de la vitesse. Une automobile de course avec son coffre orné de gros tuyaux tels des serpents à l’haleine explosive… Une automobile rugissante, qui a l’air de courir sur de la mitraille, est plus belle que la Victoire de Samothrace.<br><br>5. Nous voulons chanter l’homme qui tient le volant, dont la tige idéale traverse la Terre, lancée elle-même sur le circuit de son orbite.<br><br>6. Il faut que le poète se dépense avec chaleur, éclat et prodigalité, pour augmenter la ferveur enthousiaste des éléments primordiaux.<br><br>7. Il n’y a plus de beauté que dans la lutte. Pas de chef-d’œuvre sans un caractère agressif. La poésie doit être un assaut violent contre les forces inconnues, pour les sommer de se coucher devant l’homme.<br><br>8. Nous sommes sur le promontoire extrême des siècles !… A quoi bon regarder derrière nous, du moment qu’il nous faut défoncer les vantaux mysté¬rieux de l’Impossible? Le Temps et l’Espace sont morts hier. Nous vivons déjà dans l’absolu, puisque nous avons déjà créé l’éternelle vitesse omniprésente.<br><br>9. Nous voulons glorifier la guerre – seule hygiène du monde, – le militarisme, le patriotisme, le geste destructeur des anarchistes, les belles Idées qui tuent, et le mépris de la femme.<br><br>10. Nous voulons démolir les musées, les bibliothèques, combattre le moralisme, le féminisme et toutes les lâchetés opportunistes et utilitaires.<br><br>11. Nous chanterons les grandes foules agitées par le travail, le plaisir ou la révolte; les ressacs multicolores et polyphoniques des révolutions dans les capitales modernes; la vibration nocturne des arsenaux et des chantiers sous leurs violentes lunes électriques; les gares gloutonnes avaleuses de serpents qui fument; les usines suspendues aux nuages par les ficelles de leurs fumées; les ponts aux bonds de gymnastes lancés sur la coutellerie diabolique des fleuves ensoleillés; les paquebots aventureux flairant l’horizon; les locomotives au grand poitrail, qui piaffent sur les rails, tels d’énormes chevaux d’acier bridés de longs tuyaux, et le vol glissant des aéroplanes, dont l’hélice a des claque¬ments de drapeau et des applaudissements de foule enthousiaste.<br><br>C’est en Italie que nous lançons ce manifeste de violence culbutante et incendiaire, par lequel nous fondons aujourd’hui le Futurisme, parce que nous voulons délivrer l’Italie de Sa gangrène de professeurs, d’archéologues, de cicé¬rones et d’antiquaires.<br><br>L’Italie a été trop longtemps le grand marché des brocanteurs. Nous vou¬Ions le débarrasser des musées innombrables qui la couvrent d’innombrables cimetières.<br><br>Musées, cimetières!… Identiques vraiment dans leur sinistre coudoiement de corps qui ne se connaissent pas. Dortoirs publics où l’on dort à jamais côte à côte avec des êtres hais ou inconnus. Férocité réciproque des peintres et des sculpteurs s’entre-tuant à coups de lignes et de couleurs dans le même musée.<br><br>Qu’on y fasse une visite chaque année comme on va voir ses morts une fois par an… Nous pouvons bien l’admettre !… Qu’on dépose même des fleurs une fois par an aux pieds de la Joconde, nous le concevons !… Mais que l’on aille promener quotidiennement dans les musées nos tristesses, nos courages fragiles et notre inquiétude, nous ne l’admettons pas!..<br><br>Voulez-vous donc vous empoisonner? Voulez-vous donc pourrir?<br><br>Que peut-on bien trouver dans un vieux tableau si ce n’est la contorsion pénible de l’artiste s’efforçant de briser les barrières infranchissables à son désir d’exprimer entièrement son rêve ?<br><br>Admirer un vieux tableau c’est verser notre sensibilité dans une urne funé¬raire, au lieu de la lancer en avant par jets violents de création et d’action. Voulez-vous donc gâcher ainsi vos meilleures forces dans une admiration inutile du passé, dont vous sortez forcément épuisés, amoindris, piétinés ?<br><br>En vérité la fréquentation quotidienne des musées, des bibliothèques et des académies (ces cimetières d’efforts perdus, ces calvaires de rêves crucifiés, ces registres d’élans brisés!…) est pour les artistes ce qu’est la tutelle prolongée des parents pour des jeunes gens intelligents, ivres de leur talent et de leur volonté ambitieuse.<br><br>Pour des moribonds, des invalides et des prisonniers, passe encore. C’est peut être un baume à leurs blessures que l’admirable passé, du moment que l’avenir leur est interdit… Mais nous n’en voulons pas, nous, les jeunes, les forts et les vivants futuristes !<br><br>Viennent donc les bons incendiaires aux doigts carbonisés!… Les voici! Les voici!… Et boutez donc le feu aux rayons des bibliothèques! Détournez le cours des canaux pour inonder les caveaux des musées!… Oh qu’elles nagent à la dérive, les toiles glorieuses! A vous les pioches et les marteaux! Sapez les fondements des villes vénérables!<br><br>Les plus âgés d’entre nous ont trente ans; nous avons donc au moins dix ans pour accomplir notre tache. Quand nous aurons quarante ans, que de plus jeunes et plus vaillants que nous veuillent bien nous jeter au panier comme des manuscrits inutiles !… Ils viendront contre nous de très loin, de partout, en bondissant sur la cadence légère de leurs premiers poèmes, griffant l’air de leur’ s doigts crochus, et humant, aux portes des académies, la bonne odeur de nos esprits pourrissants, déjà promis aux catacombes des bibliothèques.<br><br>Mais nous ne serons pas là. Ils nous trouveront enfin, par un nuit d’hiver, en pleine campagne, sous un triste hangar pianoté par la pluie monotone, accroupis près de nos aéroplanes trépidants, en train de chauffer nos mains sur le misérable feu que feront nos livres d’aujourd’hui flambant gaiement sous le vol étincelant de leurs images.<br><br>Ils s’ameuteront autour de nous, haletants d’angoisse et de dépit, et tous exaspérés par notre fier courage infatigable s’élanceront pour nous tuer, avec d’autant plus de haine que leur cœur sera ivre d’amour et d’admiration pour nous. Et la forte et la saine Injustice éclatera radieusement dans leurs yeux. Car l’art ne peut être que violence, cruauté et injustice.<br><br>Les plus âgés d’entre nous ont trente ans, et pourtant nous avons déjà gaspillé des trésors, des trésors de force, d’amour, de courage et d’âpre volonté, à la hâte, en délire, sans compter, à tour de bras, à perdre haleine.<br><br>Regardez-nous! Nous ne sommes pas essoufflés… Notre cœur n’a pas la moindre fatigue! Car il s’est nourri de feu, de haine et de vitesse !… Ça vous étonne? C’est que vous ne vous souvenez même pas d’avoir vécu! Debout sur la cime du monde, nous lançons encore une fois le défi aux étoiles!<br><br>Vos objections? Assez! Assez! Je les connais! C’est entendu! Nous savons bien ce que notre belle et fausse intelligence nous affirme. – Nous ne sommes, dit-elle, que le résumé et le prolongement de nos ancêtres. – Peut-être! Soit!… Qu’importe?… Mais nous ne voulons pas entendre! Gardez-vous de répéter ces mots infâmes! Levez plutôt la tête!<br><br>Debout sur la cime du monde, nous lançons encore une fois le défi aux étoiles!<br><br>'); break;

CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
THE FIRST HOURS OF THE WAR OF 1914<br>
<br>
THE summer of 1914 would have been memorable for us even
without the doom which it spread over the European earth. I
had rarely experienced one more luxuriant, more beautiful and, I
am tempted to say, more summery. Throughout the days and
nights the heavens were a silky blue, the air soft yet not sultry, the
meadows fragrant and warm, the forests dark and profuse in their
tender green; even today, when I use the word summer, I think
involuntarily of those radiant July days which I spent in Baden
near Vienna. In order that I might concentrate on my work I had
retired for the month of July to this small romantic town where
Beethoven loved to spend his summer holidays, planning to pass
the remainder of the season with my honoured friend Verhaeren,
in his little country house in Belgium. In Baden one does not have
to leave the city to enjoy the country. The lovely, hilly forest
insinuates itself between the low Biedermeier houses which have
retained the simplicity and the charm of the Beethoven period. At
all the cafés and restaurants one sat in the open and could mingle at
pleasure with the light-hearted visitors who strolled about the
Kurpark, or could slip into a solitary path.<br>
<br>
Already on the eve of that twenty-ninth of June, which Catholic
Austria celebrates as the feastday of Saints Peter and Paul, many
guests had arrived from Vienna. In light summer dress, gay and
carefree, the crowds moved about to the music in the park. The
day was mild; a cloudless sky lay over the broad chestnut trees;
it was a day made to be happy. The holiday season would soon
set in for the people and children, and on this day they anticipated
the entire summer, with its fresh air, its lush green, and the forgetting
of all daily cares. I was sitting at some distance from the
crowd in the park, reading a book-I still remember that it was
Merejkovsky’s <i>Tolstoy and Dostoievsky</i>-and I read with interest and
attention. Nevertheless, I was simultaneously aware of the wind in
the trees, the chirping of the birds, and the music which was wafted
toward me from the park. I heard the melodies distinctly without
being disturbed by them, for our ear is so capable of adapting itself
that a continuous din, or the noise of a street, or the rippling of
a brook adjusts itself completely to our consciousness, and it is only
an unexpected halt in the rhythm that startles us into listening.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.168)</b> And so it was that I suddenly stopped reading when the music
broke off abruptly. I did not know what piece the band was
playing. I noticed only that the music had broken off. Instinctively
I looked up from my book. The crowd which strolled through
the trees as a single, light, moving mass, also seemed to have undergone
a change; it, too, had suddenly come to a halt. Something
must have happened. I got up and saw saw the musicians had left
their pavilion. This too was strange, for the park concert usually
lasted for an hour or more. What could have caused this brusque
conclusion? Coming closer I noticed that the people had crowded
excitedly round the bandstand because of an announcement which
had evidently just been put up. It was, as I soon learned, the text
of a telegram announcing that His Imperial Highness, the successor
to the crown, Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, who had gone to the
manoeuvres in Bosnia, had been assassinated there.<br>
<br>
More and more people pressed toward the placard; the unexpected
news was passed on from one to the other. But to be
honest, there was no particular shock or dismay to be seen on their
faces, for the heir-apparent was not at all well liked. From the very
earliest days of my youth I can recall another day when Crown
Prince Rudolf, the Emperor's only son, had been found shot dead in
Mayerling. Then the whole city was in a tmnult of despair and
excitement, tremendous crowds thronged to witness his lying-in-state,
the expression of shock and sympathy for the Emperor was
overwhelming, that his only son and heir, who had been looked
upon as an unusually progressive and humane Habsburg of whom
much was expected, had passed on in the prime of life. But Franz
Ferdinand lacked everything that counts for real popularity in
Austria; amiability, personal charm and easy-goingness. I had
often seen him in the theatre. There he sat in his box, broad and
mighty, with cold, fixed gaze, never casting a single friendly glance
towards the audience or encouraging the actors with hearty applause.
He was never seen to smile, and no photographs showed
him relaxed. He had no sense for music, and no sense of humour,
and his wife was equally unfriendly. They were surrounded by
an icy air; one knew that they had no friends, and also that the
old Emperor hated him with all his heart because he did not have
sufficient tact to hide his impatience to succeed to the throne. My
almost mystic premonition that some misfortune would come from
this man with his bulldog neck and his cold, scaring eyes, was by
no means a personal one but was shared by the entire nation; and
so the news of his murder aroused no profound sympathy. Two
<b>(p.169)</b> hours later signs of genuine mourning were no longer to be seen.
The throngs laughed and chattered and as the evening advanced
music was resumed at public resorts. There were many on chat
day in Austria who secretly sighed with relief that this heir of the
aged Emperor had been removed in favour of the much more
beloved young Archduke Charles.<br>
<br>
Of course the newspapers printed lengthy eulogies on the following
day, giving fitting expression to their indignation over the
assassination. But there was no indication that the event was to
be used politically against Serbia. The immediate concern of the
Imperial house was quite another one, namely the solemn obsequies.
According to his rank as heir-apparent, and especially since he had
died in the service of the monarchy, his burial place would obviously
have been the Capuchin vault, the historic place of interment of
the Habsburgs. But Franz Ferdinand had married a Countess
Chotek in the face of a long and bitter struggle on the part of the
Imperial family. She was a high aristocrat, but according to the
secret, ancient family laws of the Habsburgs, she was not considered
of equal birth with her husband, and at all the great official functions
the archduchesses stubbornly clung to their precedence over the
wife of the heir-apparent, whose children were not entitled to the
succession. The court pride even followed them in death. What?
-a Countess Chotek to be buried in the Imperial vault of the
Habsburgs? Perish the thought! A mighty intrigue set in; the
archduchesses stormed the old Emperor. Whereas official mourning
was expected from the populace, within the palace there was a wild
cross-play of bitterness and rancour and, as usual, the dead were
in the wrong. The masters of ceremony invented the assertion
that it had been the express desire of the deceased to be buried in
Artstetten, a provincial hole; and with this pseudo-pious excuse,
they were able cautiously to evade the public lying-in-state, the
funeral cortège and all the disputed questions of precedence that
went with it. The coffins of the murdered royalty were quietly
taken to Artstetten and interred there. Vienna, whose perpetual
fondness for a show was thus deprived of a great opportunity, had
already begun to forget the tragic occurrence. After all the violent
death of Queen Elizabeth and of the Crown Prince, and the scandalous
flight of all sorts of members of the Imperial house, had long
since accustomed Vienna to the thought that the old Emperor
would outlive his Tantalidean house in imperturbable solitude.
Only a few weeks more and the name and the figure of Franz
Ferdinand would have disappeared for all time out of history.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.170)</b> In less than a week, however, attacks suddenly began to appear
in the newspapers, and their constantly mounting crescendo was
regulated too consistently for them to have been entirely accidental.
The Serbian government was accused of collusion in the assassination,
and there were veiled hints that Austria would not permit the
murder of its supposedly beloved heir-apparent to go unavenged.
One could not escape the impression that some sort of action was
being prepared in the newspapers, but no one thought of war.
Neither banks nor business houses nor pnvate persons changed their
plans. Why should we be concerned with these constant skirmishes
with Serbia which, as all knew, arose out of some commercial
treaties concerned with the export of Hungarian pigs? My bags
were packed so that I could go to Verhaeren in Belgium, my work
was in full swing, what did the dead Archduke in his catafalque
have to do with my life? The summer was beautiful as never
before and promised to become even more beautiful-and we all
looked out upon the world without a care. I can recall that on my
last day in Baden I was walking through the vineyards with a
friend, when an old wine-grower said to us: “We haven’t had
such a summer for a long time. If it stays this way, we'll get better
grapes than ever. Folks will remember this summer!”<br>
<br>
He did not know, the old man in his blue cooper’s smock, how
gruesomely true a word he had spoken.<br>
<br>
<center>*   *   *</center><br>
<br>
In Le Coq, the small seaside resort near Ostend where I had
planned to stay for two weeks before paying my annual visit to
Verhaeren’s country home, the same unconstraint reigned as elsewhere.
The happy holiday-makers lay under their coloured tents
on the beach or went in bathing, children were flying kites, and
the young people were dancing in front of the cafés on the <i>digue</i>.
All nationalities were peaceably assembled together, and one heard
a good deal of German in particular, for tourists from the nearby
Rhineland had long shown a preference for the Belgian seacoast.
The only disturbance came from the newsboy who, to stimulate
business, shouted the threatening captions in the Parisian papers:
<i>L'Autriche provoque la Russie</i>, <i>L'Allemagne prépare la mobilisation</i>.
We could see the faces of those who bought copies grow gloomy,
but only for a few minutes. After all, we had been familiar with
these diplomatic conflicts for years; they were always happily
settled at the last minute, before things grew too serious. Why not
this time as well? Half an hour later, one saw the same people <b>(p.171)</b>
splashing about in the water, the kites soared aloft, the gulls fluttered
about and the sun laughed warm and clear over the peaceful land.<br>
<br>
But the bad news piled up and constantly became more threatening.
First it was Austria’s ultimatum to Serbia, and the evasive
reply to it, then an exchange of telegrams between the monarchs,
and finally the barely hidden mobilization. The village became
irksome to me; every day I would take the little electric train for
Ostend to be closer to the news, and it grew increasingly worse.
People were still bathing, the hotels still full, the <i>digue</i> still crowded
with scrolling, laughing, chatting summer visitors. But for the
first time now, however, a new element appeared; one saw Belgian
soldiers who had never before been seen on the beach, and machine-guns.
in small carts drawn by dogs, this being a peculiarity of the
Belgian army.<br>
<br>
I was sitting in a café with some Belgian friends, a young painter
and the poet Crommelynck. We had spent the afternoon at the
house of James Ensor, Belgium’s greatest painter, a very reticent
and retiring sore of man, who was much prouder of the poor and
petty waltzes and polkas that he composed for the military band
than he was of his fantastic paintings in glowing colours. He had
shown us his work, indeed rather unwillingly, for the thought that
somebody might possibly purchase one of them dejected him in
a buffoonist sort of way. His ideal, so his friends laughingly told
me, was to sell them at a high price and then be permitted to keep
them, for he was as avaricious about money as he was about his
work. Whenever he was forced to part with a painting, he was
plunged into despair for several days. With all his curious crotchets
this genial Harpagon had made us quite jolly; and when a troop
of soldiers happened to pass by with its machine-gun harnessed to
a dog, one of us got up to stroke the dog. This disgusted the officer
in charge, who feared that this petting of an adjunct of war might
possibly damage the dignity of a military institution. “Why all
this stupid marching about?” one of our group muttered. But
another immediately replied with excitement: “One has to be
prepared. They say that in case of war the Germans intend to
invade us.“ “Out of the question!” I said with honest conviction
for in that old world one still believed in the sanctity of treaties.
“If something were to happen and France and Germany were to
destroy each other to the last man, you Belgians would still keep
your feet dry!” But our pessimist did not give in. There must
be sufficient reason, he continued, if such measures had been ordered
in Belgium. Years ago they had already got wind of a secret plan <b>(p.172)</b>
of the German General Staff, whereby, in case of an attack on
France, Belgian was to be invaded despite all ratified treaties.
But neither would I give in. It appeared completely ridiculous to
me that while thousands and tens of thousands of Germans were
enjoying at their leisure the hospitality of this small, impartial
country, an army should stand in readiness at the frontier prepared
to march in. “Nonsense!” I said. “You can hang me to this
lamp-post if the Germans march into Belgium!” Today I am still
grateful to my friends that they did not take me at my word when
the time came.<br>
<br>
Then came the critical last days of July and each hour brought
conflicting news-the Kaiser’s telegrams to the Tsar, the Tsar’s
telegram to the Kaiser, Austria’s declaration of war on Serbia, the
murder of James. One sensed the serious situation. At once an
icy wind of fear blew over the beach and swept it bare. People
left the hotels by the thousands and stormed the trains, and even
the most optimistic began to pack their bags with speed. I too
booked a ticket the moment that I learned of Austria’s declaration
of war on Serbia, and it was high time. The Orient Express was
the last train from Belgium to Germany. We stood in the corridors,
excited and impatient, everybody talking to everybody else. No
one could remain quiet or read, and at each station we would rush
out of the train to get the latest news, filled with the secret hope
that some determined hand would restrain the Fates that had been
unleashed. We still did not believe there would be war and even
less in the possibility of an invasion of Belgium. We could not
believe it because we did not wish to believe in such madness. We
had passed through Verviers, the Belgium border station, and gradually
the train approached the frontier. German ticket collectors
and guards got on, and in ten minutes we would be on German soil.
Half-way to Herbesthal, the first German station, the train
suddenly stood still in the middle of an open field. We hurried
into the corridor to the windows. What had happened? In the
darkness I saw one goods train after another coming towards us,
open cars covered with tarpaulins, under which I thought I could
indistinctly see the threatening outlines of cannon. My heart missed
a beat. It could be nothing but the advance of the Germany army.
But perhaps, I comforted myself, it was only a precautionary
measure, merely a threat of mobilization, and not mobilization
itself. Always in time of danger, the renewed will to hope becomes
enormous. Finally we heard the signal “All clear!” and the train
rolled on into the station at Herbesthal. I leapt down the steps<b>(p.173)</b>
with one jump to get a newspaper and to learn what was going
on. But the military had occupied the station. When I wished
to enter the waiting-room, an official, white-bearded and grave,
stood in front of the locked door: no one was permitted to enter
the station buildings. But I had already heard the rattling and
clanking of swords behind the carefully covered glass panes and the
hard thud of grounded rifles. No longer any doubt, the monstrous
thing, the German invasion of Belgium contrary to every provision
of international law, was in progress. Shuddering, I went back to
the train and rode on, back to Austria. Now there was no more
doubt: I was riding into the war.<br>
<br>
<center>*  *  *</center><br>
<br>
The next morning I was in Austria. In every station placards
had been put up announcing general mobilization. The trains were
filled with fresh recruits, banners were flying, music sounded, and
in Vienna I found the entire city in a tumult. The first shock at the
news of war-the war that no one, people or government, had
wanted-the war which had slipped, much against their will, out
of the clumsy hands of the diplomats who had been bluffing and
toying with it, had suddenly been transformed into enthusiasm.
There were parades in the street, flags, ribbons, and music burst
forth everywhere, young recruits were marching triumphantly,
their faces lighting up at the cheering-they, the John Does and
Richard Roes who usually go unnoticed and uncelebrated.<br>
<br>
And to be truthful, I must acknowledge that there was a majestic,
rapturous, and even seductive something in this first outbreak of
the people from which one could escape only with difficulty. And
in spite of all my hatred and aversion for war, I should not like to
have missed the memory of those first days. As never before,
thousands and hundreds of thousands felt what they should have
felt in peace time, that they belonged together. A city of two
million, a country of nearly fifty million, in that hour felt that they
were participating in world history, in a moment which would
never recur, and that each one was called upon to cast his infinitesimal
self into the glowing mass, there to be purified of all
selfishness. All differences of class, rank, and language were
swamped at that moment by the rushing feeling of fraternity.
Strangers spoke to one another in the streets, people who had
avoided each other for years shook hands, everywhere one saw
excited faces. Each individual experienced an exaltation of his
ego, he was no longer the isolated person of former times, he had <b>(p.174)</b>
his people to war unless from direct necessity, would have demanded
such a sacrifice of blood unless evil, sinister, and criminal foes were
threatening the peace of the Empire. The Germans, on the other
hand, had read the telegrams of their Kaiser to the Tsar, in which
he struggled for peace. A mighty respect for the “authorities,” the
ministers, the diplomats, and for their discernment and honesty still
animated the simple man. If war had come, then it could only
have come against the wishes of their own statesmen; they themselves
were not at fault, indeed no one in the entire land was at
fault. Therefore the criminals, the war-mongers must be the other
fellows; we had taken up arms in self-defence against a villainous and
crafty enemy, who had “attacked” peaceful Austria and Germany
without the slightest provocation. In 1939, however, this almost
religious faith in the honesty or at least in the capacity of one’s own
government had disappeared throughout Europe. Diplomacy was
despised, since one had seen with bitterness how the possibility of a
lasting peace had been betrayed at Versailles; nations remembered
all too clearly how they had been shamefully cheated of the promises
of disarmament and the abolition of secret diplomacy. In truth,
there was not a single statesman in 1939 for whom anyone had
respect, and none in whom one would confidently entrust his
destiny. The humblest French crossing-sweeper ridiculed Daladier,
and in England, since Munich-“peace in our time”-all confidence
in Chamberlain’s perspicacity had vanished; in Italy and in Germany
the masses looked upon Mussolini and Hitler with anxiety:
Where will he drive us now? To be sure, they had no choice, the
Fatherland was at stake: and so the soldiers shouldered their guns,
the women let their children go, but not with the unswerving
belief of other times that this sacrifice had been unavoidable. They
obeyed but without rejoicing. They went to the front, but without
the old dream of being a hero; the people, and each individual,
already knew that they were naught but the victims of mundane,
political stupidity or of an incomprehensible and malicious force
of destiny.<br>
<br>
Besides, what did the great mass know of war in 1914, after
nearly half a century of peace? They did not know war, they
had hardly given it a thought. It had become legendary, and
distance had made it seem romantic and heroic. They still saw it in
the perspective of their school readers and of paintings in museums;
brilliant cavalry attacks in glittering uniforms, the fatal shot always
straight through the heart, the entire campaign a resounding march
of victory-“We'll be home at Christmas,” the recruits shouted <b>(p.175)</b>
laughingly to their mothers in August, 1914. Who in the villages
and the cities of Austria remembered “real” war? A few ancients
at best, who, in 1866, had fought against Prussia, which was now
their ally. But what a quick, bloodless, far-off war that had been,
a campaign that had ended in three weeks with few victims and
before it had well started! A rapid excursion into the romantic,
a wild, manly adventure-that is how the war of 1914 was painted
in the imagination of the simple man, and the young people were
honestly afraid that they might miss this most wonderful and exciting
experience of their lives; that is why they hurried and thronged
to the colours, and that is why they shouted and sang in the trains
that carried them to the slaughter; wildly and feverishly the red
wave of blood coursed through the veins of the entire nation.<br>
<br>
But the generation of 1939 knew war. It no longer deceived
itself. It knew that it was not romantic but barbaric. It knew that
it would last for years and years, an irretrievable span of time. It
knew that the men did not storm the enemy, decorated with oak
leaves and ribbons, but hung about for weeks at a time in trenches
or quarters covered with vermin and mad with thirst, and that men
were crushed and mutilated from afar without ever coming face to
face with the foe: The newspapers and cinemas had already made
the new and devilish techniques of destruction familiar : people
knew how the giant tanks ground the wounded under them in their
path, and how aeroplanes destroyed women and children in their
beds. They knew chat a World War of 1939, because of its soulless
mechanization, would be a thousand times more cruel, more bestial,
more inhuman than all of the former wars of mankind. Not a
single individual of the generation of 1939 believed any longer in
the God-decreed justice of war: and what was worse, they no longer
believed in the justice and permanence of the peace it was to achieve.
For they remembered all too well the disappointments that the last
war had brought; impoverishment instead of riches, bitterness instead
of contentment, famine, inflation, revolts, the loss of civil
rights, enslavement by the State, nerve-destroying uncertainty,
distrust of each against all.<br>
<br>
That is what made the difference. The war of 1939 had a spiritual
meaning, a question of freedom and the preservation of moral
possessions; and to fight for an idea makes man hard and determined.
The war of 1914, on the other hand, knew nothing of
realities, it still served a delusion, the dream of a better, a righteous
and peaceful world. And it is only delusion, and not knowledge,
that bestows happiness. That is why the victims, crowned with <b>(p.176)</b>
flowers and with oak leaves in their helmets, marched jubilating
on their way to the shambles through streets that rumbled and
sparkled as if on a holiday.<br>
<br>
That I myself did not succumb to this sudden rapture of patriotism
was not due to any unusual sobriety or discernment on my part,
but rather because of my former manner of life. Two days earlier
I had still been in “enemy” country and could convince myself
that the great masses in Belgium were just as peaceful and unaware
as our own people. What is more, I had lived too internationally
to be able suddenly, overnight, to hate a world that was as much
mine as my fatherland. I had long been dubious of politics, and
especially during recent years I had discussed countless times with
my French and Italian friends the stupidity of a possible war. I
was inoculated to some extent against the infection of patriotic
enthusiasm and, being thus prepared against this fever of the first
hours, I remained fully determined not to allow this war of brothers,
brought about by clumsy diplomats and brutal munitions-manufacturers,
to affect my conviction of the necessity of European unity.
As a result, I was inwardly secure from the very beginning of
my world citizenship; it was more difficult to determine my course
as a citizen of the State. Although only thirty-two, I had no military
obligations for the time being, for at all physical examinations I
had been declared unfit, which even on those past occasions had
made me heartily glad. These rejections saved me from wasting
a year in stupid army service, and furthermore, it struck me as a
criminal anachronism to let myself be trained in the use of implements
of murder in the twentieth century. The right thing for a
man of my convictions would have been to declare myself a conscientious
objector, a course which, in Austria, invited the heaviest
punishments imaginable and would have demanded a martyr’s
steadfastness of soul. It happens-and I am not ashamed to admit
this fault-that there is nothing heroic in my nature. My natural
attitude to all dangerous situations has always been to evade, and
it was not only on this occasion that I had to accept, perhaps justly,
the reproach of indecision that so often was made to my revered
master of an earlier century, Erasmus of Rotterdam. On the other
hand, it was equally unbearable to me as a comparatively young
man, to wait until they dug me out of my retirement and planted
me in some inept spot. So I looked around for some activity in
which I could serve to advantage without being militarily active,
and the fact that one of my friends, an officer of rank, was in the
War Archives, procured my appointment there. I worked in the <b>(p.178)</b>
library, where my knowledge of laguages was useful, and styled and
improved publicity releases-certainly not a glorious occupanon, I
readily concede, but at least one that seemed to suit me better than
pushing a bayonet into the entrails of a Russian peasant. But the
deciding factor was that I had sufficient time after these none-too-arduous
duties to devote to what I believed was the most important
service in the war: the preparation for the understanding to come.<br>
<br>
<center>*  *  *</center><br>
<br>
My position among my Viennese friends was much more difficult
than my official one. Limited in their experience of Europe as a
whole, and living entirely within the German circle of thought,
most of our writers believed that their best contribution was to
strengthen the enthusiasm of the masses and support the supposed
beauty of war with poetic appeals or scientific ideologies. Nearly
all the German authors, led by Hauptmann and Dehmel, felt themselves
obliged, like the bards of the ancient Germani, by songs and
runes to inflame the advancing warriors with enthusiasm for death.
Poems poured forth that rhymed <i>Krieg</i> with <i>Sieg</i> and <i>Not</i> with <i>Tod</i>.
Solemnly the poets swore never again to have any cultural association
with a Frenchman or an Englishman; they went even further,
they denied overnight that there had ever been any French or English
culture. It was all insignificant and valueless in comparison with
German character, German art, and German thought. But the
savants were even worse. The sole wisdom of the philosophers
was to declare the war a “bath of steel” which would beneficially
preserve the strength of the people from enervation. The physicians
fell into line and praised their prosthesis so extravagantly that one
was almost tempted to have a leg amputated so that the healthy
member might be replaced by an artificial one. The ministers of
all creeds had no desire to be outdone and joined in the chorus, at
times as if a horde of possessed were raving, and yet all of these
men were the very same whose reason, creative power, and humane
conduct one had admired only a week, a month, before.<br>
<br>
The most shocking thing about this madness was that most of
these persons were honest. For the most part, too old or physically
unfit for military service, they thought themselves in decency
obliged to take part in every supporting effort. All that they had
achieved they owed to the language and thus to the people. And
so they desired to serve their people by means of the language and
let them hear what they wished to hear: that justice was solely on
their side in this struggle, and injustice on the other, that Germany <b>(p.179)</b>
would triumph and the enemy be ignominiously conquered-quite
oblivious of the fact that in so doing they were betraying the true
mission of the poet, the preserver and defender of the universal
humanity of mankind. Of course many felt the bitter taste of
disgust on their tongues at their own words as soon as the fumes
of the initial enthusiasm had evaporated. But in the early months
those who raved the loudest attracted most attention, and so they
sang and yelled in a wild chorus here, there and everywhere.<br>
<br>
To my mind, the most typical and most moving case of such
honest and at once inane ecstasy, was that of Ernst Lissauer. I
knew him well. He wrote short, incisive, brittle poems, and was
the most kindly person imaginable. Even today I can recall how
I had to bite my lips to hide my smile on the occasion of his first
visit. Arbitrarily, judging by his pithy Germanic verses which
strove for the utmost brevity, I had pictured him as a slim, raw-boned
young man. Instead, there toddled into my room a round
little man, a jolly face above a double double-chin, bubbling over
with self-importance and exuberance, stuttering in his haste, and so
possessed with poetry that nothing could keep him from citing and
reciting his verses again and again. But for all the laughable things
he did, I had to like him because he was warm-hearted, comradely,
honest and demoniacally attached to his art.<br>
<br>
He was of a wealthy German family, had been educated in the
Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Berlin, and possibly he was the
most Prussian, or Prussian-assimilated Jew I had ever known. He
spoke no other living tongue and had never been outside of Germany.
Germany was his world and the more Germanic anything
was, the more it delighted him. York, Luther, and Stein were his
heroes, the German War of Liberation his favourite topic, and Bach
his musical god; he played him beautifully in spite of small,
short, thick, spongy fingers. No one was more familiar with
German poetry, and no one was more enamoured of, more enchanted
with the German language; like so many Jews whose
families had entered German culture late, he had more faith in
Germany than the most devoted of Germans.<br>
<br>
When the war broke out, his first act was to hurry to the barracks
to enlist. I can well imagine the laughter of the sergeants and
corporals when this fat body came puffing up the stairs. He was
promptly rejected. Lissauer was in despair but, like the others, he
at least wished to serve Germany with his muse. Everything that
the newspapers and the German army communiqués published was
gospel truth to him. His country had been attacked, and the worst <b>(p.180)</b>
criminal-as cast by Wilhehnstrasse-was that perfidious Sir Edward
Grey, the British Foreign Minister. This feeling, that England was
the arch-enemy of Germany and responsible for the war, found expression in
his “Hymn of Hate,” a poem-I do not have a copy before
me-that in hard, short, impressive stanzas raised the hatred against
England to an eternal oath never to forgive her for her “crime.”
It was soon fatefully apparent how easy it is to work up hatred (this
blinded, fat little Jew, Lissauer, anticipated Hitler’s example). The
poem exploded like a bomb in a munitions depot. Possibly no
other poem in Germany, not even the “Watch on the Rhine,” got
round as quickly as this notorious “Hymn of Hate.” The Kaiser
was enraptured and bestowed the Order of the Red Eagle upon
Lissauer, the poem was reprinted in all the newspapers, teachers
read it out loud to the children in school, officers at the front read
it to their soldiers, until everyone knew the litany of hate by heart.
As if that were not enough, the little poem was set to music and,
arranged for chorus, was sung in the theatres; among Germany’s
seventy millions there was hardly one person who did not know
the “Hymn of Hate” from the first line to the last, and soon it
was known-with less rapture, be it said-to the entire world.
Overnight Ernst Lissauer had achieved the greatest renown won
by any poet in that war-but, to be sure, a renown that later was
to burn him like the shirt of Nessus. For no sooner had the war
ended, with merchants seeking to resume trade and politicians
making honest efforts towards mutual understanding, than everything
was done to disclaim the poem which had demanded eternal
enmity with England. And to shake off one's own culpability,
poor “Hate-Lissauer” was pilloried as the sole culprit of this insane
hysteria of hate, which in fact everyone from the highest to the
lowest had shared in 1914. All who had celebrated him in 1914
turned from him pointedly in 1919. The newspapers ceased to
print his poems, and when he appeared among his fellows a marked
silence fell. Finally he was driven out by Hitler from the Germany
to which he had been attached with every fibre of his heart, to die
forgotten, the tragic victim of the one poem which had raised him
so highly only to dash him to the lowest depths.<br>
<br>
<center>*  *  *</center><br>
<br>
The rest were just like Lissauer. Their emotions were honest
and they thought they were acting honestly, the professors and
poets, the sudden patriots of that time. I do not deny it. But it
took little time for it to become apparent how terrible a disaster <b>(p.181)</b>
had been caused by these songs in praise of war and orgies of hatred.
In 1914 all the warring nations were already in a state of overexcitation
and the worst rumour was immediately transformed into
truth, the most absurd slander believed. In Germany men by the
dozen swore that they had seen wim their own eyes automobiles
laden with gold going from France to Russia shortly before the
outbreak of the war; the tales of gouged-out eyes and severed
hands which appear on the third or fourth day of every war filled
the newspapers. They did not know, those innocents who spread
such lies, that the accusation of every possible cruelty against the
enemy is as much war matériel as are munitions and planes, and
that they are systemancally taken out of storage at the beginning
of every war. War does not perm1t itself to be co-ordinated with
reason and righteousness. It needs stimulated emotions, enthusiasm
for its own cause and hatred for the adversary.<br>
<br>
It lies in human nature that deep emotion cannot be prolonged
indefinitely, either in the individual or in a people, a fact that is
known to all military organizations. Therefore it requires an
artificial stimulation, a constant doping of excitement; and this
whipping-up was to be peformed by the intellectuals, the poets,
the writers, and the journalists, scrupulously or otherwise, honestly
or as a matter of professional routine. They were to beat the drums
of hatred and beat them they did, until the ears of the unprejudiced
hummed and their hearts quaked. In Germany, in France, in Italy,
in Russia, and in Belgium, they all obediently served the war
propaganda and thus mass delusion and mass hatred, instead of
fighting against it.<br>
<br>
The results were disastrous. At that time, propaganda not yet
having worn itself thin in peace time, the nations believed everything
that they saw in print in spite of thousands of disillusionments.
And so the pure, beautiful, sacrificial enthusiasm of the opening
days became gradually transformed into an orgy of the worst and
most stupid impulses. In Vienna and Berlin one “fought” France
and England in the Ringstrasse and the Friedrichstrasse, which was
definitely more comfortable. The French and English signs on the
shops were made to disappear and even a convent Zu den Englischen
Fräulein had to change its name because the people were aroused,
not knowing that <i>englische</i> referred to the angels and not the Anglo-Saxons.
Sober merchants stamped or pasted <i>Gott strafe England</i> on
their letters, and society ladies swore (so they wrote to the newspapers)
that never again would they speak a single word of French.
Shakespeare was banned from the German stage, Mozart and Wagner <b>(p.182)</b>
from the French and English concert halls, German professors declared
that Dante had been Germanic, the French that Beethoven
had been a Belgian, intellectual culture was requisitioned without
scruple from the enemy countries like grain and ore. It was not
enough that thousands of peace-loving citizens were killing each
other daily at the front. In the hinterland there was mutual berating
and slandering of the great dead of the enemy countries,
who had been slumbering in their graves for centuries. The mental
confusion increased in absurdity. The cook at her stove, who had
never been outside the city and had never looked at an atlas since
her schooldays, believed that Austria could not endure without
Sanchschak (a small frontier hamlet somewhere in Bosnia). Cabdrivers
argued on the streets about the reparations to be imposed
on France, fifty billions or a hundred, without knowing how much
a billion was. There was no city, no group that had not fallen
prey to this dreadful hysteria of hatred. The ministers preached
from their pulpits, the Social Democrats, who but a month before
had branded militarism as the greatest crime, clamoured perhaps
louder than all the others so as not to be classed as “people without
a fatherland,” in the words of the Kaiser. It was the war of an unsuspicious
generation, and the greatest peril was the inexhaustible
faith of the nations in the single-sided justice of their cause.<br>
<br>
<center>*  *  *</center><br>
<br>
It soon became impossible to converse reasonably with anybody
in the first war weeks of 1914. The most peaceable and the most
good-natured were intoxicated with the smell of blood. Friends
whom I had looked upon as decided individualists and even as
philosophical anarchists, changed over night into fanatic patriots
and from patriots into insatiable annexionists. Every conversation
ended in some stupid phrase such as: “He who cannot hate cannot
really love,” or in coarse inculpations. Comrades with whom I
had not quarrelled for years accused me rudely of no longer being
an Austrian; why did I not go over to France or Belgium? They
even hinted cautiously that such a sentiment as that the war was a
crime ought to be brought to the attention of the authorities, for
“defeatists”-that nice word had just been invented in France were
the worst betrayers of the fatherland.<br>
<br>
Nothing remained but to withdraw into one’s self and to keep
silent while the others ranted and raved. It was not easy. For even
in exile-I have experienced it to the full-it is not as difficult to
live alone as it is in one’s own country. In Vienna I had estranged <b>(p.183)</b>
my old friends and this was no time to seek new ones. It was
only with Rainer Maria Rilke that I sometimes had talks of intimate
understanding. It had become possible to secure him, too, for our
War Archives, for with his over-delicate nerves he would have
been the most impossible soldiers, since filth, smells, and noise actually
produced physical nausea in him. I always have to smile when I
remember him in uniform. One day there was a knock at my door.
A timid soldier stood outside. For the moment I was frightened:
Rilke-Ranier Maria Rilke, in military disguise! He looked so
touchingly awkward, his collar too tight, disturbed by the thought
that he had to salute every officer, clicking his heels together. And
since, in his high impulse to perfection, he wished to perform even
this insignificant formality of the ritual in as exemplary a manner
as possible, he found himself in a perpetual state of confusion. “I
have always hated this military uniform,” he said to me in his soft
tone of voice, “since my time in the military academy. I thought
that I had escaped it once and for all. And now again, at almost
forty!” Fortunately there were helping hands to protect him and,
thanks to a benevolent medical examination, he was soon discharged.
Once more he came into my room, this time to take leave-back
in civilian clothes again-it seemed almost as if he had been wafted
in, so noiseless were his movements. He wished to thank me for
endeavouring, through Rolland, to rescue his library which had
been located in Paris. For the first time he no longer looked
young; It was as if the thought of all this horror had exhausted
him. “Abroad,” he said, “if one could only go abroad! War is
always prison.” Then he left. Again I was all alone.<br>
<br>
After a few weeks, determined to escape this dangerous mass
psychosis, I moved to a rural suburb to commence my personal
warm the midst of war, the struggle against the betrayal of Reason
by the current mass passion.<br>

<br>
<b>(p.3)</b><br>
<br>
Here's how it started. I'd never said a word. Not one word.
It was Arthur Ganate* that made me speak up. Arthur was a
friend from med school. So we meet on the Place Clichy. It
was after breakfast. He wants to talk to me. I listen. “Not out
here,” he says. “Let's go in.” We go in. And there we were.
“This terrace,” he says, “is for jerks. Come on over there.”
Then we see that there's not a soul in the street, because of the
heat; no cars, nothing. Same when it's very cold, not a soul in
the street; I remember now, it was him who had said one time:
“The people in Paris always look busy, when all they actually
do is roam around from morning to night; it's obvious, because
when the weather isn't right for walking around, when it's too
cold or too hot, you don't see them anymore; they're all indoors,
drinking their cafes cremes or their beers. And that's the
truth. The century of speed! they call it. Where? Great changes!
they say. For instance? Nothing has changed. They go on admiring
themselves, that's all. And that's not new either. Words.
Even the words haven't changed much. Two or three little ones,
here and there ... ” Pleased at having proclaimed these useful
truths, we sat looking at the ladies in the cafe.<br>
<br>
After a while the conversation turned to President Poincaré,*
who was due to inaugurate a puppy show that same morning,
and that led to <i>Le Temps</i>,* where I'd read about it. Arthur
Banate starts kidding me about <i>Le Temps</i>. “What a paper!” he
says. “When it comes to defending the French race, it hasn't
its equal.” And quick to show I’m well informed, I fire back:
“The French race can do with some defending, seeing it doesn't
exist.”<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, it does!” he says. “And a fine race it is! the finest
in the world, and anybody who says different is a yellow dog!”
And he starts slanging me. Naturally I stuck to my guns.<br>
<br>
“It's not true! What you call a race is nothing but a collection
of riffraff like me, bleary-eyed, flea-bitten, chilled to the bone. <b>(p.4)</b> 
They came from the four corners of the earth, driven by hunger,
plague, tumors, and the cold, and stopped here. They couldn’t
go any further because of the ocean. That’s France, that’s the
French people.”<br>
<br>
“Bardamu,” he says very gravely and a bit sadly. “Our forefathers
were as good as we are, don't speak ill of them! ... ”<br>
<br>
“You’re right, Arthur, there you’re right! Hateful and spineless,
raped and robbed, mangled and witless, they were as good
as we are, you can say that again! We never change. Neither
our socks nor our masters nor our opinions, or we’re so slow
about it that it’s no use. We were born loyal, and that’s what
killed us! Soldiers free of charge, heroes for everyone else, talking
monkeys, tortured words, we are the minions of King
Misery. He’s our lord and master! When we misbehave, he
tightens his grip . . . his fingers are around our neck, that
makes it hard to talk, got to be careful if we want to eat . . . 
For nothing at all he’ll choke you . . . It’s not a life . . .”<br>
<br>
“There's love, Bardamu!”<br>
<br>
“Arthur,” I tell him, “love is the infinite placed within the
reach of poodles. I have my dignity!”<br>
<br>
“You do, do you? You're an anarchist, that's what you are!”<br>
<br>
A wise guy, as you see, with only the most advanced
opinions.<br>
<br>
“That's right, you windbag, I'm an anarchist. And to prove it,
I've written a kind of prayer of social vengeance, it'll bowl you
over. <i>The Golden Wings</i>! That's the title!” And I recite:<br>
<br>
<i>“A God who counts minutes and pennies, a desperate sensual
God, who grunts like a pig. A pig with golden wings, who falls
and falls, always belly side up, ready for caresses, that's him,
our master. Come, kiss me.”</i><br>
<br>
“Your little piece doesn't hold water,” he says. “I'm for the
established order, and I'm not interested in politics. What's
more, the day my country asks me to shed my blood, it’ll find
me ready, and no slacker.” That's what he said.<br>
<br>
It so happened that the war was creeping up on us without
our knowing it, and something was wrong with my wits. That
short but animated discussion had tired me out. Besides, I was
upset because the waiter had sort of called me a piker on account
of the tip. Well, in the end Arthur and I made up. Completely.
We agreed about almost everything.<br>
<br>
“It’s true,” I said, trying to be conciliatory. “All in all, you're <b>(p.5)</b>
right. But the fact is we're all sitting in a big galley, pulling at
the oars with all our might. You can't tell me different! . . . 
Sitting on nails and pulling like mad. And what do we get for
it? Nothing! Thrashings and misery, hard words and hard
knocks. We're workers, they say. Work, they call it! That's the
crummiest part of the whole business. We're down in the hold,
heaving and panting, stinking and sweating our balls off, and
meanwhile! Up on deck in the fresh air, what do you see?! Our
masters having a fine time with beautiful pink and perfumed
women on their laps. They send for us, we're brought up on
deck. They put on their top hats and give us a big spiel like as
follows: “You no-good swine! We're at war! Those stinkers in
Country No. 2! We're going to board them and cut their livers
out! Let's go! Let's go! We've got everything we need on board!
All together now! Let's hear you shout so the deck trembles:
‘Long live Country No. 1!’ So you'll be heard for miles around.
The man that shouts the loudest will get a medal and a lollipop!
Let's go! And if there's anybody that doesn’t want to be killed
on the sea, he can go and get killed on land, it's even quicker!"<br>
<br>
“That's the way it is exactly,” said Arthur, suddenly willing
to listen to reason.<br>
<br>
But just then, who should come marching past the cafe where
we’re sitting but a regiment with the colonel up front on his
horse, looking nice and friendly, a fine figure of a man! Enthusiasm
lifted me to my feet.<br>
<br>
“I'll just go see if that's the way it is!” I sing out to Arthur,
and off I go to enlist, on the double.<br>
<br>
“Ferdinand!” he yells back. “Don't be an ass!” I suppose he
was nettled by the effect my heroism was having on the people
all around us.<br>
<br>
It kind of hurt my feelings the way he was taking it, but that
didn’t stop me. I fell right in. “Here I am,” I says to myself,
“and here I stay.”<br>
<br>
I just had time to call out to Arthur: “All right, you jerk,
we'll see”-before we turned the corner. And there I was with
the regiment, marching behind the colonel and his band. That's
exactly how it happened.<br>
<br>
We marched a long time. There were streets and more streets,
and they were all crowded with civilians and their wives, cheering
us on, bombarding us with flowers from café terraces, railroad
stations crowded churches. You never saw so many patriots
in all your life! And then there were fewer patriots . . . It <b>(p.6)</b>
started to rain, and then there were still fewer and fewer, and
not a single cheer, not one.<br>
<br>
Pretty soon there was nobody but us, we were all alone. Row
after row. The music had stopped. “Come to think of it,” I said
to myself, when I saw what was what, “this is no fun anymore!
I'd better try something else!” I was about to clear out. Too
late! They'd quietly shut the gate behind us civilians. We were
caught like rats.<br>

in <i>Documents of 20th Century Art: Futurist Manifestos</i> ed. Umbro 
Apollonio and trans. R.W. Flint (New York: Viking Press, 1973), 19-24.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.19)</b><br>
<br>
We had stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging mosque
lamps with domes of filigreed brass, domes starred like our spirits,
shining like them with the prisoned radiance of electric hearts. For
hours we had trampled our atavistic ennui into rich oriental rugs,
arguing up to the last confines of logic and blackening many reams of
paper with our frenzied scribbling.<br>
<br>
An immense pride was buoying us up, because we felt ourselves
alone at that hour, alone, awake, and on our feet, like proud beacons or
forward sentries against an army of hostile stars glaring down at us
from their celestial encampments. Alone with stokers feeding the hellish
fires of great ships, alone with the black spectres who grope in the red-hot
bellies of locomotives launched down their crazy courses, alone
with drunkards reeling like wounded birds along the city walls.<br>
<br>
Suddenly we jumped, hearing the mighty noise of the huge double-decker
trams that rumbled by outside, ablaze with coloured lights,
like villages on holiday suddenly struck and uprooted by the flooding
Po and dragged over falls and through gorges to the sea.<br>
<br>
Then the silence deepened. But, as we listened to the old canal muttering
its feeble prayers and the creaking bones of sickly palaces above <b>(p.20)</b>
their damp green beards, under the windows we suddenly heard the
famished roar of automobiles.<br>
<br>
‘Let’s go!’ I said. ‘Friends, away! Let’s go! Mythology and the Mystic
Ideal are defeated at last. We’re about to see the Centaur’s birth and,
soon after, the first flight of Angels! . . . We must shake the gates of
life, test the bolts and hinges. Let’s go! Look there, on the earth, the
very first dawn! There’s nothing to match the splendour of the sun’s
red sword, slashing for the first time through our millennia! gloom!’<br>
<br>
We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on
their torrid breasts. I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier,
but revived at once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that
threatened my stomach.<br>
<br>
The raging broom of madness swept us out of ourselves and drove us
through streets as rough and deep as the beds of torrents. Here and
there, sick lamplight through window glass taught us to distrust the
deceitful mathematics of our perishing eyes.<br>
<br>
I cried, ‘The scent, the scent alone is enough for our beasts.’<br>
<br>
And like young lions we ran after Death, its dark pelt blotched with
pale crosses as it escaped down the vast violet living and throbbing
sky.<br>
<br>
But we had no ideal Mistress raising her divine form to the clouds,
nor any cruel Queen to whom to offer our bodies, twisted like Byzantine
rings! There was nothing to make us wish for death, unless the
wish to be free at last from the weight of our courage!<br>
<br>
And on we raced, hurling watchdogs against doorsteps, curling them
under our burning lyres like collars under a flatiron. Death, domesticated, 
met me at every turn, gracefully holding out a paw, or once in a
while hunkering down, making velvety caressing eyes at me from every
puddle.<br>
<br>
‘Let’s break out of the horrible shell of wisdom and throw ourselves
like pride-ripened fruit into the wide, contorted mouth of the wind!
Let’s give ourselves utterly to the Unknown, not in desperation but
only to replenish the deep wells of the Absurd!’<br>
<br>
The words were scarcely out of my mouth when I spun my car
around with the frenzy of a dog trying to bite its tail, and there, suddenly;
were two cyclists coming towards me, shaking their fists, wobbling like
two equally convincing but nevertheless contradictory arguments. Their
stupid dilemma was blocking my way - Damn! Ouch! . . . I stopped
short and to my disgust rolled over into a ditch with my wheels in the
air....<br>
<br>
<b>(p.21)</b><br>
<br>
O maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain!
I gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed
black breast of my Sudanese nurse. . . . When I came up - torn,
filthy, and stinking - from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot
iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart!<br>
<br>
A crowd of fishermen with handlines and gouty naturalists were
already swarming around the prodigy. With patient, loving care those
people rigged a tall derrick and iron grapnels to fish out my car, like a
big beached shark. Up it came from the ditch, slowly, leaving in the
bottom, like scales, its heavy framework of good sense and its soft
upholstery of comfort.<br>
<br>
They thought it was dead, my beautiful shark, but a caress from me
was enough to revive it; and there it was, alive again, running on its
powerful fins!<br>
<br>
And so, faces smeared with good factory muck - plastered with
metallic waste, with senseless sweat, with celestial soot - we, bruised,
our arms in slings, but unafraid, declared our high intentions to all the
living of the earth:<br>
<br>
MANIFESTO Of FUTURISM<br>
<br>
1. We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.<br>
<br>
2. Courage, audacity, and revolt will be essential elements of our poetry.<br>
<br>
3. Up to now literature has exalted a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and
sleep. We intend to exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the
racer’s stride, the mortal leap, the punch and the slap.<br>
<br>
4. We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been enriched by a new
beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with
great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath - a roaring car that
seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of
Samothrace.<br>
<br>
5. We want to hymn the man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his
spirit across the Earth, along the circle of its orbit.<br>
<br>
6. The poet must spend himself with ardour, splendour, and generosity,
to swell the enthusiastic fervour of the primordial elements.<br>
<br>
7. Except in struggle, there is no more beauty. No work without an
aggressive character can be a masterpiece. Poetry must be conceived
as a violent attack on unknown forces, to reduce and prostrate them
before man.<br>
<br>
8. We stand on the last promontory of the centuries! ... Why should we
look back, when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors <b>(p.22)</b>
of the Impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, 
because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed.<br>
<br>
9.We will glorify war—the world’s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive 
gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.<br>
<br>
10. We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind, will fight 
moralism, feminism, every opportunistic or utilitarian cowardice.<br>
<br>
11. We will sing of great crowds excited by work, by pleasure, and by riot; we will 
sing of the multicolored, polyphonic tides of revolution in the modern capitals; we 
will sing of the vibrant nightly fervor of arsenals and shipyards blazing with violent 
electric moons; greedy railway stations that devour smoke-plumed serpents; factories hung 
on clouds by the crooked lines of their smoke; bridges that stride the rivers like giant 
gymnasts, flashing in the sun with a glitter of knives; adventurous steamers that sniff 
the horizon; deep-chested locomotives whose wheels paw the tracks like the hooves of 
enormous steel horses bridled by tubing; and the sleek flight of planes whose propellers 
chatter in the wind like banners and seem to cheer like an enthusiastic crowd.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is from Italy that we launch through the world this violently upsetting incendiary 
manifesto of ours. With it, today, we establish <i>Futurism</i>, because we want to free 
this land from its smelly gangrene of professors, archaeologists, <i>ciceroni</i> and antiquarians. 
For too long has Italy been a dealer in second-hand clothes. We mean to free her from the 
numberless museums that cover her like so many graveyards.<br>
<br>
Museums: cemeteries!… Identical, surely, in the sinister promiscuity of so many bodies unknown 
to one another. Museums: public dormitories where one lies forever beside hated or unknown 
beings. Museums: absurd abattoirs of painters and sculptors ferociously slaughtering each other 
with color-blows and line-blows, the length of the fought-over walls!<br>
<br>
That one should make an annual pilgrimage, just as one goes to the graveyard on All Souls’ Day—that 
I grant. That once a year one should leave a floral tribute beneath the <i>Gioconda</i>, I grant you 
that. . . . But I don’t admit that our sorrows, our fragile courage, our morbid restlessness should be 
given a daily conducted tour through the museums. Why poison ourselves? Why rot?<br>
<br>
And what is there to see in an old picture except the laborious contortions of an artist throwing 
himself against the barriers that thwart his desire to express his dream completely? . . . Admiring an <b>(p.23)</b>
old picture is the same as pouring our sensibility into a funerary urn instead of hurtling it far off, 
in violent spasms of action and creation.<br>
<br>
Do you, then, wish to waste all your best powers in this eternal and 
futile worship of the past, from which you emerge fatally exhausted, 
shrunken, beaten down?<br>
<br>
In truth I tell you that daily visits to museums, libraries, and academies 
(cemeteries of empty exertion, Calvaries of crucified dreams, 
registries of aborted beginnings!) are, for artists, as damaging as the 
prolonged supervision by parents of certain young people drunk with 
their talent and their ambitious wills. When the future is barred to them, 
the admirable past may be a solace for the ills of the moribund, the 
sickly, the prisoner. . . . But we want no part of it, the past, we the 
young and strong <i>Futurists</i>!<br>
<br>
So let them come, the gay incendiaries with charred fingers! Here they 
are! Here they are!… Come on! Set fire to the library shelves! Turn 
aside the canals to flood the museums! . . . Oh, the joy of seeing the 
glorious old canvases bobbing adrift on those waters, discolored and 
shredded! . . .  Take up your pickaxes, your axes and hammers and 
wreck, wreck the venerable cities, pitilessly!<br>
<br>
The oldest of us is thirty: so we have at least a decade for finishing our 
work. When we are forty, other younger and stronger men will probably 
throw us in the wastebasket like useless manuscripts—we want it to happen!<br>
<br>
They will come against us, our successors, will come from far away, 
from every quarter, dancing to the winged cadence of their first songs, 
flexing the hooked claws of predators, sniffing doglike at the academy 
doors the strong odor of our decaying minds, which will have already 
been promised to the literary catacombs.<br>
<br>
But we won’t be there. . . .  At last they’ll find us—one winter’s 
night—in open country, beneath a sad roof drummed by a monotonous 
rain. They’ll see us crouched beside our trembling aeroplanes in the 
act of warming our hands at the poor little blaze that our books of 
today will give out when they take fire from the flight of our images.<br>
<br>
They’ll storm around us, panting with scorn and anguish, and all of 
them, exasperated by our proud daring, will hurtle to kill us, driven 
by a hatred the more implacable the more their hearts will be drunk 
with love and admiration for us.<br>
<br>
Injustice, strong and sane, will break out radiantly in their eyes.<br>
<br>
Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.24)</b>The oldest of us is thirty: even so we have already scattered treasures, 
a thousand treasures of force, love, courage, astuteness, and raw will-power; 
have thrown them impatiently away, with fury, carelessly, 
unhesitatingly, breathless, and unresting. . . .  Look at us! We are still 
untired! Our hearts know no weariness because they are fed with fire, 
hatred, and speed! . . . Does that amaze you? It should, because you 
can never remember having lived! Erect on the summit of the world, 
once again we hurl our defiance at the stars!<br>
<br>
You have objections?—Enough! Enough! We know them. . . .  We’ve 
understood! . . . Our fine deceitful intelligence tells us that we are the 
revival and extension of our ancestors—Perhaps! . . .  If only it were so!
—But who cares? We don’t want to understand! . . .  Woe to anyone 
who says those infamous words to us again!<br>
<br>
Lift up your heads!<br>
<br>
Erect on the summit of the world, once again we hurl defiance to the stars!<br>

Henri de Massis & Alfred de Tarde, “The Young People of Today” (1912-1913) 
from Joyn Boyer and Jan Goldstein, eds., <i>Twentieth-Century Europe</i> (Chicago: Chicago
University Press, 1987), 16-17, 22-23, 26-27.<br>
<br>
[In 1912, the journalists Massis and Tarde carried out a survey of the
attitudes of elite Parisian university students, between the ages of 18-25.]
The sentiment which underlies all these youthful attitudes, which
unanimously accords with the deepest tendencies in their thought, is that of
patriotic faith. That they are possessed of this sentiment is unequivocal and
undeniable. Optimism, that state of mind which defines the attitude of these
young people, manifests itself from the outset in the confidence which they
place in the future of France: there they find their first motive for acting,
the one which determines and directs all their activity.<br>
<br>
The young men of today have read the word of their destiny in this
French soul, which dictates to them a clear and imperious duty. . . .
Consider something even more significant. Students of advanced
rhetoric in Paris, that is, the most cultivated elite among young people,
declare that they find in warfare an aesthetic ideal of energy and strength.
They believe that “France needs heroism in order to live.’ “Such is the
faith,” comments Monsieur Tourolle, “which consumes modern youth.”
How many times in the last two years have we heard this repeated:
“Better war than this eternal waiting!” There is no bitterness in this avowal,
but rather a secret hope. . . .<br>
<br>
War! The word has taken on a sudden glamour. It is a youthful word,
wholly new, adorned with that seduction which the eternal bellicose
instinct has revived in the hearts of men. These young men impute to it all
the beauty with which they are in love and of which they have been
deprived by ordinary life. Above all, war, in their eyes, is the occasion for
the most noble of human virtues, those which they exalt above all others:
energy, mastery, and sacrifice for a cause which transcends ourselves. With
William James, they believe that life “would become odious if it offered
neither risks nor rewards for the courageous man.”<br>
<br>
A professor of philosophy at the Lycée Henri IV confided to us: “I once
spoke about war to my pupils. I explained to them that there were unjust
wars, undertaken out of anger, and that it was necessary to justify the
bellicose sentiment. Well, the class obviously did not follow me; they
Read this passage from a letter written to us by a young student of
rhetoric, Alsatian in origin. “The existence that we lead does no satisfy us
completely because, even if we possess all the elements of a good life, we
cannot organize
them in a practical, immediate deed that would take us, body and soul, and
hurl us outside of ourselves. One event only will permit that deed—war,
and hence we desire it. It is in the life of the camps, it is around the fire that
we will experience the supreme expansion of those French powers that are
within us. Our intellect will no longer be troubled in the face of the
unknowable, since it will be able to concentrate itself entirely on a present
duty from which uncertainty and hesitation are excluded.”<br>
<br>
Above all, perhaps, how can one ignore the success that accounts of our
colonialists have had among the young intellectuals under consideration
here? The expeditions of Moll, Lenfant, and Baratier arouse their
enthusiasm; they search in their own unperilous existences for a moral
equivalent to these bold destinies; they attempt to transpose this intrepid
valor into their inner lives.<br>
<br>
Some go further: their studies completed, they satisfy their taste for
action in colonial adventures. It is not enough for them to learn history:
they are making it. A young student from the Normale, Monsieur Klipfell,
who received his teaching degree in literature in July of 1912, requested to
be assigned to active service in Morocco, as a member of the Expeditionary
Corps. We can cite many a similar example. One things of Jacques Violet,
a twenty-year-old officer, who died so gloriously at Ksar-Teuchan, in
Adrar: he was killed at the head of his men, at the moment of victory, in a
grove of palm trees; among his belongings, they found a pair of white
gloves and a copy of Servitute and Military Grandeur; it was thus that he
went into combat. . . .<br>
<br>
For such young men, fired by patriotic faith and the cult of military
virtues, only the occasion for heroism is lacking.<br>

<br>
“It’s come!* It’s posted at the district mayor’s office,” a passerby shouted
to me as he ran.<br>
<br>
I reached the Rue Drouot in one leap and shouldered through the mob
that already filled the courtyard to approach the fascinating white sheet
pasted to the door. I read the message at a glance, then reread it slowly,
word for word, to convince myself that it was true:<br>
<br>
THE FIRST DAY OF MOBILIZATION WILL BE SUNDAY, AUGUST 2<br>
<br>
Only three lines, written hastily by a hand that trembled. It was an
announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen.<br>
<br>
The people who had read it moved away, stunned, while others crowded
in, but this silent numbness did not last. Suddenly a heroic wind lifted their
heads. What? War, was it? Well, then, let’s go! Without any signal, the
“Marseillaise” poured from thousands of throats, sheaves of flags appeared
at windows, and howling processions rolled out on boulevards. Each
column brandished a placard: <br>
<br>
ALSACE VOLUNTEERS, JEWISH VOLUNTEERS, POLISH VOLUNTEERS. <br>
<br>
They hailed one another above
the bravos of the crowd, and this human torrent, swelling at every corner,
moved on to circle around the Place de la Concorde, before the statue of
Strasbourg banked with flowers, then flowed toward the Place de la
République, where mobs from Belleville and Faubourg St. Antoine yelled
themselves hoarse on the refrain from the great days, “Aux armes,
citoyens!” (To arms, citizens!) But this time it was better than a song.
To gather the news for my paper, I ran around the city in every
direction. At the Cours la Reine I saw the fabled cuirassiers [cavalry] in
their horsetail plumes march by, and at the Rue La Fayette foot soldiers in
battle garb with women throwing flowers and kisses to them. In a
marshaling yard I saw guns being loaded, their long, thin barrels twined
around with branches and laurel leaves, while troops in red breeches piled
gaily into delivery vans they were scrawling with challenges and
caricatures. Young and old, civilians and military men burned with the
same excitement. It was like a Brotherhood Day.<br>
<br>
Dead tired but still exhilarated, I got back to L’Homme libre and burst into
the office of Georges Clemenceau, our chief.<br>
<br>
“What is Paris saying?” he asked me.<br>
<br>
“It’s singing, sir!”<br>
<br>
“Then everything will be all right. . . . .”<br>
<br>
His old patriot’s heart was not wrong; no cloud marred that fabulous
day. . . .<br>
<br>
Less than twenty-four hours later, seeing their old dreams of peace
crumble [socialist workers] would stream out into the boulevards . . . [but]
they would break into the “Marseillaise,” not the “Internationale”; they
would cry, “To Berlin!,” not “Down with war!”<br>
<br>
What did they have to defend, these black-nailed patriots? Not even a
shack, an acre to till, indeed hardly a patch of ground reserved at the Pantin
Cemetery; yet they would depart, like their rivals of yesterday, a heroic
song on their lips and a flower in their guns. No more poor or rich,
proletarians or bourgeois, right-wingers or militant leftists; there were only
Frenchmen.<br>
<br>
Beginning the next day, thousands of men eager to fight would jostle one
another outside recruiting offices, waiting to join up. Men who could have
stayed home, with their wives and children or an imploring mama. But no.
The word “duty” had a meaning for them, and the word “country” had
regained its splendor.<br>
<br>
I close my eyes, and they appear to me, those volunteers on the great
day; then I see them again in the old kepi [military cap] or blue helmet,
shouting, “Here!” when somebody called for men for a raid, or hurling
themselves into an attack with fixed bayonets, and I wonder, and I question
their bloody [ghosts].<br>

<center><b>Filippo T. Marinetti, “The War as the Catharsis of Italian Society”</b></center><br>
<br>
Filippo Marinetti (1876-1944) was the leading theoretician, poet, and propandist of the Italian Futurist movement, which he launched with the famous manifesto poublished on 20 February 1909. His extyreme cult of Italy, the machine age, and war led him to become an eloquent advocate of interventionism, as well as an ardent collaborator with, then supporter of, early Fascism (see Text 16). Despite his contept for academies he was made member of the Royal Academy of Italy in 1929 and accepted honours from the Salò Republic. As well as illustrating the metapolitical, aestheticizing nature of much fascist ideology, Marinetti is the extreme embodiment of the modernist, anti-conservative thrust of Fascism.[2]<br>
<br>
Italian students!<br>
Since as illustrious past was crushing Italy and an infinitely more glorious future seethed in her breast, six years ago, under our all too voluptuous skies, Futurist energy was to be born, to organize itself, to be channelled, to find in us her motors, her vehicles of illumination and propagation. Italy, more than any other country, was in dire need of Futurism, because she was dying of pastism.[3] The patient invented its own remedy. j<i>We happen to be ist doctors</i>. The remedy is valid for any country.<br>
<br>
Our immediate programme was a relentless war against Italian pastism: archaeology, academicism, senilism, quietism, the obsession with sex, the tourist industry, etc. Our ultra-violent, anti-clerical, and anti-traditionalist nationalism is based on the inexhaustible vitality of Italian blood and the struggle against the ancestor-cult, which, far from cementing the race, makes it anaemic and putrid. But we were to move beyond this immediate programme, already (partly) realized in six years of ceaseless battles.[ . . . ]<br>
<br>
Italian students!<br>
Dynamic and aggressive, Futurism is now being fully realized in the great world war which it—alone—foresaw and glorified before it broke out. <i>The present war is the most beautiful Futurist poem which has so far been seen</i>; what Futurism signified was precisely the irruption of war into art, as embodied in the creation of the phenomenon of the Futurist Soirée (an extremely efficient means for propagating courage). Futurism was the militarization of innovating artists. Today we are witnessing an immense Futurist explosion of dynamic and aggressive contexts within which we soon wish to make our entrance and show what we are.[ . . . ]<br>
Fatherland = expansion + multiplication of the ego. Italian patriotism = to contain and feel in oneself the whole of Italy and all the Italians of tomorrow.<br>
<i>The War will sweep from the power all her foes: diplomats, professors, philosophers, archaeologists, critics, cultural obsession, Greek, Latin, history, senilism, museums, libraries, the tourist industry</i>. The War will promote gymnastics, sport, practical schools of agriculture, business, and industrialists. The War will rejuvenate Italy, will enrich her with men of action, will force her to live no longer off the past, off ruins and the mildj climate, but off her own national forces.<br>
