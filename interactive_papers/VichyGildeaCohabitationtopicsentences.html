<br>
(1) <i>In one of</i> the great classics of the Occupation, Vercors’s <i>Le Silence de la mer</i>,
finished in October 1941 and published by an underground press in Paris
early in 1942, a German officer, Werner von Ebrennac is billeted on a
French family comprising the narrator and a young woman, his niece. Each
evening, after his work at the local Kommandantur, the officer tries to
make conversation, saying how much he has always loved France, how
much French literature complements German music, how they should
unite as wife and husband, and how, as in <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, the love
of beautiful France will liberate the German from his beastly imprisonment
and reveal the handsome prince within. The niece, to whom these words
are subliminally directed, never raises her eyes from her sewing and never
speaks, the narrator continues to smoke his pipe, and the officer, confronted
by an unyielding silence, never sits down and soon withdraws with
the words, “Je vous souhaite une bonne nuit.” The story hinges on his visit
to Paris, where his friends are preparing the “wonderful union of our two
<b>(p.43)</b> peoples.” He returns, having met soldiers who experienced the horrors of
the Russ1an front and who have a totally different perspective on the
Franco-German relationship. He confides to the narrator and his niece 
that the soldiers laughed at his naïveté given the worldwide struggle for
power, pointing out that the real plan was not to seduce France but to
destroy it, body and soul, and ensure that she could never rise again,
“<i>Adieu</i>,” he declares and is gone the next morning, when silence descends 
on the narrator and his niece also.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a><br>
<br>
(2) Fifty-five years later I visited Marinette Rameau in her oak-beamed
family home in the Angevin countryside close to the Loire. Born in 1909, 
she might be the same age as the niece in <i>Le Silence de la mer</i>.<br>
<br>
(3) Marinette Rameau’s appreciation of the cultivation of the German military
was reinforced in May 1944 when “a French Apollo” turned up at the
house with an accommodation slip issued by the Kommandantur.<br>
<br>
(4) These stories of German officers billeted on French homes could
scarcely be more different.<br>
<br>
(5) The experience of Marinette Rameau of a succession of Germans billeted
on the family home was not necessarily typical.<br>
<br>
(6) Clearly, the impact of the German Occupation was very uneven.<br>
<br>
(7) In the towns, the Germans requisitioned public buildings such as barracks,
convents, schools and halls and also took over the hotels.<br>
<br>
(8) Some German lodgers, of course, were better than others.<br>
<br>
(9) It may be that to seek redress successfully from the occupying authorities
was unusual, but the Germans, while keeping the French on a tight leash,
were keen initially not to alienate them unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
(10) Although the formal relationship between Germans and French was
that of occupier and occupied, there were other ways of defining the relationship.
Since the armistice Germans and French were no longer at war,
but the war continued around them and in one sense made them both its
victims.<br>
<br>
(11) Michel Leterme’s father was a veteran of the 1914-18 war who, like
many graduates of the trenches, kept his helmet hanging up at home as a
badge of that confraternity.<br>
<br>
(12) It is true that German respect for French military honor severely 
dented in 1940.<br>
<br>
(13) For the German military this was not just a question of an appreciation
of French manners.<br>
<br>
(14) The Occupation opened up many possibilities for relations between
French women and German men but this did not mean that there were
no rules.<br>
<br>
(15) Some relationships between German soldiers and French women were
entirely bound by the codes of courtly love.<br>
<br>
(16) Receiving Germans at home was frowned on more than meeting them
in bars, cafés, and restaurants.<br>
<br>
(17) Sometimes during the Occupation itself members of the community 
complained that relations between French women and German soldiers 
were going too far.<br>
<br>
(18) Denunciation, from one perspective, was a patriotic act, bringing to the
attention of the authorities illegalities, disloyalties, and threats to the state
that might otherwise remain hidden.<br>
<br>
(19) An inquiry into “the incitation of minors to debauchery” was launched 
by the examining magistrate, Leopold Florens, and the <i>procureur de la
République</i> at Chinon, M. Ponset, but it did not get far.<br>
<br>
(20) The Kreiskommandant of Chinon made clear that he had quite a different
notion of where power lay.<br>
<br>
(21) Mme Longuépée’s malice was not exhausted by the arrest of Ponset,
who was in fact released by the Germans after three weeks on condition
that be move to a post in unoccupied France.<br>
<br>
(22) When the post office investigated the case, they found that there was
more to it than a vendetta between Mme Longuépée and Bagarie. <br>
<br>
(23) After a third incident in the space of five months, the French authorities
endeavored to recover control of the situation. <br>
<br>
(24) After her break with Chevalier and Longuépée, Simone Peltier went to
live in a nearby hamlet with a member of the collaborationist Milice named
Crosnier and then terrorized the local inhabitants by threatening to have
anyone who crossed her arrested by the Germans.<br>
<br>
(25) The view of the Germans that as victorious soldiers they had first claim
on French women did not go unchallenged by French men, especially in
the rough and tumble of Saturday nights, when drink flowed freely.<br>
<br>
(26) Between flirting, picking up girls, buying rounds, and paying for casual
sex, the lines were extremely fuzzy. Both French and German authorities
attempted to isolate prostitution from other relationships and regulate it
under well-established procedures for reasons of public health and public
order.<br>
<br>
(27) One problem with the regulation of prostitution was that the message
the Germans put out was ambivalent.<br>
<br>
(28) As the Occupation wore on, it became more and more difficult to deal
with prostitution and the public-order issues associated with it.<br>
<br>
(29) It was not only prostitution that blurred the lines of casual sex.<br>
<br>
(30) Cohabitation between French and Germans was as much about money
as about sex.<br>
<br>
(31) Inevitably things were not always as ordered as this.<br>
<br>
(32) Similar abuses went on in Nantes, where the Germans, having ruled
that all goods that had entered the port since 3 September 1939 were
legitimate war booty, confiscated stocks of tea, coffee, sugar, chocolate,
rice, and vegetable oil.<br>
<br>
(33) The French, who prided themselves on their Gallic cunning, found
many ways to get around the threat of requisition.<br>
<br>
(34) The Germans in general regarded France as a rich country but a backward
and unproductive one whose resources needed to be developed rationally
if exploitation on a long-term basis was to be a success.<br>
<br>
(35) One obsession of the German authorities was the amount of agricultural
land that lay fallow or abandoned.<br>
<br>
(36) The German authorities were concerned primarily with the economic
contribution the French could make but were also seduced by their artistic
treasures.<br>
<br>
(37) Even when military needs took precedence over art, the German
authorities were prepared to listen to arguments from the Ministry for
Industrial Production as to why certain statues of historic significance
should be preserved.<br>
<br>
(38) The contribution that France could make to the German war effort was
of course central, and it is clear that German production orders lifted the
French economy out of the recession into which it had been plunged after 
the defeat of 1940.<br>
<br>
(39) The experience of the small town of Cholet may serve as an example.
<br>
<br>
(40) The demand for finished goods soon began to outstrip the availability
of labor and materials and the Germans adopted a policy of concentration,
closing down smaller and less efficient firms to allow the larger units to
develop.<br>
<br>
(41) The biggest contractors in the region were the shipyards, railway works,
and aircraft factories of the Nantes/Saint-Nazaire area.<br>
<br>
(42) The German military machine required not only the delivery of military
hardware but also enormous building projects such as the Atlantic Wall to
fend off potential invasion and the construction of U-boat bases at Lorient
and Saint-Nazaire from which the campaign against Allied Atlantic convoys 
could be launched.<br>
<br>
(43) There has been much debate as to how free employers were to work
for the Reich and whether “economic collaboration” should be considered
in the same way as other forms of collaboration.<br>
<br>
(44) Those who profited included not only hardened speculators but ordinary
individuals with an eye for a good deal.<br>
<br>
(45) Some speculators had their fingers in a number of pies.<br>
<br>
(46) Occupied France was full of rags-to-riches stories along the lines of 
Jean Dutourd’s <i>Au Bon Beurre</i>. <br>
<br>
(47) The sullen rejection of the Germans represented by Vercors in <i>Le Silence
de la mer</i> has to be set against a more nuanced analysis of cohabitation
between French and Germans that held good at least for the first two years
of the Occupation. The image evoked by the historian Philippe Burrin of
the “blind town” refusing to make eye contact with the Germans was more
patriotic ideal than reality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> Beyond the power relations of French and
German authorities there were manifold private relations between French
and Germans that tended to revolve around money and sex. These relations
were not arbitrary but governed by rules negotiated between French and
Germans and among French people themselves. To receive Germans at home, for example, unless they were billeted, was felt to be different from
mingling with them in a public place under the public gaze. To accept 
German production orders openly was not the same thing as trafficking
with Germans on the black market. Very often the measure of what was
acceptable was its impact on the community: production orders might keep
the local economy afloat and people in work, whereas trafficking deprived
the locality of scarce resources. The impact of the Germans was not wholly
negative; naturally, they wished to exploit France’s resources to the full but
this sometimes entailed observing traditional practices and eliminating vermin
and pests. It has also been calculated that Germans did their bit to
tackle France’s demographic deficit by fathering between 50,000 and
70,000 children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> Perspectives also changed with time, so that practices
tolerated by communities weakened by evacuation and the absence of
POWs in 1940 were judged harshly in 1944 when communities were seeking
to rebuild themselves after the Liberation. Sexual misdemeanors were
punished more harshly than economic collaboration, partly because they
might be linked to intelligence of the enemy and the denunciation of compatriots,
partly because the threat to family, community, and male honor 
was felt to be much greater. The perspective of 1944 should not, however,
prevent us from remembering that in many respects occupied France was
another country where they did things differently.<br>
