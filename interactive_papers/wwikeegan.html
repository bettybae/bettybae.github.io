JOHN KEEGAN, <i>THE FACE OF BATTLE</i> (New York: The Viking Press, 1976)<br>
<br>
<b>In memory of my father and my father-in-law</b><br>
<br>
<b>(p.204)</b><br>
<br>
<b>4</b><br>
<br>
<b>The Somme, July 1st, 1916</b><br>
<br>
<center><b><i>The Battlefield</center></b></i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Somme- French department formed from part of Picardy;
prefecture: Amiens; sub-prefectures: Abbeville, Montdidier,
Péronne; 4 arrondissements, 41 cantons, 835 communes;
court of appeal and episcopal seat at Amiens; the department
takes its name from the river which waters it</blockquote>
<br>
‘Lethargically,’ one feels like adding. For the Somme is a slow-moving
river, winding its weed-choked way through a peat-bottomed
valley below beech woods and bare chalk downland.
The countryside, too, is slow-moving, under the gaze of the
traveler who takes one of the long Roman roads which radiate
north-east, east and south-east from Amiens. Low plateaux and
ridges, separated by the shallow valleys of the Somme’s tributaries,
the Aire, Ancre, Noye, Avre, Buce, succeed each other
monotonously, devoid of hedges and almost of woodland,
thickly populated, intensely cultivated. Between the Noye and
the Somme itself, in the plain of Santerre, the land is completely
flat and yields the most characteristic of the department’s
crops, sugar beet, dull to contemplate, heavy to work, rich to
harvest. In September the roads of the Santerre are slippery
with mud (‘Attention! -Betteraves’) when the clay-smeared beet
are hauled to the little refineries whose tall, single chimneys
mark the villages of the plain; in October the refinery-owners
summon their neighbours to shoot partridge and hare among
the furrows and sit down in the evening a hundred strong to eat
the bag; in November enormous ploughs emerge from the
machinery sheds to be dragged on cables between stationary
<b>(p.205)</b>
traction engines across the mile-wide fields. The pace of life on
the Somme is as slow as its rivers, as regular as its natural features. <br>
<br>
But as ploughing proceeds, little dumps of foreign objects
appear along the verges of the roads. Rusty, misshapen, dirt encrusted,
these cones and globes reveal themselves, at a closer
look, to be the fruit not of agriculture but of war; trench
mortar bombs, howitzer shells, aerial torpedoes - eight-inch,
seventy-fives, seventy-sevens, eighteen-pounders, 21 mm, Jack
Johnsons, coal boxes, whizz-bangs -veterans identify them in
the language of sixty years ago with unhesitant certitude,
though they approach the dumps with respectful caution. At
the end of the ploughing season, bomb disposal officers of the
French army arrive to remove the relics to a spot where they
can be safely detonated. Occasionally an officer is killed. Even
after sixty years, the fuses of these ‘duds’ and ‘blinds’ remain
activated, the charges they contain explosive. <br>
<br>
Bomb-disposal officers are killed also in Belgium, along the
banks of the Yser and on the low crescent ofheights which ring
Ypres to the east; and, on French soil, south of the Somme, in
the vineyards of Champagne and in the wheatlands of Lorraine.
But the dumps which accumulate on the Somme differ in two
respects from those with which bomb-disposal officers have to
deal elsewhere. First, the heaps are bigger. The Somme was not
the most heavily shelled of the Western Front battlefields. In
terms of shells per square yard, that cachet belongs to Verdun;
in duration of shelling it belongs to the heights of the Aisne and
the Chemin des Dames; in remorselessness it belongs to the
Ypres salient. But for a variety of reasons, dud shells do not resurface
in anything like the same numbers on other battlefields
as they do on the Somme. Around Verdun and in the Argonne,
another heavily shelled sector, little of the ground is worked; as
on the slopes of the Vosges, it was covered with forest before the
war and has been replanted since. In the Champagne, historically
the principal training ground of the French army, large
areas have always been used for artillery practice, and the duds
of the First World War, merely adding to the existing hazards,
attract little attention. The high chalklands of Artois, up whose
slopes the French, and later the British and Canadians, struggled
towards the crests of Vimy and Notre Dame de Lorette, are
now back again under pasture; while in Flanders, the glutinous
<b>(p.206)</b>
soil swallows the jetsam, as it has swallowed the concrete pillboxes
with which Hindenburg sought to fence the British and
Belgians into the Ypres salient and the water-logged valleys of
the Lys and Yser. It is the Somme, therefore, with its busy
agriculture and light, friable soil, which most plentifully throws
up the dangerous debris of the great offensives. <br>
<br>
Most of this debris is British- and this is the second respect in
which the Somme dumps differ from those accumulated north
or southwards. For the Somme was, in a way true of no other
battlefield of the First World War, British territory. Ypres, of
course, became during the war almost the corner of a native
field; and, with its British church, English-speaking pubs (‘Bass
on draft’), English school for the children of the Commonwealth
War Graves’ gardeners and plethora of county regimental
memorials, remains so. But it was always a tiny battlefield into
which Haig, even at the height of his offensive obsessions, found
it difficult to squeeze more than half a dozen divisions for an
attack. The British, moreover, won no victories at Ypres, except
that curious victory of the spirit which, over half a century
later, still plucks back the survivors of the Salient to stand in
silence beneath the tomblike arches of the Menin Gate and hear
the evening Last Post blown, or sit under the willows in the
Ramparts cemetery, where lawns grow over the roofofthe Lille
Gate dressing-station and bodies carried from it lie ranked
beneath the turf. The Somme, by contrast, offered an immensely
long front of attack on which twenty divisions could assault
side by side. And, for all the miseries suffered there, it was also
a front which brought its triumphs. On it the British drove the
first tanks into action, in the ruined village of Flers, on September
15th, I916. Two years later, they organized before Amiens
the first great armoured breakthrough of modern warfare. And
earlier in the year of 1918 they had, after the terrifying and
almost total collapse of one of their armies, brought to a halt
near the city the greatest of Hindenburg’s ‘war-winning’ offensives.
It was these battles, together with the long periods of
garrison duty intervening between them, which made the
Somme a British, rather than a French, Belgian or American
sector. The Americans would eventually come to think of the
Argonne, that awful wilderness of shredded woods and chokedup
streams, as ‘their’ battleground, as did the Belgians the Yser,
<b>(p.207)</b>
on which they were to wage a semi-aquatic war for nearly four
years. The French, who had poured out their blood along each
mile of the five hundred between Nieuport and Switzerland,
considered half a dozen points on the Western Front as champs
d’honneur particularly their own- Verdun, of course, but also
the Chemin des Dames (it was for the vistas of the Aisne it
offered that Louis XV had had built for his daughters the road
which gave the ridge its name), Tahure and the Main de
Massiges in Champagne, Les Eparges in the St Mihiel salient
(later also the scene of an American offensive) and Sainte Marie
aux Mines and the Hartmannswillerkopf (le vieil Armand) in the
high Vosges, over which Chasseurs alpins and Jiiger squandered
their special mountain-warfare skills during I915. MortHomme,
Côte 304, Neuville St-Vaast, Somme-Puy, Malmaison,
Moulin de Laffaux- it was the struggles for such unregarded
corners of the homeland as these which made them ‘French’ in
a way they had not been before. In the same way it was the
battles of 1916 and 1918-Bazentin, Pozieres, Morval, Thiepval,
Transloy, Villers Bretonneux- which made the Somme
‘British’. But none more so than the first battle, the Battle of
Albert, and its first day, July 1st, 1916. <br>
<br>
The Somme, in 1916, was new territory for much of the
British army. In mid-1915 a small sector north of the river had
been taken over by the embryo Third Army, as part of the
Allies’ agreed policy of reducing the length of front held by the
French, but the bulk of the British Expeditionary Force had
remained in Flanders. As its size increased, it had extended its
front southwards, but only far enough to cross the wet levels of
the River Lys into the dreary coalfields east of Lille, where
during 1915 it fought a series of minor, murderous trench-to-trench
battles-Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, Festubert, Givenchy-
and mounted one major, miscarried offensive at Loos.
All had been characterized by the extreme ferocity of the fighting
and the miserable physical conditions which the terrain
imposed. Between Ypres and Armentières, water is found everywhere
close beneath the surface and much of the line had to be
constructed of sandbag barricades instead of trenches. Almost
everywhere, too, the Germans occupied what commanding
heights there were: near Ypres, the Paschendaele and Messines
ridges; in the coalfields, most of the slag-heaps and, until they
<b>(p.208)</b>
were destroyed, the pithead towers. Compelled to struggle for
possession of the higher, drier ground, the British had driven
their lines in many places almost to within conversational
distance of the Germans’; at Spanbroekmoelen, south of Ypres,
the trenches were separated by a single fence of ‘international’
wire, which each garrison mended from opposite sides under
cover of darkness. But despite the heavy and continuous toll of
losses- about goo a day- which this physical intimacy and
constant attack cost the British, Flanders had become a sort of
home for the B.E.F. Behind the lines- and battalions left the
trenches at regular and quite frequent intervals for ‘rest’- the
villages provided roofs, straw, beer, pommes frites, fields for
football. As peasants learnt to profiteer, the army and churches
erected canteen huts, where the beer was both cheaper and
stronger, and tea, something the locals never got the hang of
brewing, was on tap. Farther back, in the little Flemish market
towns, Poperinghe- ‘Pop’, Bailleul, Bethune, cafes and restaurants
thrived, collecting clienteles of young officers who
would ride over in groups to celebrate a spell out of the line on
comfortable chairs at well-laid tables. Other little calling places
had begun to make a name : clubs where concert-parties, over
from England or got up by divisions, performed; spiritual ports
of call, like the famous Talbot House (Toe H, in the war’s
phonetics) in Poperinghe where all visitors shed their rank; profane
addresses which officers entered furtively or not at all. The
geography of West Flanders, Nord and Pas de Calais, had thus,
by the end of 1915, become extremely familiar to the B.E.F. Its
network of roads, turnings, crossings (already much engineered
and improved), was imprinted on the army’s mental map, and
its place-names had been Tommified over a large area, not only
those of the larger spots whose soldier-equivalents were wellknown
at home - Armenteers, Wipers (Ypres), Vlam (Vlamertinghe),
Eetaps (Etaples)- but of many quite tiny features of
purely local tactical importance. The Tommy’s names for a few
of them had a wide currency- Plugstreet (Ploegsteert) Wood
and Whitesheet (Wytschaete)- but most formed a private code:
Tram Car Cottage, Battersea Farm, Glencorse Wood, Beggar’s
Rest, Apple Villa, White Horse Cellars, Kansas Cross, Doll’s
House. The origin of most of the names, bestowed during the
B.E.F.’s moment of epic in October and November, 1914, had
<b>(p.209)</b>
already been forgotten by the following summer. By the end
of 1917, the places which they signified would themselves have
been obliterated. But the names would still pass from mouth to
mouth as new battalions relieved old among the slag-heaps,
along the stream-bottoms, in the vanished woods. <br>
<br>
The Somme, therefore, was country to be mistrusted by the
divisions which came south to it in March 1916. These short
sectors which had been held since the previous summer by the
Third Army looked familiar to the new Fourth: the trenches
were properly house-kept and laid out as per regulation, with
continuous belts of wire in front, a parapet and a parados, traverses
- those regular kinks in the line which prevented an
attacker gaining possession of one stretch from shooting down its
whole length, and a support and a reserve line at the proper
distance-the one, two hundred yards back; the other, four
hundred back again- connected to the front by communication
trenches. Thus accommodated, the brigades of the Fourth
Army could look forward to organizing a proper trench routine,
rotating each of their four battalions between front, reserve and
rest on a sixteen-day cycle. But the divisions of the Third,
which, by a sideways move, inherited a sector vacated by the
French, were at a loss. Their predecessors, by all the evidence,
had not been conducting trench warfare at all, not at least as
its rules were understood in the B.E.F. Flowers had been allowed
to overgrow the parapets of the trenches- the 1 /4th Ox and
Bucks took over a ‘Marguerite Trench’ from the French- which
in many places were not truly continuous, but organized as
independent ‘positions’, comfortable to occupy, at least for a
small garrison, with their little scrapes in the trench walls and
wattle-shelters in the corners of the traverses, but ill-adapted
for raiding or for solid battalion defence. <br>
<br>
And the truth indeed was that the French had not been
waging trench warfare on the Somme. For them, it was an
‘inactive’ sector which they were content to hold with the minimum
of infantrymen in the front line, using their plentiful corps
and divisional artilleries of seventy-five millimetre guns to warn
off the Germans should they menace an attack. But the Germans
opposite had never put them to the trouble. For their high
command also was content to regard the Somme as a quiet
sector, leaving it in the hands of reserve divisions which might
<b>(p.210)</b>
be allowed an easy life as long as they improved their front- by
digging and wiring- and kept the French on the right side of
no-man’s-land. Some of the German divisions on the Somme
had, in consequence, been there since September 1914 with the
loss of scarcely a man, except among the contingents which
they were occasionally obliged to detach when the Allies
attacked in Flanders or Champagne. <br>
<br>
<center><b><i>The Plan</i></b></center><br>
<br>
All this was about to be changed. Since December 1915, the
French and British had been planning a great offensive on the
Western Front and the sector they had chosen for it was that
‘athwart the Somme’. This was not to be the first offensive seen
in the west. Indeed the S-like trace of the Western Front was
itself the product of a series of offensives in 1914. The earliest,
mounted by the French into Lorraine, had fixed the lower loop
of the S along the line of the Vosges and the River Meurthe;
the second, mounted by the Germans in conformity with the
dead maestro Schlieffen’s plan, and hinging on Verdun, had
planted the centre of the S on the Aisne- though it had hovered
for a week on the Marne; the third, a running battle between
French and Germans, known as the Race to the Sea and fought
up the rungs of the parallel main railway lines of north-eastern
France, across the departments of the Oise, Somme, Pas de
Calais and Nord, had ultimately planted the upper loop of the
S on the River Yser. There, in October and November, in the
only gap of open front remaining in the west, the French,
British, Belgians and Germans had worried the last gasps of life
out of their hopes of quick victory. Henceforth, if they were to
seek a decision, it would be found on the far side of the trench line. <br>
<br>
But much of the terrain which the trench line crossed was
unsuitable for decisive operations. North of Ypres, both sides
were prisoners of the floods; south of Verdun the proximity of
rivers, forests or mountains threatened a rapid check to any
advance, even ifit could be initiated; between the Oise and the
Aisne, in the dead centre, steep river valleys likewise offered
little prospect of breakthrough; and there were a number of
<b>(p.211)</b>
other unpromising stretches- the valley of the Lys, south of
Ypres, and the forest of the Argonne, west of Verdun. The
narrowness of suitable attacking front left after these sectors had
been subtracted from the whole mattered little to the Germans,
for they, once fully persuaded of the failure of the ‘war-winning’
Schlieffen plan, were content to stand on the defensive in the
west while they won victories over the Russians. But it mattered
a great deal to the French, whose national honour was in pawn
to the Germans, together with much of their national wealth;
and to the British, who, as the numbers in their armies grew,
needed a battlefield on which to make their strength - and their
commitment to the common cause- felt. <br>
<br>
By any sensible strategic reckoning, there were only three
sectors where the lie of the land and the direction of the railways
so ran as to favour an Allied attack; the Somme, Artois and the
Champagne. During 1915 it was upon the last two that they
concentrated their forces. Both offered high, dry, chalky going
and a hinterland across which an advance might be carried at
speed if the trench line could be broken. But it was less the nature
of the terrain than their relationship to each other which
recommended these battlefields to French high command.
Grasping still after the decisive battle of which he had been
cheated in 1914, Joffre insisted on seeing the Western Front as
a ‘theatre of operations’ rather than the fortified position which
it truly was, and its central section therefore as ‘major salient’.
In that the front between Verdun and Ypres ran in a rough
semi-circle, forming the upper loop of the whole S, a salient it
was, with its northern root in Artois and its southern in Champagne.
It was an illusion, however, soon to be demonstrated as
such, that an attack on the major salient was the right strategy
or that the conventional method of dealing with a salient-by
simultaneous attacks at the roots- would work in the circumstances
of 1915. There were many reasons why not. Some were
to be glimpsed in the French spring offensive of I 9 I 5, known as
the Second Battle of Artois, which failed to capture Vimy Ridge.
More were to be revealed, and more fully, in the Septembc:r
battle, a truly joint offensive between the French, attacking
in Champagne, and a pair of British and French armies,
which attacked side by side in Artois; the French again failed
to carry the Vimy position, the British just got possession of the
<b>(p.212)</b>
village of Loos (having hoped to create the conditions for a
cavalry breakthrough), while the major French offensive in
Champagne-the last in which they assaulted behind colours
and bands- dissipated itself in blood and misery on the slopes
of Tahure and the Main de Massiges. <br>
<br>
Allied strategy for I9I6 required, therefore, a new offensive
plan. Joffre decided, moreover, that it needed a new front. This
was due in part to his growing recognition that a front which
had been attacked was so ‘thickened up’ in the process- cauterized
and criss-crossed with a scar-tissue of new and old trenches
-that a renewal of the assault on the same spot carried a
diminishing prospect of success; but in greater part to his desire
to involve the British in a major offensive effort in I9I6. In
suspecting their disinclination to be involved, he did them an
injustice; in supposing that their choice of location for an
offensive might not serve his Grand Strategy, he was on to something.
Haig, who had made his reputation by his defence of
Ypres in late 1914, had, as soon as he assumed command of the
B.E.F. in December 1915, set his staff to plan for the next
great British offensive to take place there again. In selecting the
Somme front, which was where the French and British sectors
touched, as the focus of Allied efforts for 1916, Joffre was at
least to ensure that those efforts would be jointly directed
towards the defeat of the German army on French soil and
under his hand- even if the method by which it would be
defeated was, as he was coming privately to accept, that of
usure- attrition- rather than the breakthrough in which the
British still hoped and believed. <br>
<br>
Attrition is a game at which two can play. Both the British
and French had too long and easily taken for granted that the
German posture on the Western Front was a defensive one. It
was almost as great a psychological as physical shock, therefore,
when in mid-February 19I6 the Germans opened a major and
quite unexpected offensive at Verdun, the lower hinge of the
Western Front. From the outset the French rightly grasped that
its object was to impose upon them the necessity either of making
a humiliating withdrawal or of bearing a prolonged
butchery. The French settled for butchery; but from the date
of the offensive’s outbreak, their discussions with the British
lost their academic, almost reflective pace and took an urgency
<b>(p.213)</b>
which became more and more desperate as the numbers of
French lives lost at Verdun grew. Death or wounds had taken
90,000 Frenchmen by the end of March, only six weeks after the
offensive had begun. In May, when Joffre came to visit Haig
in his headquarters, it was calculated that losses would have
risen to 2oo,ooo by the end of that month. Haig conceded the
need to fix an early date of the opening of the Somme offensive;
he indicated the period from July I to August I 5· At the mention
of the later date, Joffre, extremely agitated, burst out that
‘the French army would cease to exist’ if nothing had been
done by that date. On the spot, the two generals settled for
July I. The British would attack with a dozen divisions north
of the river, the French with twenty to the south. <br>
<br>
<center><b><i>The Preparations</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Haig’s planners now busied themselves with fixing the final details.
Throughout the earlier part of the year, they had been
creating behind the Somme front the infrastructure of roads,
railway spurs, camps, hospitals, water-pumping stations, supply
dumps and transport parks without which a deliberate offensive
could not be mounted in an industrial age. The most important
end-product of this labour was the accumulation of artillery
ammunition, of which 2,g6o,ooo rounds had been dumped
forward. (By way of comparison, Napoleon probably had about
2o,ooo rounds with his guns at Waterloo.) Consequently, the
most important element of the attack plan was the artillery
programme. It was divided into two. The first instalment was
to be a week-long bombardment of the German line, concentrating
on the trenches occupied by the garrison but also reaching
back to ‘interdict’ -deny the use of- the approach routes
to those trenches, where those routes could be reached. The
second instalment was to be the barrage. This word, the meaning
of which has since been smothered in English by the weight
of historical allusion attaching to it, was new to the British in
I9I6. Borrowed from the French, who use it to signify both a
turnpike barrier and a dam (whence it has been taken into
English by another route), it literally has the force of meaning
<b>(p.214)</b>
‘preventing movement’. And such was the desired function of
the tir de barrage; ‘barrage fire’ was a curtain of exploding shells
which preceded the advance of the infantry, preventing the
enemy infantry from moving from their positions of shelter to
their positions of defence until it was too late to oppose the
attackers’ advance. In strict artillery theory, the barrage, by
carefully timed ‘lifts’, could take the body of infantry it was
protecting clean through an enemy position without their
suffering a single loss from enemy infantry fire. <br>
<br>
The only theoretical limit on the protection the barrage could
offer was imposed by the range of the guns firing it- which
meant that beyond about six thousand yards from the gun-line,
say five thousand from the front trench, the infantry could not
count on the artillery’s fire reaching ground they wished to
traverse. In practice ‘effective’ ranges were regarded as rather
shorter- ‘effective’ having changed its meaning since Waterloo.
There, as we saw, it meant ‘making an effect on the enemy’,
something shot would not do at long range because it quickly
lost its killing velocity and accuracy. By 1916, when better technology
had improved velocity and accuracy ten-fold, and the
bursting charge had made shells lethal even at extreme range,
‘effective’ fire really meant ‘observable’ fire, fire which fell
within sight of an observation officer who could communicate
with his battery and correct its guns’ deflection and elevation.
He was expected to keep close behind the attacking infantryhe
was also expected to be able to keep his telephone cable to
his battery intact, a much more doubtful expectation- and the
limit on the effectiveness of fire, therefore, was that imposed by
his ability accurately to spot the fall of shot. If we estimate his
effective range of vision at a thousand yards, and his distance
from the leading infantry also at a thousand, we arrive at an
‘effective’ range for the barrage of about four thousand yards
from the front trench. <br>
<br>
This was almost exactly the maximum distance set for the
advance of each of the infantry formations on July 1st, which is
not surprising, for ‘objectives’ were arrived at by exactly these
mathematics. On some divisional fronts, final objectives were
closer to the British front line if the German front position was
closer. On less than half the front, however, did objectives fall
on the German second position, the siting of which the Germans
<b>(p.215)</b>
had, of course, determined by the same calculations of artillery
ranges which underlay the planning of the British attack. The
British infantry were, therefore, being asked to commit themselves
to an offensive of which the outcome, even if completely
successful, would leave the Germans still largely in possession of
a second and completely independent system of fortification untouched
by the attack. Its capture would require the hauling
forward of all the impedimenta of bombardment and the repetition
of the opening assault on another day, at another hour.
That they were not daunted by this prospect is explained in
part by the briefing that the staff had given to the regimental
officers, and the officers to their men: that the real work of
destruction, both of the enemy’s defences and men, would have
been done by the artillery before zero hour; that the enemy’s
wire would have been scythed flat, his batteries battered into
silence and his trench-garrisons entombed in their dug-outs;
that the main task of the infantry would be merely to walk
forward to the objectives which the officers had marked on their
maps, moderating their pace to that of the barrage moving
ahead of them; finally, that once arrived there, they had only to
install themselves in the German reserve trenches to be in
perfect safety. Had anyone yet coined the phrase, ‘Artillery
conquers, infantry occupies’ it would have been on everyone’s
lips. Or would it? For the better explanation of the army’s
optimism was that it was a trusting army. It believed in the
reassurances proffered by the staff who, to be fair, believed them
also. It believed in the superiority of its own equipment over
the Germans’. It believed in the dedication and fearlessness of
its battalion officers- and was right so to believe. But it believed
above all in itself. <br>
<br>
<center><b><i>The Army</i></b></center><br>
<br>
The British Expeditionary Force of 1916 was one of the most
remarkable and admirable military formations ever to have
taken the field, and the Fourth and Third Armies, which were
to attack the Somme, provided a perfect cross-section of the
sort of units which composed it. Four of the thirteen attacking
divisions were regular, were wholly or largely formed, that is. of
long-service volunteer soldiers. The 4th Division demonstrated
what type of formation this was. All its twelve battalions of
fighting infantry were old-sweat units, two Irish, one Scottish,
five Midland or North Country, two West Country, one East
Anglian, one London; and, despite continuous action since the
Battle of Mons in August I 9 I 4, many of their experienced prewar
officers and N.C.O.s still survived. The 7th and 8th
Divisions were less completely regular, containing as each did
a war-raised ‘Kitchener’ brigade (three brigades of four battalions
made a division) but were distinctively regular in spirit.
This was true, too, of the 29th Division, which contained two
war-raised units- the so-called Public Schools Battalion and
the N ewtoundland Regiment- but was composed otherwise of
the toughest old-sweat battalions, those which had been overseas
on imperial garrison duty in August 1914. Three of the
‘Kitchener’ divisions also contained regular battalions, the
21st, 30th and 32nd, having one in each of its brigades; the rest
of their infantry, like all that in the 18th, 31st, 34th and 36th
Divisions, was ‘Kitchener’ or ‘New Army’. What made these
battalions- 97 out of the I 43 destined for the attack- so
worthy of note? <br>
<br>
First, that they were formed of volunteers. The regular
battalions were also raised by voluntary enlistment, but the impulsion
which drove a pre-war civilian to join up for ‘seven and
five’ -seven years with the colours, five on the reserve- was
most often that of simple poverty. ‘I would rather bury you
than see you in a red coat’ were the words his mother wrote to
William Robertson, a ranker who became a field-marshal, on
hearing of his enlistment, and they tell us all we need to know
about what a respectable Victorian working-class family felt at
a son joining the army. Almost any other sort of employment
was thought preferable, for soldiering meant exile, low company,
drunkenness or its danger, the surrender of all chance of
marriage- the removal, in short, of every gentle or improving
influence upon which the Victorian poor had been taught to
set such store. It is against this background that we must review
the extraordinary enthusiasm to enlist which seized the male
population of the British Isles in the autumn of I 9 I 4 and provided
the army, in a little under six months, with nearly two
million volunteer soldiers. 
<b>(p.218)</b>
Among the first hundred thousand - for administrative convenience,
the volunteers were called for in batches of that
number- many who joined up were without work, there being,
for example, a serious slump in the building trade in the summer
of 1914. Some might, therefore, have been eventually impelled
into the army, while others perhaps used the pretext of a
national emergency to camouflage a personal one and to justify
the breaking of a taboo. But, from the outset, many surrendered
well-paid, steady employment to join up, coming forward in
such numbers that they overwhelmed the capacity of the army
to clothe, arm and train them. Kitchener, hastily appointed
Secretary of State for War, had originally called for a single
increment of a hundred thousand men to the strength of the
regular army. He was, by the spring of 1915, to find himself
with six of these ‘hundred thousands’, from which he formed
five ‘New Armies’, each of six divisions. The two original
‘hundred thousands’ provided two series of six symmetrical
divisions, reflecting and to a large extent corresponding with
the regional division of the country: 9th and 15th were called
Scottish, 10th and I 6th Irish, I I th and I 7th Northern, I 2th and
I 8th Eastern, 13th and 19th Western and I 4th and 20th Light
(formed from Londoners and other southerners into battalions
of the rifle and light infantry regiments). But the sheer weight
of the recruiting flood soon washed away the very flimsy framework
of organization within which the War Office tried to contain
it. The facts of demography, too, worked against their
scheme, for the population of the British Isles did not neatly
divide into six. The great reserves of manpower were in the
northern and midland cities and in London, and it was this
pattern which began to tell in the third, fourth and subsequent
‘hundred thousands’. The men who had come forward in these
waves chose their own titles for their units, in some cases their
own officers, in almost every case their own comrades. These
were the men who formed the ‘Pals’ Battalions’. <br>
<br>
Perhaps no story of the First World War is as poignant as
that of the Pals. It is a story of a spontaneous and genuinely
popular mass movement which has no counterpart in the
modern, English-speaking world and perhaps could have none
outside its own time and place: a time of intense, almost
mystical patriotism, and of the inarticulate elitism of an 
imperial power’s working class; a place of vigorous and buoyant
urban life, rich in differences and in a sense of belonging- to
work-places, to factories, to unions, to churches, chapels, charitable
organizations, benefit clubs, Boy Scouts, Boys’ Brigades,
Sunday Schools, cricket, football, rugby, skittle clubs, old
boys’ societies, city offices, municipal departments, craft guilds-to
any one of those hundreds of bodies from which the Edwardian
Briton drew his security and sense of identity. This
network of associations offered an emotional leverage on British
male responses which the committees of ‘raisers’, middle-aged,
and self-appointed in the first flush of enthusiasm for the war,
were quick to manipulate, without perhaps realizing its power.
First among these men was the Earl of Derby who, in his role
as caudillo of the commercial north-east, called in late August
191 4 on the young men of Liverpool’s business offices to raise a
battalion for the New Army, promising that he had Kitchener’s
guarantee that those who ‘joined together should serve together’.
The numbers for the battalion were found at the first
recruiting rally, and the overflow provided two others. The
clerks of the White Star shipping company formed up as one
platoon, those of Cunard as another, the Cotton Exchange
staff, banks, insurance companies, warehouses contributing
other contingents, so that between Friday, August 28th and
Tuesday, September 3rd a whole brigade of four infantry
battalions- four thousand young men- had been found. They
called themselves the xst, 2nd, 3rd and 4th City of Liverpool
Battalions; later the War Office would allot them the more
official title of 17th, 18th, 19th and 2oth Battalions, King’s
(Liverpool) Regiment, thus accommodating them within the
conventional regimental structure of the peace-time army, and
designate them the 89th Brigade of the 30th Division. But they
would continue to think of themselves as the Liverpool Pals. <br>
<br>
And the Pals idea at once caught hold of the imagination of
communities much smaller, less self-confident, less commercially
dominant than Liverpool. Accrington, the little East Lancashire
cotton town, and Grimsby, the North Sea fishing port, shordy
produced their Pals, Llandudno and Blaenaw Festiniog, the
Welsh holiday resorts another, the London slum boroughs of
Shoreditch, Islington, West Ham and Bermondsey theirs.
Artillery brigades were raised in Camberwell, Wearside, Burn-
<b>(p.219)</b>
ley, Lee Green, Lytham St Anne’s; Royal Engineer field companies
in Tottenham, Cambridge, Barnsley, Ripon, and units
arose with sub-tides like North-east Railway, xst Football,
Church Lads, xst Public Works, Empire, Arts and Crafts,
Forest of Dean Pioneers, Bankers, British Empire League,
Miners. Miners, who numbered 1.2 million in 1914, about six
per cent of the employed population, and whose places of work
were concentrated almost exclusively in the West Midlands,
South Wales, the North-East and the Scottish Lowlands, provided
a disproportionately large number of the recruits and of
the units they would eventually form. So many were physically
stunted that at first they failed the army’s height requirement;
but being otherwise robust were later formed into special
‘Bantam’ units, for which the height requirement was reduced
to between 5’ and 5’ 3”. The spectacle of these uniformed
midgets in training touched the lowest strain of sentimentality
in Run-hating journalists, while many of the recruits, sharing
nothing with the miners but their lack of stature, turned out
poor fighting material and their units with them. But these were
the exception. In physique, in subordination, in motivation, in
readiness for self-sacrifice, the soldiers of the Kitchener armies,
‘citizen soldiers’ as the propaganda of the period, for once
getting its categories right, called them, were unsurpassed, and
were matched in quality only by the magnificent volunteer
contingents provided by the white Dominions, and by the
Ersatz Corps of German university and high-school students who
had paid the price of going untrained to war in the KinderTTUJrd*
at Ypres in October and November 1914. <br>
<br>
The Kindermord, had the Kitchener soldiers grasped its import,
offered them an awful warning, for the Ersatz Corps,
which outnumbered the tiny B.E.F. of 1914, had been beaten
by the superior military technique of war-hardened soldiers.
The Kitchener battalions had on formation, and for many
months afterwards, no knowledge of military technique whatsoever.
Indeed ‘battalions’, which implies an irreducible minimum
of military organization, is a misnomer. Some ‘battalions’
entered into military existence when a train load of a thousand
volunteers was tipped out on to a rural railway platform in front
of a single officer who had been designated to command it. Few
<b>(p.220)</b>
of these battalions, beyond those of the first two ‘hundred
thousands’, were allotted more than three officers and three
regular N.C.O.s, and those were often second-raters-retired
Indian cavalrymen, militia colonels, disabled pensioners. Occasionally
the choice was more promising (though ‘choice’ of
course was sharply limited by the need to keep every fit and
able officer in France) and the more intelligent of these instant
commanding officers would send the men off in small groups
for a few minutes to elect their own junior leaders, or would
call for those with some experience of supervising others to
accept probationary rank. Egalitarian though the mood of the
Kitchener armies very distinctively was, appeals of this sort
generally produced candidates, often ones whose authority
was readily accepted by their fellows and could eventually be
confirmed. <br>
<br>
But although this method yielded N.C.O.s, it did not do
much to officer the new armies. The War Office was unwilling
to grant commissions unless aspirants could prove their suitability,
and although it devolved the power to adjudicate on to
the local ‘raisers’, it and they shared common criteria of what
‘suitable’ meant. Officers had to be gentlemen. But just as the
distribution of manpower failed to mesh with the regimental
organization of the British army, so too did the social with the
human geography of the country. Britain in 1914 was as sharply
Two Nations as it had been seventy years before, so that throughout
the industrial North, the West Midlands, South Wales and
Lowland Scotland existed populous and productive communities
almost wholly without a professional stratum and so without
an officer class. Young men with the necessary qualifications - possession
of the Certificate A or B granted by an Officer
Training Corps was usually stipulated, though education at one
of the public or better grammar schools which ran an O.T.C.
was in practice often found sufficient*- were concentrated in the


• R. C. Sherriff, author of Journey’s End, describes his first attempt to
become an officer in August 1914: ‘“School?” inquired the adjutant. I
told him and his face fell. He took up a printed list and searched through
it. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but I’m afraid it isn’t a public school.” I was
mystified. I told him that my school, though small, was a very old and good
one- founded, I said, by Queen Elizabeth in 1567. The adjutant was not
impressed. He had lost all interest in me. “I’m sorry,” he repeated. 
“But our instructions are that all applicants for commissions must be selected
from the recognized public schools and yours is not among them.” And that
was that. It was a long, hard pull before I was at last accepted as an
officer. Only then because the prodigious loss of officers in France had
forced the authorities to lower their sights and accept young men outside
the exclusive circle!’

<b>(p.221)</b>
south and west and in half a dozen major cities. Thus there
came about, during the first two years of the First World War,
one of the most curious social confrontations in British history
and, in its long-term political implications, one of the most significant.
It was almost always a meeting of strangers. It was
sometimes a meeting of near foreigners. John Masters, in his
description of his joining the 4th Gurkha Rifles of the old
British Indian Army in the nineteen-thirties, has marvellously
evoked the mutual incomprehension, good-humoured but absolute,
which took hold of a platoon and its new officer, fresh
from England, when first they met. Something very similar fell
upon the Kitchener armies in the winter of 1914 when nicely
raised young men from West Country vicarages or South Coast
watering-places came face to face with forty Durham miners,
Yorkshire furnacemen, Clydeside riveters, and the two sides
found that they could scarcely understand each other’s speech.
It was only the ardent desire on the one hand to teach, to
encourage, to be accepted, on the other to learn and to be led
which made intercourse between them possible. In this process
of discovery, both of each other and of the military life, many
of the amateur officers were to conceive an affection and concern
for the disadvantaged which would eventually fuel that
transformation of middle-class attitudes to the poor which has
been the most important social trend in twentieth-century
Britain.* Many of the Kitchener Tommies were to perceive in
their officers’ display of fellow-feeling an authenticity which
would make attendance on that transformation tolerable. But
by what strange communion did these feelings transmit themselves!
Siegfried Sassoon has described how his own life was

changed by the expression of total trust and self-surrender
visible in the faces of his men, looking up at him as they
squatted cross-legged, while he inspected their feet after a
route march. <br>
<br>
Inspecting sore feet was one of those rituals of the regular
army into which the Kitchener officers were earliest initiated,
partly because its dotty dissimilarity from anything they had
known in civilian life convinced their seniors that it was the
right thing to make the subalterns do- as indeed it was in those
days of unmechanical warfare, when tactical mobility depended
upon marching endurance and untended blisters could
cripple a whole battalion- and partly because route-marching
was, in the first months of their existence, almost the sole form
of training of which the Kitchener divisions could get their fill.
For many months rifles, even uniforms were lacking, so that the
Pals’ battalions could neither learn the trade of soldiers nor
simulate their appearance. Only by endless drilling and marching
in formation were these thousands of unblooded volunteers,
still clad in civilian tweed, or a little later in postman’s serge, of
which I9I5 yielded a strange surplus, able to remind roadside
spectators, at times even themselves, that they were votaries of
the Great Sacrifice. Many divisions received sufficient rifles to
issue one to every man only within weeks of going to France in
the autumn of I9I5; and the equipments of the artillery, whose
management was a great deal more complicated, were even
slower to arrive. At least three divisions which were to attack
on July Ist, Igi6, came to the Western Front in a state of training
which must be described as quite deficient. The 30th, 32nd
and 34th Divisions (all belonging to the fourth ‘hundred
thousand’- K’ in the jargon of the period) had been raised
only in December I 9 I 4, been allotted the meagrest cadre of experienced
officers and N.C.O.s, had received their proper complement
of weapons as late as the autumn of I9I5 and yet were
all shipped overseas between November I9I5 and January
Igi6. The promise of tragedy which loomed about these bands
of uniformed innocents was further heightened by reason of
their narrowly territorial recruitment; what had been a consolation
for the pangs of parting from home - that they were all
Pals or Chums together from the same close network of little
city terraces or steep-stacked rows of miners’ cottages- threa-
<b>(p.223)</b>
tened home with a catastrophe of heartbreak the closer they
neared a real encounter with the enemy. Grave enough in the
case of the 3oth, with its three Liverpool or Manchester
brigades, the threat bore even more heavily on the 34th, containing not
only the so-called Tyneside Irish and Tyneside
Scottish Brigades - eight thousand young men all domiciled in
or around Newcastle-on-Tyne- but also a Pioneer battalion,
the I8th Northumberland Fusiliers, raised by the Newcastle
and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce from the shop assistants
of the city: the notion of a regiment of Kippses and Mr Pollys
fine-tunes the poignancy of the Pals idea. <br>
<br>
From this it might be thought that the composition of a
division not yet mentioned- the 36th-was potentially tragic;
It was the most close-knit of all the Kitchener formations its
Infantry having’ been raised wholly in Ulster (Ulster was ‘the
divisional subtitle). Its very existence, however, testified to the
extreme militancy, and living military tradition, of the Protestant
people from which it exclusively sprang. Half-Catholic
though the nine counties of Ulster were, there were no Catholics
in the 36th. Indeed its parent body- the Ulster Volunteer
Force- had been raised well before the outbreak of the war as
a weapon of Protestant opposition to the grant of Irish Horn~’
Rome’ -Rule; and its leaders’ offer to the British Government
of its most able-bodied members as soldiers had come as a
considerable relief to Westminster in the autumn of 19I4, when
the kingdom had seemed threatened by an Irish civil as well as
a foreign war. <br>
<br>
Completing the composition of the army which was to
attack on the Somme were a number of formations whose
foundation also antedated I9I4, though by much longer than
the U. V .F.’s. These were the Territorial Force divisions - the
46th North Midland, 48th South Midland, 49th West Riding
and 56th London- whose existence recalled an earlier mid-Victorian
craze for amateur soldiering, brought on by a’ panic
scare that Louis Napoleon’s nary threatened the impregnability
of the white cliffs and sustained by a simple bourgeois pleasure
in the wearing of uniforms and the bandying-about of military
titles. These Volunteers (the Ulstermen had pinched their
emotive title) had eventually become an accepted, if slightly
comic feature of the Victorian social fabric- accepted by the
<b>(p.224)</b>
respectable classes in a way the regulars were not, because they
aspired after the military virtues without indulging in the
military vices, found comical because their aspirations generally
fell a little short of the mark. Some of the Territorial battalions,
however, particularly the London ones, had latterly become
very good, drawing on a stock of well-educated, games-playing
young men to supply their ranks; Conan Doyle has Sherlock
Holmes characterize a stockbroker’s clerk who appears in one
of his cases as ‘representative of the type found in one of our
better London Volunteer regiments’, probably meaning the
London Rifle Brigade or Queen Victoria’s Rifles, both in 1916
forming part of the 56th Division which would attack at
Gommecourt. And after the reorganization of 1908, even the
more rustic Volunteer units had been brought to a standard of
training nearer that of the regulars. At that date, indeed, and
on swapping their title of Volunteers for that of Territorials,
they had lost their old battalion numbers and been hitched on
to the series of the regular county regiments. In consequence, a
roll-call of battalions in the 46th (North Midland) Division, to
take one example, made it sound like a segment of the regular
army: it contained the 5th and 6th Battalions, South Staffordshire
Regiment, 5th and 6th North Staffordshires, 4th and 5th
Lincolns, 4th and 5th Leicesters, and 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th
Sherwood Foresters (the Nottinghamshire ~nd Derbyshire
Regiment). But in human terms, each of these battalions represented
a voluntary, part-time, peace-time effort at soldiering by
the menfolk of one or another midland town, rural or industrial:
Walsall, Wolverhampton, Burton, Hanley, Leicester, Loughborough,
‘Lincoln, Grimsby, Newark, Nottingham, Derby,
Chesterfield; and in practice their domestication was even more
intimate, many of them having their component companies
located in a suburb or outlying township, where the drill hall
was as much part of the fabric as the nonconformist chapel and
run almost as soberly- and some having platoons centred
on a single village. The same went for the artillery, engineers
and services of the division, the 46th having its batteries at
Louth, Boston, the Lincolnshire market town, Stoke-on-Trent
(Arnold Bennett country), West Bromwich, one of Birmingham’s
drearier appendages, and Leek (whether Winston Churchill
had not, trade union legend to the contrary, sent troops to
<b>(p.225)</b>
cow the miners in 1910). Its engineer field companies were located
at Smethwick, another charmless outlier of Birmingham,
and Cannock, a tiny country town, overwhelmed by its surrounding
coalmines, on the edge of the magnificent countryside
of the Chase. <br>
<br>
In a more diffuse and traditional manner than the Kitchener
divisions, therefore, those of the Territorial Force were a military
embodiment of the regions from which they hailed. By the
summer of 1916, however, many of their originals were invalided
or dead. For, following the destruction of the regular
Expeditionary Force in the 1914 battles, it was the Territorials
who, arriving in France in early 1915, had held the line until
Kitchener’s men could arrive. By the spring of 1916 a regular
battalion like the 2nd Royal Welch Fusiliers (that extraordinary
battalion of poets, wartime home both of Siegfried Sassoon
and Robert Graves) still had left about 250 of the men who had
accompanied it to France eighteen months before, demonstrating
a drain of about ten soldiers a week- sometimes more,
of course, sometimes less. The Territorials, though ‘out’ less
long, had suffered a similar total loss, for they had started with
weaker battalions and had had to detach men as cadres to their
‘second line’, on which new battalions were formed. In almost
no battalion among those earmarked to attack on July Ist,
therefore, had more than a quarter of the men, of whatever
rank, memories of peacetime soldiering. Some of the regulars,
by pulling in their Reservists and Special Reservists, could still
field an almost complete turn-out of long service men. But
among the remainder there was only a very little to choose, in
terms of collective military experience, between the first and
last joined.
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> The Tactics</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Awareness of this lack of experience was strong at General and
Fourth Army Headquarters, where the staffs had, in consequence,
framed plans of stark simplicity for the infantry. The
Fourth Army’s eleven front-line divisions, of which six had
not previously been in battle, were, on the cessation of the<br>
<br>
artillery preparation, and following behind its barrage fire, to
leave their trenches and walk forward, on a front of about
fifteen miles, for a mile and a half. In the centre of the front,
a walk of a little less than that distance would give them
possession of the German second line of entrenchments; on the
northern sector, the walk to the German second position was a
good two miles; on the southern sector, the German second
position was judged to be too far back for it to be taken in a
single day and the objectives were accordingly set somewhat
closer. Next to the British on the southern sector a French force,
of which the insatiable demands of the Verdun battle progressively
reduced the size until on July 1st it numbered thirteen
divisions, was to attack up both banks of the River Somme,
behind a great weight of artillery. French small-unit tactics,
perfected painfully over two years of warfare, laid emphasis on
the advance of small groups by rushes, one meanwhile supporting
another by fire -the sort of tactics which were to become
commonplace in the Second World War. This sophistication of
traditional ‘fire and movement’ was known to the British but
was thought by the staff to be too difficult to be taught to the
Kitchener divisions. They may well have been right. But the
alternative tactical order they laid down for them was oversimplified:
divisions were to attack on fronts of about a mile,
generally with two brigades ‘up’ and one in reserve. What this
meant, in terms of soldiers on the ground, was that two battalions
each of a thousand men, forming the leading wave of the
brigade, would leave their front trenches, using scaling-ladders
to climb the parapet, extend their soldiers in four lines, a company
to each, the men two or three yards apart, the lines about
fifty to a hundred yards behind each other, and advance to the
German wire. This they would expect to find flat, or at least
widely gapped, and, passing through, they would then jump
down into the German trenches, shoot, bomb or bayonet any
who opposed them, and take possession. Later the reserve
waves would pass through and advance to capture the German
second position by similar methods. <br>
<br>
The manœuvre was to be done slowly and deliberately, for
the men were to be laden with about sixty pounds of equipment,
their re-supply with food and ammunition during the
battle being one of the things the staff could not guarantee. In
<b>(p.227)</b>
the circumstances, it did indeed seem that success would depend
upon what the artillery could do for the infantry, both before
the advance began and once it was under way.
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> The Bombardment</i></b></center><br>
<br>
The artillery fire plan was as elaborate as the infantry tactical
scheme was simple. Artillery now comprised a great variety of
weapons, firing several different sorts of ammunition: field
artillery, the lightest and most plentiful variety, composed of
18-pounder guns and 4·5-inch howitzers, which fired small
shrapnel or high explosive or (more rarely) gas shells out to a
range of about six thousand yards; medium artillery- 6opounder
and 4· 7- inch or 6-inch guns which fired high explosive
shells out to ten thousand yards; and a variety of heavy howitzers,
6-, 8-, 9.2-, 12- and I5-inch calibre which dropped 100- to
1400-pound shells from a high angle at ranges between five and
eleven thousand yards. In addition, the infantry brigades controlled
their own ‘trench mortars’, simple smooth-bore tubes
which lobbed 2-inch, s-inch or 4-inch bombs in a very steep
trajectory from one trench to another across no-man’s-land. <br>
<br>
Range, weight of shell and trajectory determined what the
different tasks of these weapons should be. Trench mortars,
having the shortest range and firing a projectile without any
penetrative power, were turned against nearby surface targets,
the enemy’s trenches, which they were intended to collapse,
and his wire, which they were expected to help cut. Wire-cutting
was indeed the most fundamental of the artillery’s
duties, for should the German entanglements remain intact on
the morning of Z-Day (the day of the attack), the infantry
advance would terminate on the far side of no-man’s-land. The
belts were very thick. Accordingly, the 18-pounders of the
divisional field artilleries were also assigned almost exclusively
to wire-cutting-though their fire, with the shrapnel shell of the
period and its slow-acting fuse, tended to waste itself in the
ground under the entanglements (instead of bursting on ‘graze’
against the wire). Some of the 18-pounders’ fire was also allocated,
however, to ‘counter-battery’- firing, that is, at the
<b>(p.228)</b>
estimated positions of the enemy’s guns, in the hope of knocking
them out before the infantry had to advance through the
barrage which those could put down on to the British parapet
and into no-man’s-land. What little gas shell was available was
to be chiefly reserved for last-minute counter-battery fire, the
British artillerymen understanding how difficult their German
opposite numbers would find it to work guns while wearing
gas-masks. <br>
<br>
Howitzers and the heavier guns had the task of material
destruction- of communication trenches, approach roads, railway
spurs, of anything which aided the movement of men and
supplies into the trenches which were to be attacked, but above
all of strongpoints and machine-gun posts. These were of different
sorts. In several places, notably where the German front
crossed the site of a former village, the defenses were notably
stronger than in the open fields between. For although the
Germans had excavated thirty-foot-deep dug-outs at regular
intervals all along their front, which were proof against a direct
hit by any weight of shell, and had thus assured that their trench
garrisons would be alive even at the end of a prolonged British
bombardment, these ‘field’ positions could not be given, without
enormous extra labour, the complex illogicality presented
to an attacker by the ruin of an inhabited area. In some spots,
like the Leipzig salient between the devastated villages of
Thiepval and Pozieres, sporadic local attack and counterattack
had produced a maze of trenches as impenetrable as any
ruin; and elsewhere, as at the Schwaben Redoubt, the Germans
had thought it worth devoting the necessary spadework to
building an artificial fortress-entrenchment. But the villages
were the most important revetments of the German line; and
the most important ingredient in the Germans’ scheme of
defence for these strongpoints was the fire of machine-guns. It
was to the destruction of their emplacements, or the entombment
of their crews in their positions of shelter, that the British
heavy artillery was to devote its bombardment during the six
days of ‘preparation’. <br>
<br>
The machine-gun was to be described by Major-General
J. F. C. Fuller, one of the great enrages of military theory produced
by the war, as ‘concentrated essence of infantry’, by
which he meant his readers to grasp that its invention put into
<b>(p.229)</b>
the hands of one man the fire-power formerly wielded by forty.
Given that a good rifleman could fire only fifteen shots a minute
to a machine-gunner’s six hundred, the point is well made. But,
as Fuller would no doubt have conceded if taxed a machine~
n team did not simply represent the equivalent of so many
Infantrymen compressed into a small compass. Infantrymen,
however well-trained and well-armed, however resolute, however
ready to kill, remain erratic agents of death. Unless centrally
directed, they will choose, perhaps badly, their own
targets will open and cease fire individually, will be put off
their aim by the enemy’s return of fire, will be distracted by
the wounding of those near them, will yield to fear or excitement,
will fire high, low or wide. It was to overcome influences
and tendencies of this sort- as well as to avert the danger of
accident in closely packed ranks- that seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century armies had put such effort into perfecting
volley fire by square, line and column. The result was to make
an early-nineteenth-century-Waterloo-infantry regiment arguably
more dangerous to approach than a late-nineteenth century-
Boer War-one. For though the latter had better
weapons than the former, and ones which fired to a much
greater range, these technical advantages were, if not cancelled
out, certainly much offset by the dispersion of the soldiers which
the very improvement of firearms itself enjoined- dispersion
meaning lack of control, which in its turn results in poor
musketry. Hence the wonder with which the machine-gun was
viewed with when Maxim first made it a practicable weapon of war.
For it appeared to have put back into the hands of the regimental
commander the means to inflict multiple and simultaneous
wounding by the giving of a single word of command.
But the appearance of the machine-gun was, of course, very
much more than a reversion to a former order of things. For the
most important thing about a machine-gun is that it is a
machine, and one of quite an advanced type, similar in some
respects to a high-precision lathe, in others to an automatic
press. Like a lathe, it requires to be set up so that it will
operate within desired and predetermined limits; this was done
on the Maxim gun, common to all armies of 1914-18, by
adjusting the angle of the barrel relative to its fixed firing
platform, and tightening or loosening its traversing screw. Then,
<b>(p.230)</b>
like an automatic press, it would, when actuated by a simple
trigger, begin and continue to perform its functions with the
minimum of human attention, supplying its own power and
only requiring a steady supply of raw material and a little
routine maintenance to operate efficiently throughout a working
shift. The machine-gunner is best thought of, in short, as a
sort of machine-minder, whose principal task was to feed ammunition
belts into the breech, something which could be done
while the gun was in full operation, top up the fluid in the
cooling jacket, and traverse the gun from left to right and back
again within the limits set by its firing platform. Traversing
was achieved by a technique known, in the British army, as the
‘two inch tap’ : by constant practice, the machine-gunner
learned to hit the side of the breech with the palm of his hand
just hard enough to move the muzzle exactly two inches against
the resistance of the traversing screw. A succession of ‘two inch
taps’ first on one side of the breech until the stop was reached,
then on the other, would keep in the air a stream of bullets so
dense that no one could walk upright across the front of the
machine-gunner’s position without being hit- given, of course,
that the gunner had set his machine to fire low and that the
ground was devoid of cover. The appearance of the machinegun,
therefore, had not so much disciplined the act of killing which
was what seventeenth-century drill had done- as
mechanized or industrialized it. <br>
<br>
It was this automatic and inhuman lethality of the machinegun
which determined that the posts from which it would
operate must be the principal target of the heavy artillery
between June 25th and 30th. Unfortunately for the British
infantry, the heavy howitzer of 1916 was a piece of technology
very much less developed towards perfection, relative to its
potential, than was the machine-gun. The desirable characteristics
of the machine-gun, besides those of functional efficiency,
were portability, concealability and compactness. The Maxim
met the first fairly, the other two very well. The desirable
characteristics of the heavy howitzer were pin-point precision
and intense concussive effect. These neither the 6-,8- or 9.2-inch
howitzer achieved (the larger calibres were too few in number
to matter). Their shells had an aiming error of at least twenty-five
yards and an explosive power insufficient to collapse the
<b>(p.231)</b>
very deep dug-outs- ‘mined’ dug-outs, the British called them,
for they were driven by mining technique thirty feet below the
surface- in which the machine-gunners sheltered, with their
weapons, during a bombardment. Thus the British could not
destroy the kernel of a German strongpoint. The best they
could hope to do was to trap the crews below ground by choking
the entrance shaft with spoil from the collapsed trench; but to
hit the shaft, unless by luck, required either an altogether more
revealing sort of air photograph than the Royal Flying Corps’
cameras could supply or else constant, life-wasting raiding
across no-man’s-land to locate precisely where the dug-out
entrances lay. <br>
<br>
If we look, then, at the preliminaries to the attack of July 1st
as a struggle between competing technologies, between the
manifest power of the British artillery and the latent power of
the German machine-guns, it will be seen clearly as a struggle
the British waged on unequal terms- and terms which they
failed to reverse, despite achieving the appearance of terrible
devastation. The bombardment opened on June 24th. It was
intended to last five days, but a postponement of Z-Day extended
it to seven. Over the period, about 1,800,000 shells from
the stocks which had been dumped were fired – 138000 on
June 24th, 375,000 on June 30th. Much the greater number about
a million-were 18-pounder shrapnel shells; the 6-inch
howitzers fired about 80,000, the 8- and 9.2-inch about 80,000
each. These are impressive totals. To achieve them the artillery
crews had to labour, humping shells or heaving to re-align their
ponderous weapons (the 8-inch howitzer weighed thirteen
tons), hour after hour throughout the day and for long periods
of the night. At the receiving end, the noise, shock-waves and
destructive effect were extremely unpleasant. At first the Germans
in the trenches opposite thought the bombardment
heralded an attack and stood to arms in their dug-outs. Then,
as the shelling continued, waxing and waning in strength, they
realized that they were in for a long ordeal and settled down to
bear it as best they could.
<br>
<blockquote> During June 25 ... the fire of the British ... batteries increased,
and whereas on the previous day nine-tenths of
the fire had been shrapnel or from guns of small caliber </blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.232)</b>
<blockquote> [shrapnel was disregarded because its scatter of mankilling
pellets was of very little effect against entrenchments],
the heavy batteries seemed now in the majority.
Their shells crashed into the German trenches, the ground
shook and the dug-outs tottered. Here and there the sides
of a trench fell in, completely blocking it. Masses of earth
came tumbling into the deep dug-outs, obstructing all
entrances [which of course faced away from the direction
of the shelling] to many of them. By evening some sectors
of the German front-line were already unrecognizable and
had become crater-fields.* </blockquote><br>
<br>
The British next began to mix gas with their shelling, using
primitive projectors and the prevailing wind-stream to carry it
across no-man’s-land. <br>
<br>
<blockquote>In the early hours [of June 26] clouds of chlorine gas ...
reached the German position [near Fricourt] and, being
heavier than air, filled every crevice in the ground. The
dense fumes crept like live things down the steps of the
deep dug-outs, filling them with poison until sprayers
negatived their effect . . . during the afternoon aerial torpedoes,
fired from heavy mortars in the British front-line,
made their first appearance. Coming down almost perpendicularly
from a great height, these monsters bored deep
into the ground and then burst. [This reference is almost
certainly not to mortar bombs but to the shells of the
super-heavy howitzer, fortunately for the Germans very
few in number.] Tons of earth and great blocks of chalk
and rock were hurled into the air, leaving craters, some
twelve feet deep and fifteen feet in diameter. Only deep
dug-outs of great strength could stand the shock . . . The
Germans, who up till now had endured the inferno almost
with indifference, began to feel alarmed. Every nerve
was strained as they sat listening to the devilish noise and
waited for the dull thud of the next torpedo as it buried itself
in the ground, and then the devastating explosion. [The
similar experience of listening to the Krupp 420mm
siege-howitzers ‘walking’ their shells up to the target had
driven men hysterical inside the Liege forts in August, </blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.231)</b>
<br>
<blockquote>1914.] The concussion put out the candles and acetylene
lights in the deepest dug-outs. The walls rocked like the
sides of a ship and the darkness was filled with smoke and
gas fumes ... The 27th and 28th June brought a similar
picture of continuous devastation ... The bombardment continued
to appear without method, an intense and apparently
wild shelling, then carefully observed heavy artillery
fire by individual batteries, then trench-mortar bombs
and aerial torpedoes or gas attacks, or again a sudden
tornado of shells, with occasional periods of complete
quiet. <br>
<br>
June 30th was a repetition of the previous six days. The
German front defences no longer existed as such ... [But] in
spite of the devastation and chaos on the surface, the defenders
in those of the deep dug-outs still intact (the
majority) had ... survived the ordeal. For seven days and
nights they had sat on the long wooden benches or on the
wire beds in the evil-smelling dug-outs some twenty feet
and more below ground. The incessant noise and the need
for constant watchfulness had allowed them little sleep,
and ever-present, too, had been the fear that their dug-outs
might at any time become a living tomb from which escape
would be impossible. Warm food had seldom reached
them ... so that they had had to live on [iron rations]. </blockquote>
<br>
But they were alive.
<blockquote>At 6.00 a.m., however, [onJuly 1st] a bombardment of an
intensity as yet unparalleled suddenly burst out again
along the whole front. At first it was most severe in the
centre, about Thiepval and Beaumont, but it spread
quickly over the entire line from north of the Ancre to
south of the Somme. For the next hour continuous lines of
great fountains of earth, rocks, smoke and debris, played
constantly into the air . . . The giant explosions of the
heaviest shells were the only distinguishable noises in the
continuous thunder of the bombardment and short, regular
intervals of their bursts gave it certain rhythm. All trace
of the front-trench system was now lost, and, with only a
few exceptions, all the telephone cables connecting it with
the rear lines and batteries were destroyed, in spite of the</blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.234)</b>
<blockquote>six feet of depth at which they had been laid. Through the
long periscopes held up out of the dug-outs could be seen a
mass of steel helmets above the British parapet ... The Germans
in their dug-outs, each with a beltful of handgrenades,
therefore waited ready, rifle in hand, for the
bombardment to lift from the front trench to the rear
defences. It was of vital importance not to lose a second in
reaching the open before the British infantry could arrive
at the dug-out entrances. </blockquote>
<br>
The battle was about to begin. And its first, and indeed decisive
act was to be the ‘race for the parapet’ -a race which for
the British ran from their own front trench to the other side of
no-man’s-land, for the Germans from the bottom to the top of
their dug-out steps. Whoever first arrived at the German parapet
would live. The side which lost the race would die, either
bombed in the recesses of the earth or shot on the surface in
front of the trench. Every British effort had been directed to
ensuring that the Germans lost the race -that they would
indeed lack the runners to make it a contest. But, as we have
seen, the majority of the German trench garrisons still lived at
zero hour on Z-Day. How had the British artillery effort been
expended to such little purpose? <br>
<br>
The greater part of the answer is revealed by isolating the
proportion of active ingredient in the British bombardment;
that is, of explosive delivered to the German-occupied area.
The weight of shells transported to the British guns was about
21,000 tons, excluding propellant (the explosive needed to
drive the shell up the barrel at the moment of firing). It had
taken the efforts of about fifty thousand gunners (almost the
number of Wellington’s army at Waterloo), working for seven
days, to load this weight into their pieces and fire it at the
enemy- or, more precisely, into the area, 25,000 by 2,000 yards
square, which the British infantry were to attack. In crude
terms, this meant that each 2,500 square yards had received a
ton of shells; or, if numbers of shells are used for the calculation-
and about I ,500,000, had been fired- that each 1,000
square yards had received 30 shells. However, about a million
of the shells were shrapnel, fired by the IS-pounder field guns
of the divisional artilleries, and these could do very little
<b>(p.235)</b>
damage to earthworks, since they were filled only with light
steel balls, and only a little more to wire, though it was their
alleged wire-cutting capability which justified the firing of the
enormous number used. In fact, the IS-pounders were set to
firing shrapnel because the ammunition factories in England
could not yet produce high-explosive shell for them in any
quantity, though almost everyone in the B.E.F. from G.H.Q.
officer to simple gunner had now come to realize that it was
high explosive alone which did serious damage to an entrenched
enemy. <br>
<br>
Discounting the shrapnel, therefore, we are left with the
output of the howitzers and heavy guns- about half a million
shells of 12,000 tons weight. The lightest and most plentifully
expended shell was that of the 4.5-inch field howitzers of the
divisional artilleries, which weighed 35 pounds; the heaviest,
that of the I 5-inch howitzers, which weighed I ,400 pounds but
of which there was a strictly limited ration, there being only
six of these monster guns on the battlefield. Nevertheless, their
contribution to the bombardment- about I ,500 shells, weighing
a thousand tons - is impressive, and all the more so if we recall
that Napoleon had with him at Waterloo only about a hundred
tons of artillery projectile in all. Comparisons between the
artillery efforts of ISI5 and Igi6 are pointless, however, for
Napoleon’s gunners had had the fairly simple task of firing solid
shot from close range at dense and immobile masses of soldiers
upon whom a hit meant a kill; Haig’s gunners, by contrast,
could not see their target and could not be sure that, even if they
hit it, their fire would have a lethal effect. That this should be
so was due to the very small proportion of explosive contained
within the casing of the shell. The I ,400-pound shell of the
I 5-inch howitzer, for example, contained 200 pounds of explosive
(Ammatol, a mixture of TNT and Ammonium Nitrate);
the 35-pound shell of the 4.5-inch howitzer contained only four
pounds ten ounces: The explanation of this disparity between
total weight of shell and weight of filling was twofold: the
stresses to which the shell was subjected during firing required
that it have a very strong, and therefore heavy, casing, if it
were not to disintegrate inside the gun with disastrous effect;
while the purpose of the shell, as conceived by its designers, was
to produce a large number of steel splinters, travelling at
<b>(p.236)</b>
man-killing speed, as a by-blow of its explosion. For that reason,
most shells were fused to explode on impact, their detonation
producing those enormous fountains of earth and smoke which
are the staple feature of First World War battlescapes. <br>
<br>
It is these fountains which give the game away. Out of the
12,000 tons weight of shell delivered on to the German-occupied
area, only about nine hundred tons represented high-explosive.
And the greater part of that small explosive load was dissipated
in the air, flinging upwards, to be sure, a visually impressive
mass of surface material and an aurally terrifying
shower of steel splinters, but a proportionately
quite trifling concussion downwards towards the hiding places
of the German trench garrisons. Each ten square yards had
received only a pound of high-explosive, or each square mile
about thirty tons. Twenty-eight years later, the Allied air forces
would put down on German positions in Normandy, and in
minutes not days, something like eight hundred tons of bombs
to the square mile, most of that tonnage consisting of high explosive,
for free-falling bombs, being unsubjected to stress,
can be given the thinnest and lightest of cases. Today, NATO
tactical doctrine would regard the Somme position as a suitable
target for several small nuclear warheads, each of which would
yield many thousand tons of TNT equivalent to the square
mile. But some of the defenders, if properly dug in under overhead
cover, would still be expected to survive-as many German
soldiers who cowered under the aerial preparation for Operations
Goodwood and Cobra in July 1944 survived to man their
weapons against the British and American tank columns which
emerged through the dust of the bombing. <br>
<br>
We can see now, therefore, that the great Somme bombardment,
for all its sound and fury, was inadequate to the task
those who planned it expected of it. The shells which the British
guns had fired at the German trenches, like those which a
month earlier had broken up on the armoured skins of the
German battleships at Jutland, were the wrong sort of projectile
for the job, and often badly made. And while the British naval
gunners had been able to see, and knew how to hit, their
targets, the British field and garrison gunners, many of them
amateurs, had largely to guess at where their real targets, the
German machine-gun crews, were hidden, and then very
<b>(p.237)</b>
often lacked the skill to put a shell where they wanted it
to fall. Hence, despite the precision of the fire plan, that
haphazard cratering of the battlefield, sometimes on, sometimes
beyond, sometimes short of the German trench line and
wire entanglements, which all observers of the Somme front
mention.
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> The Final Preliminaries</i></b></center><br>
<br>
The infantry, fortunately, remained largely unaware of the
random and unsatisfactory result of the shelling which had
filled their ears with sound for the last week, during every hour
of the day and many of the nights. There was a good deal of
individual apprehension. ‘It was the Division’s first battle’,
wrote the historian of the 18th, ‘and the solemnity of the
occasion affected everyone.’ Private Gilbert Hall, of the 1st
Barnsley Pals (13th York and Lanes) was not feeling quite himself
and had got a headache from the bombardment. Capt.
E. C. T. Minet, machine-gun officer of the 1 I1th Royal Fusiliers,
felt himself ‘sweating at zero hour. But that, I suppose, was
nervous excitement.’ Private Frank Hawkings, of Queen Victoria’s
Rifles, had found that since June 29th ‘the suspense
very trying and everyone ... very restless.’ But the long notice
of the battle which everyone who was to be in it had been
given- a new development in warfare and a function of the
complex preparation which battles of the industrial age require-
had allowed men the chance to make what personal
accommodation with their fears they could. Most had written
home, made out their wills, shaken hands with their pals. Many
had gone to church. Each battalion of the B.E.F., the army of
a church-going age and nation, had its own chaplain of the
appropriate denoinination, and they had held services behind
the lines a day or two beforehand. Second-Lieutenant John
Engall, of the 16th London Regiment, wrote home ‘the day
before the most important of my life . . . I took my Communion
yesterday with dozens of others who are going over
tomorrow and never have I attended a more impressive service.
I placed my body in God’s keeping and I am going into battle
<b>(p.238)</b>
with His name on my lips, full of confidence and trusting implicitly
in Him.’ Like so many other subalterns of the London
division, Engall was to die outside Gommecourt. His explicit
piety, which would have jarred with most of Wellington’s
ensigns, came as naturally to him as to them their stylish indifference.
But it would not necessarily have surprised them;
the attendance at (Anglican) Communion of ‘the dozens of
others’ -private soldiers of his regiment- most certainly would
have done. The religiosity of their private soldiers was part and
parcel of an altogether rougher persona than even the most
hardened old-sweat regiments of 1914 could show. <br>
<br>
It was a help, too, in calming fears that the last hours before
zero were filled for most infantry soldiers with a carefully timetabled
programme of activity. The attacking battalions, which
were out of the line, had to march up to the trenches from the
villages where they had been billeted, first along the roads,
then in the communication trenches which covered the last
mile. On the way the men accumulated a growing load of kit.
Starting with two hundred rounds of ammunition and two
days’ rations, they successively picked up new empty sandbags
(to fortify the positions they were to take), a wiring stake (for
the same purpose), grenades, shovels, rockets and sometimes
pigeon baskets, the two last items to help their officers communicate
with the rear once they had passed beyond cablehead
in the front trench. All this took a great deal of time, and the
columns had also to press forward against a flow of men coming
down the trenches from the battalions which were being
relieved. When they arrived at their jumping-off places, the
men were glad to huddle under a blanket or greatcoat on the
floor of the trench and sleep. <br>
<br>
Most awoke early, to find a light rain falling through white
morning mist. In places it lingered even after the bombardment
had struck up at 6.25 a.m. for the regular morning session, so
that Lieutenant Chetwynd-Stapleton, on air patrol above the
front, saw ‘a bank of low cloud’ on which ‘one could see ripples
... from the terrific bombardment that was taking place below.
It looked like a large lake of mist, with thousands of stones being
thrown into it.’ Across the greater breadth of the front, however,
the mist quickly cleared, giving way to bright sunshine
from a brilliant cloudless sky. Into it little plumes of smoke rose
<b>(p.239)</b>
here and there from the British front where men were furtively
cooking breakfast. Orders were for soldiers to be fed with food
sent from the rear, and in the best organized battalions it
arrived, prompt and hot. Lieutenant-Colonel Crozier, commanding
the 9th Royal Irish Rifles (the West Belfast Battalion
of the Ulster Volunteer Force), congratulated his cook-sergeant
on having bacon rashers, fried bread, jam and tea ready for
his riflemen, and a mixture of cold tea and lemon to go into
their water-bottles for the trip across no-man’s-land. Officers
were being brought hot water in which to shave, and were
tidying their uniforms, still conspicuously different from the
soldiers’, unless they belonged to battalions in which it was not
thought bad form to don rough Tommy serge. Major Jack,
commanding a company of the 2nd Cameronians, put on his
silver spurs for the occasion, and his soldier servant gave him ‘a
final brush’. Few, if any, were to wear swords (though even
temporary officers were still buying swords on commissioning)
but all carried sticks, polished blackthorn with a silver band in
the Irish regiments, malacca canes or ashplants with a curved
handle, of the sort sold by seaside tobacconists, in others. Some
carried nothing else, not even a revolver, thinking it an officer’s
role to lead and direct, not to kill- the need for which, in any
case, they believed woul~ have been nullified by the bombardment.<br>
<br>
Between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m., the noise of the bombardment
reached a level not yet touched, as weapons of every calibre
and sort put down their final ration of shells on the German
front trenches. Hawkings, of Queen Victoria’s Rifles, had been
watching a lark climb into the sky opposite Gommecourt, when
the artillery, which had hitherto been firing spasmodically,
<br><blockquote>
suddenly blazed out in one colossal roar. The dull booms
of the heavy guns in the rear could just be discerned amidst
the sharper and incessant cracks of the 1 8-pounders and
4· 7s that were closer to the line. There seemed to be a
continual stream of shells rumbling and whining overhead
on their way to the enemy positions, where the succession
of explosions added to the general noise. Fifteen-inch
howitzer and 9.2 shells were falling in Gommecourt Wood,
whole trees were uprooted and flung into the air, and</blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.241)</b>
<br>
<blockquote> eventually the wood was in flames. The landscape seemed
to be blotted out by drifting smoke; but as part of our
scheme was to set up a smoke screen we commenced
throwing out smoke bombs. </blockquote>
<br>
Under the weight of this cannonade, the Germans crouched
invisible in their dug-outs, waiting for the moment it should
lift as the signal to race up exit shafts. Meanwhile the soldiers
of the I st Somerset Light Infantry sat on the parapet of their
trench opposite, laughing and cheering at the sight of the
detonations. <br>
<br>
Some other soldiers were also already out of their trenches,
where the last thing almost everyone had received was a strong
tot of rum-Navy rum, and extremely alcoholic. In the 11th
Suffolks, two men who had got the teetotallers’ share drank
themselves insensible and could not be got on to their feet
again; and J. F. C. Fuller, investigating a confusion in the
Sherwood Forester Brigade, was told that the whole of the leading
wave was drunk. He thought the story an exaggeration which
it almost certainly was- but, knowing that ‘in many
cases men deliberately avoided eating before a battle, for fear
of being shot through a full stomach’ and discovering that
‘through some error’ the first line got the rwn ration intended
for the second as well as their own, he concluded that ‘many of
the men in the front line must have been drunk well before
zero hour.’ A strong tot of rum, whatever its functional effect,
must have been particularly comforting to the men in those
divisions whose commanders had decided to take them out of
the trench to lie down in no-man’s-land before zero- the 8th,
36th, 46th and s6th and part of the 32nd. <br>
<br>
The signal for these men to stand up and advance, for those
in the trenches to climb their scaling ladders and leap over the
parapet into no-man’s-land, was to be the shrill of the platoon
officers’ whistles, blown when their synchronized watches
showed 7.30 a.m. In four places, however-Mametz on the 7th
Division’s front, Fricourt (21st Division), La Boiselle (34th
Division), and Beawnont Hamel (29th Division) -the signal,
about ten minutes ahead of zero, was to be the detonation of
eight enormous mines which had been tunnelled under the
German trenches and filled with dynamite.

<center><b><i> The Battle</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Despite the immense growth of complexity of the machinery
and business of war which had taken place m Western armies
since I 8 I 5, the Battle of the Somme was to be in many ways a
simpler event than Waterloo- not, indeed, in terms of the
strains of management it threw on commanders and their
staffs, but in the range and nature of the encounters between
different categories of armed groups which took place on the
ground. At Waterloo we counted seven different sorts of encounters:
artillery versus artillery, infantry and cavalry,
cavalry versus cavalry and infantry; infantry versus infantry;
and single combat. Several of these could or did not occur on
the Somme. The horse, for example, had disappeared from the
battlefield, though to the regret of almost every soldier - even
infantry officers speak lovingly of their horses- and temporary
work in the transport section of infantry regiments was eagerly
sought after by the men, who seemed to find in caring for animals
an outlet for the gentler emotions to which they could give
no expression among their fellows. Haig had had three cavalry
divisions brought up to the Somme front, but they were neither
expected to, nor did they, play any part on July 1st, or any
other day in 19I6. Single combat, too, had ceased to be an
option, for soldiers on a bullet-lashed battlefield could neither
assume the posture nor risk the exposure-time necessary for the
exchange of blows, even if haphazard encounter brought them
together. The nearest thing to single combat in trench warfare
(‘him or me’ bayonet thrusting excepted), was perhaps the game
of ‘bombing up the traverses’, of which the most striking feature,
so characteristic of the First World War, was that one d1d not
see one’s enemy. Thus there were only three sorts of encounter
possible on the field of the Somme: artillery versus artillery;
artillery versus infantry; and infantry versus infantry- though,
if we treat machine-gunners as a separate category, we also
get infantry versus machine-gunners and artillery versus
machine-gunners. <br>
<br>
 We have already seen how much or little success artillery
had had in attacking infantry and machine-gunners, and in
<b>(p.243)</b>
attacking other artillery. Many of the German batteries had
had guns disabled and crews killed during the preliminary
bombardment. But enough remained to put down spoiling
bombardments on the British front trenches at the moment of
the attack- a company of the Queen Victoria’s Rifles, crowded
into their assembly trenches, were struck by a sudden stream
of shells at about 7 a.m. and had forty men killed or wounded
in a few minutes- and to fire standing barrages into no-mans’land
the instant they got the signal that the British had left
their trenches. These sorts of encounter apart, how did the
infantry fare, on both sides, once the British had left their
trenches to advance to the assault?
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> Infantary versus Machine-gunners</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Several survivors have left accounts of the first moments of the
attack. Queen Victoria’s Rifles, a leading battalion of 56th
London Division in VII Corps’ diversionary attack on the
northern flank of Fourth Army, had about five hundred yards
of no-man’s-land to cross; Royal Engineer companies laid
smoke from dischargers to cover their advance. Some time after
seven o’clock, the Germans ‘began spraying our parapets with
machine-gun bullets, but sharp to the minute of zero’ (7.25 a.m.
for this division) ‘we erected our ladders and climbed out into
the open. Shells were bursting everywhere and through the
drifting smoke in front of us we could see the enemy’s first line
from which grey figures emerged ... We moved forward in long
lines, stumbling through the mass of shell-holes, wire and
wreckage, and behind us more waves appeared.’ Towards the
centre of the Fourth Army’s front, the 9th Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers, of the 36th Ulster Division, were in the leading wave.
Their commanding officer, Ricardo,
<br>
<blockquote> 
stood on the parapet between the two centre exits to wish
them luck ... They got going without delay, no fuss, no
running, no shouting, everything solid and thorough-just
like the men themselves [these were farming people from
County Tyrone]. Here and there a boy would wave his</blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.243)</b>
<br>
<blockquote> 
hand to me as I shouted good luck ... through my megaphone.
And all had a cheery face. Most were carrying
loads. Fancy advancing against heavy fire with a big roll
of barbed wire on your shoulder! </blockquote>
<br>
Describing a second wave attack, in an account which holds
good for the first, Gilbert Hall of the 1st Barnsley Pals (13th
York and Lancasters, 31st Division), heard his officer blow his
whistle ‘and C Company climbed over the parapet and moved
forward to be confronted with ... a long grassy slope rising gently
to a series of low crests about six hundred yards in front. The
German trenches were clearly visible, three lines of fortifications
with sand-bagged parapets, enabled by the slope of the ground
to fire over each other into the advancing British infantry. In
front of the enemy lines lay thick belts of uncut wire, breached
by a few narrow gaps.’ Towards that wire the Barnsley
Pals set off, as up and down the line at zero did sixty thousand
other infantrymen. In some battalions, the men were able to
walk upright, with arms sloped or ported, as they had been
expecting. In others they were soon bent forward, like men
walking into a strong wind and rain, their bayonets fixed and
their rifles horizontal. ‘Troops always, in my experience’,
wrote Lord Chandos, whose observation this is, ‘unconsciously
assume this crouching position when advancing against heavy
fire.’<br>
<br>
 Most soldiers were encountering heavy fire within seconds of
leaving their trenches. The xoth West Yorks, attacking towards
the ruined village of Fricourt in the little valley of the River
Ancre, had its two follow-up companies caught in the open by
German machine-gunners who emerged from their dug-outs
after the leading waves had passed over the top and onward.
They were ‘practically annihilated and lay shot down in their
waves’. In the neighbouring 34th Division, the 15th and x6th
Royal Scots, two Edinburgh Pals’ Battalions containing a high
proportion of Mancunians, were caught in flank by machineguns
firing from the ruins of La Boiselle and lost several hundred
men in a few minutes, though the survivors marched on to
enter the German lines. Their neighbouring battalions, the
xoth Lincolns and I xth Suffolks (the Grimsby Chums and the
Cambridge Battalion) were caught by the same flanking fire;
<b>(p.245)</b>
of those who pressed on to the German trenches, some, to quote
the official history ‘were burnt to death by flame throwers as
[they] reached the [German] parapet’; others were caught again 
by machine-gun fire as they entered the German position.
An artillery officer who walked across later came on ‘line after
line of dead men lying where they had fallen’. Behind the
Edinburghs, the four Tyneside Irish battalions of the I 03rd
Brigade underwent a bizarre and pointless massacre. The 34th
Division’s commander had decided to move all twelve of his
battalions simultaneously towards the German front, the 101st
and 102nd Brigades from the front trench, the 103rd from the
support line (called the Tara-Usna Line, in a little re-entrant
known to the brigade as the Avoca V alley- all three names
allusions to Irish beauty spots celebrated by Y eats and the Irish
literary nationalists). This decision gave the last brigade a mile
of open ground to cover before it reached its own front line, a
safe enough passage if the enemy’s machine-guns had been
extinguished, otherwise a funeral march. A sergeant of the
3rd Tyneside Irish (26th Northumberland Fusiliers), describes
how it was: ‘I could see, away to my left and right, long lines of
men. Then I heard the “patter, patter” of machine-guns in the
distance. By the time I’d gone another ten yards there seemed
to be only a few men left around me; by the time I had gone
twenty yards, I seemed to be on my own. Then I was hit
myself.’ Not all went down so soon. A few heroic souls pressed
on to the British front line, crossed no-man’s-land and entered
the German trenches. But the brigade was destroyed; one of its
battalions had lost over six hundred men killed or wounded,
another, five hundred; the brigadier and two battalion commanders
had been hit, a third lay dead.* Militarily, the advance
had achieved nothing. Most of the bodies lay on territory
British before the battle had begun. <br>
<br>
In the neighbouring 32nd Division, the x6th Northumberland
Fusiliers (Newcastle Commercials) and the 15th Lancashire
Fusiliers (I st Salford Pals) were also hit by machine-gun fire
from Thiepval as they got out of their trenches, the Newcastle
Commercials following a football kicked by a well-known north
country player. Several waves were cut down at once and the

* In the Tyneside Scottish Brigade, all four battalion commanders were
killed on July 1st.
<b>(p.246)</b>
commanding officers ordered the untouched companies to stay
in their trenches. In the swampy valley of the Ancre, several
battalions of the Ulster Division were enfiladed by German
machine-guns as the men tried to cross no-man’s-land, there
four hundred yards wide. Casualties were worst in the 8th
Royal Irish Fusiliers (the Armagh, Monaghan and Cavan
battalion of the U.V.F.), 532 officers and men going down as
rush after rush towards the wire -orthodox tactics learnt on
Irish hillsides in make-believe battles four years before- was
stopped by bursts of bullets; losses in two others were almost as
heavy. In the regular 29th Division on the Ulstermen’s left,
several battalions suffered the worst of First World War experiences:
to advance across no-man’s-land under heavy fire
only to find the enemy’s wire uncut (it was uncut at many
places elsewhere also) and to be machine-gunned down while
searching for a way through. Among them were the 1st Royal
Inniskilling Fusiliers, the same Inniskillings who had stood in
square to be cannonaded throughout the afternoon near the
crossroads at Waterloo a hundred and one years before. Opposite
Beaumont Hamel, fired on by German machine-gunners
who had emerged from the recesses of Y Ravine, into which the
Division’s amateur gunners had tried but failed to drop a shell
during the bombardment, 868 Inniskillings became casualties
in a few minutes, of whom 246 died. Shortly afterwards the only
battalion from the Empire to take part in the Somme attack,
the 1st Newfoundland Regiment, raised exclusively from native born
Newfoundlanders, tried to find a way where the Inniskillings
had found none and in the attempt lost more men
killed, wounded or missing -710, including all the officers than
any other battalion was to do on July 1st (though the
1oth West Yorks had just lost exactly the same number opposite
Fricourt, on the 21st Division’s front). Finally, on the 46th
(North Midland) Division’s front, at the extreme northern edge
of the battlefield, the 1 {6th North Staffords and the I /6th
South Staffords, Territorial battalions from Wolverhampton
and Hanley, each had their leading companies caught by fire
opposite uncut wire, on which most who arrived there were
shot or bombed by the defenders.
<b>(p.247)</b>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> Infantry versus Infantry</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Perhaps twenty battalions of the attacking force, out of sixty
committed to the first wave, had thus been disabled in no-man’s land
by machine-gun fire, to which they had been unable to
reply and whose source they had generally been unable to
identify. A number had also suffered casualties from German
barrage fire - true barrage fire, in that it took the form of a
continuous fall of shells along a predetermined line in no-man’s land
-laid by guns which had either escaped destruction by the
British batteries or had remained ‘masked’ (present but silent,
and so undetectable), or else had arrived on the Somme front
towards the conclusion of the bombardment- an event which
had given the German high command all the notice to reinforce
any general could require. The barrage had been particularly
heavy on VIII Corps’ front, perhaps because its gunners were
notably less well-trained even than the rest in that underskilled
army; it was there that there was most uncut wire, additional
proof of incompetent gunnery. <br>
<br>
But for the battalions which had got through, the worst, in a
collective sense, was now over, for entry into the German
positions meant that the German gunners could no longer put
down on them a barrage, their own troops being mixed up with
the attackers, while the attackers themselves could take advantage
of the Germans’ own trenches to shelter from the
German infantry’s bombs and bullets. In practice, things were
less simple and far more dangerous than this thumbnail analysis
suggests, for the British could not remain in the German
trenches they had reached, having objectives to reach which lay
much deeper within German trenches, yet had to remain to
fight for a while if they were not to be attacked in the rear
when they pushed on. The Germans, moreover, had enough
of their telephone cable network intact sometimes to be able
to inform their batteries which trenches were in British
hands, and so to be able to call down fire on them. The British
had no such link with their artillery, the telephone lines they
had trailed across no-man’s-land having almost without exception,
and to no one’s surprise, been cut. As a result, and to
<b>(p.248)</b>
complicate the pattern of activity in those battalions which had
entered the German front line, the attackers were under an
obligation, both to consolidate -clear the captured trench of
any resisting Germans- and to ‘follow the barrage’ -to
walk off whither the next curtain of shellfire played on the
second or third line of German trenches or on an intervening
‘shellhole position’; some divisional artilleries had allowed for
as many as six of these ‘lifts’. <br>
<br>
Following a shrapnel barrage was, for all the tumult produced,
not in itself a dangerous thing to do, given accurate
gunnery, for the cast of shrapnel is forward, only the occasional
base-plate whining back to inflict injury on the infantry behind.
By late 19 I 7 British infantrymen had learnt, and were glad, to
walk as close as twenty-five yards in the rear of a boiling, roaring
cloud of explosive and dust, accepting that it was safer to court
death from the barrage than to hang back and perhaps be
killed by a German whom the shells had spared and one’s own
tardiness allowed the time to pop up from his dug-out. In July
I9I6, however, few gunners knew how to make a barrage
‘creep’ at a regular walking pace across a piece of enemy-held
territory and, prudently, few infantrymen would risk approaching
too close to a barrage line until they saw it lift and move to
the next target. The consequence was that the advance, even
when it worked to plan, took the form of a series of discontinuous
and quite literally breathless jerks forward, the lift of
the barrage to the next objective being the signal for the waiting
infantry to leave their positions of shelter and race the intervening
two or three hundred yards to regain its protection. For
the 18th and 80th Divisions, flanking the French at the extreme
southern end of the battlefield, this programme worked very
well, and both gained all their objectives within the limit of
time set, though each at the loss of about three thousand
casualties. They benefited, however, from their proximity to the
French, whose gunnery, after two years of war, was much
superior to the Royal Artillery’s, and whose infantry, here
belonging to the XX Corps, were among the best soldiers on
the western front. The British Ill Corps’ advance was, therefore,
in the language of the period, to some extent a ‘sympathetic’
one. <br>
<br>
Where, farther north, the British had to make their way
<b>(p.249)</b>
alone, most battalions, even if they managed to get into the
German trenches, sooner or later ‘lost’ the barrage, which they
had to watch grinding noisily and remorselessly away from
them, according to a pre-arranged timetable, and could only
very rarely and with the greatest difficulty recall to work over
the objective on which they were stuck. The reasons for this
‘loss’ of the barrage were everywhere the same: the infantry
arrived in the German front trench either too disorganized by
losses to be able to push on at the time required, or else were
held there so long by the resistance of the German defenders
that the barrage left without them, or else, exhausted by
physical effort and nervous strain more quickly than the staff
had allowed for, stopped to rest. <br>
<br>
Exhaustion was what stopped the advance on the northern
sector of the 21st Division’s front, after a very brave and quick
rush had carried the two leading battalions of the 64th Brigade
deep into the German position. Despite heavy losses from
machine-gun fire in no-man’s-land, the 9th and 10th King’s
Own Yorkshire Light Infantry crossed it, found good gaps in
the German wire, shot or bombed the defenders who opposed
them and took the front trench. Joined there by their
 support
battalions, the 15th Durham Light Infantry and the 1st East
Yorkshire, they moved on behind the barrage to the next
German trench, from which they extracted and sent back
about two hundred German prisoners. All this had taken about
ten minutes, during which half of the soldiers and most of the
officers had been killed or wounded. The barrage now moved
forward, and the battalions were still able to follow, but they
now came across more and more Germans, hidden in shell holes
or bits of trench, who threw bombs or opened fire with
their rifles. At the end of half an hour from zero, by which
time they had covered a mile of ground from their own front
line, the Yorkshiremen reached an old sunken road. Here the
majority stopped- ‘a general halt was called’, is the euphemism
employed by the official historian- though some parties from
all four battalions went on a little farther, to Crucifix Trench,
the brigade’s first objective. Five hundred yards ahead, Germans
had begun to fire machine-guns from positions hidden in
woodland and now ‘the barrage had passed on’. ‘The 9th and
10th K.O.Y.L.I.’s advance was over for the day, the men too
<b>(p.250)</b>
worn out by fatigue and fear to go any farther themselves,
the officers who might have led them dead or wounded. Mter
a long delay, news of the circumstances reached those ‘L.O.O.B.’
-Left Out of Battle to form a cadre if losses were very heavyand
one of the officers, a young captain, Basil Liddell Hart,
went forward through German machine-gun fire to take
command. He remained with survivors throughout the afternoon,
while men were killed and wounded in a succession of
British attacks and German counter-attacks. At nightfall they
were withdrawn.<br>
<br>
On the 8th Division’s front, it was disorganization that caused
the British battalions to lose the barrage. The German artillery
opposite was unsubdued and put down a heavy fire into
no-man’s-land as soon as the infantry reached to within
eighty yards of the wire. They had already suffered from long range
machine-gun fire during the process of scaling the
British parapet, filing out through the gaps in their entanglements,
forming up into waves (each battalion was in four waves
at fifty paces distance), and marching across no-man’s-land,
here, in places, eight hundred yards wide. Under the lash of
the German barrage, the British infantry broke formation and
rushed the wire. At several spots the survivors got into the
German front trench and even beyond it. But most of their
officers had gone down and the groups of attackers were small
and separated from each other. Guessing at their circumstances,
one of the commanding officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Bastard
of the 2nd Lincolns, crossed no-man’s-land alone from the
British side, collected his scattered soldiers and those of a
neighbouring battalion and organized a stretch of the captured
trench for defense. The British barrage, which might have
helped him in this, was now far ahead, playing on positions
which the British had no hope of reaching, let alone taking,
and it was not until 9· I 5 a. m., nearly two hours after zero,
that the matter of recalling it was even discussed between the
divisional commander and his brigadiers. They then told
him that there could be no question of renewing the attack
with their broken brigades and that to put down a barrage
again on the German front line might kill more friends than
enemies. So there things were left. Bastard and his handful
eventually withdrew.
<b>(p.251)</b>
The most frustrating circumstances in which to lose the
barrage were those experienced by battalions which got more
or less intact into the German lines but there encountered such
resolute resistance that they were unable to leave on schedule
for the next objective. Typical of such an experience, though
such experiences were rare on July 1st, was that of the London
Scottish. Part of the 56th London Division, which had been
given the diversionary role of attacking the Gommecourt
salient to the north of Fourth Army’s front, the London
Scottish was one of the most famous Territorial and best of all
battalions in the B.E.F. First of the Territorial infantry to
land in France, it had fought at the First Battle of Ypres in
1914, Givenchy, Festubert and Loos in 1915 and had been in
line opposite the Gommecourt salient since early May. Gommecourt
was an exceptionally strong sector of the trench-line,
where the terrain favoured the defenders, who had done much
over the years to improve on it, and was garrisoned by an
excellent German division, the 2nd Guard Reserve. German
batteries were numerous, the fire of those of the attacked
divisions being supplemented by that of batteries still farther
to the north, beyond the limit of the British offensive. Yet the
London Scottish, together with the other London Territorials,
Queen Victoria’s Rifles, the Queen’s Westminster Rifles, the
Rangers, the London Rifle Brigade, were confident of their
ability to get into the German position and secure it. <br>
<br>
Their confidence was justified. The barrage plan allotted
them half an hour to clear their objectives and join hands with
the 46th North Midland Division’s leaders, who were to
attack concentrically. Leaving their trenches behind a smoke
screen at 7.30 a.m., the London Scottish were at once caught
by a severe standing barrage in no-man’s-land, but pressed
on and, though several officers lost direction in the smoke and
led their men to the wrong sector of trench, got almost everywhere
into the German front line. In several places the Germans
had abandoned it, probably deliberately, at the Scots’ approach,
so there and elsewhere they were able to press on
quickly to the German second trench. On the right, one of the
companies was able to reach and overpass its objective, retiring
when it discovered its mistake. On the left, D Company had
met heavier resistance all along and could not reach its final
<b>(p.252)</b>
objective, a fourth trench line beyond the three it had already
captured. The time was now 8 a.m. and the divisional artillery
shifted its fire, as the timetable required, to the expected point
of junction with the 46th Division, far away on the London
Scots’ left. That left them to their own devices. Worse, they
were now physically isolated for the German standing barrage
did not move, continuing to rain down a curtain of shells in
no-man’s-land all morning and afternoon, preventing the
movement of essential supplies from the British to the captured
German trenches. <br>
<br>
A fresh supply of ammunition and bombs, particularly
bombs, were what quickly became essential to the Scots. For
in their isolation they were subjected to a series of counterattacks
by the Germans, who now surrounded them on three
sides. These counter attacks provide an excellent example of
what trench fighting in the First World War was like and why
it took the form it did. <br>
<br>
The weight of fire overhead, from both field-guns and
machine-guns, kept attackers and defenders alike in the
trenches. The trenches, nevertheless, gave them access to each
other, being part of a continuous system or grid, fire trenches
running in one direction, communication trenches athwart
them in another. The two sides, however, would rarely see
each other, because both fire and communication trenches
were ‘traversed’- dug in angular kinks to deny an attacker the
chance of firing down the whole length of the trench and to
localize the blast of any shell which fell into it. In these circumstances,
friend and foe could approach very close without
being able, though aware of each other’s presence, to do each
other much harm in the conventional way. An impasse could
result- to be resolved sometimes by an individual or group
on one side or the other deciding to ‘go out over the top’ or
‘go above ground’. Sergeant Gurney of D Company was killed
doing that during the initial advance, jumping up the side of
the trench to get at some Germans who were holding up the
attack round a corner. The normal method of resolving the
impasse, however, was by ‘bombing’, the throwing of a hand grenade
over the top of the traverse, and running round to
arrive just after it exploded. If played seriously, it was an
extremely dangerous game, for one could run into the explosion
<b>(p.253)</b>
of one’s own grenade, or into the fire of an unwounded enemy
soldier, or into the grenade of someone bombing from the next
traverse up. Equally, it could be nearly a sham combat, with the
two sides sticking prudently to their own traverses and the
grenades falling harmlessly in the bay between them. Here in
the trenches which the London Scottish had captured it became
something else: a static attritional affair, the Scots having
blown in several sections of trench around them, using explosives
brought by accompanying Royal Engineers, and so having
enclosed themselves in an earthwork stockade. Inside it they
ought to have been secure and could have expected eventually
to have the section of trench they had captured incorporated
in the British system on the other side of no-man’s-land by new
digging. Several circumstances militated against this outcome:
they were overlooked from three sides; the trenches had been
so knocked about by the British bombardment that the occupants
were exposed to fire in many places; the Germans had
artillery available to bombard them from close range, and
fresh infantry to deliver counter-attacks; the barrage in no-man’s-
land prevented either supplies or reinforcements from
crossing. On the far side, the London Scots’ commanding
officer, who had been Left Out of Battle, became aware of his
companies’ plight, and got together a relief party. It set off in
three groups between 9 and IO a.m., each burdened with
bandoliers of ammunition and boxes of bombs. Only three of
the fifty-nine who started got through, and though this does not
mean that all the rest were hit, some presumably deciding to
take shelter in shell-holes, the figures do testify to the weight of
fire which the Germans were laying on and over the London
Scots’ position. Two of the four company commanders were
by then out of action and, soon after 2 p.m. a third was killed.
The burden of managing the defense now fell wholly upon the
fourth, Captain Sparks. ‘The better to direct the fighting, he
was often seen standing and moving on the unbroken ground
between the trenches’ -conduct which would have attracted
admiration at Waterloo and, when displayed on a First World
War battlefield, beggars powers of eulogy. His men, though
less exposed, were steadily being wounded or killed by bomb-blast
or sniping shots, and though his garrison was occasionally
reinforced by refugees from even harder pressed battalions on
<b>(p.254)</b>
his left flank- the Rangers, Kensingtons and Queen Victoria’s
-it was dwindling in strength. The men who were left were
running out of ammunition fast and, like defenders of some
imperial fortlet on the veldt or the Frontier, kept their rifles
going throughout the hot afternoon with rounds extracted
from the pouches of the casualties. By 4 p.m. Captain Sparks
recognized that his tiny force, now under attack by thirteen
German infantry companies from three different regiments,
was about to go under. He sent the following message back
across no-man’s-land: ‘I am faced with this position. I have
collected all bombs and [cartridges] from casualties. Every one
has been used. I am faced with three alternatives: (a) to stay
here with such of my men as are alive and be killed. (b) to
surrender to the enemy (c) to withdraw such of my men as I
can. Either of these first two alternatives is distasteful to me.
I propose to adopt the latter.’ Using discarded German rifles
and ammunition, he and four N.C.O.s made a final stand in
the German front trench while the other survivors escaped into
no-man’s-land. There most of them, including Sparks, hid until
darkness fell and allowed them to regain the British lines.
During the day, the London Scottish, which had numbered
856 at dawn, had been reduced by death or wounds to 266.
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> The View from across No-man’ s-land</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Such was one result, duplicated at thirty or forty other points
up and down the Somme battlefront on the evening of July 1st,
of trusting in the power of contemporary artillery to destroy
an enemy position and ‘shoot the infantry through’ its ruins.
The four forms of failure just examined do not exhaust the list
of mishaps consequent on such an undertaking. The Ulster
Division failed to carry its final objective, after a very rapid
advance to its first, because the British barrage actually held it
up, so allowing the Germans time to man with reinforcements
brought from the rear positions which the Ulstermen would
otherwise have found empty. Understandably, therefore, the
Ulster Division counted July 1st a victory and the date, which
also happens to coincide with the anniversary of the Battle
<b>(p.255)</b>
of the Boyne (Old Style), is observed by the Protestants of the
province as one of their holy days. Again, some battalions’
attacks failed because their supports could not or would not
follow the trail they had blazed into the German positions, so
leaving them cut off deep within the enemy lines. This seems
to have been the fate of some of the I 2th York and Lancasters,
whose graves were found on November 13th, at the very end
of the battle, when the village of Serre, one of the uncaptured
first- day objectives, at last fell into British hands. Many
battalions of the second wave failed to make their attacks work
because, arriving in the German trenches, they became so
intermingled with the survivors of a battalion which had gone
over before them that they lost order and cohesion themselves.
But some battalions, one should not forget, succeeded. The 7th
Division took some, the 18th most, the 30th all its first objectives,
and battalions of the 2 I st and 34th secured sizeable sections
of the German trenches opposite their own. The French,
better-trained, more experienced and with much more heavy
artillery, had taken all their first-day objectives, and would
have gone on if the plan had provided for unexpected success.
The first day of the Somme had not been a complete military
failure. <br>
<br>
But it had been a human tragedy. The Germans, with about
sixty battalions on the British Somme front, though about forty
in the line, say about thirty-five thousand soldiers, had had
killed or wounded about six thousand. Bad enough; but it was
in the enormous disparity between their losses and the British
that the weight of the tragedy lies: the German 180th Regiment
lost 280 men on July 1st out of about three thousand; attacking
it, the British 8th Division lost 5,121 out of twelve thousand.
In all the British had lost about sixty thousand, of whom
twenty-one thousand had been killed, most in the first hour of
the attack, perhaps the first minutes. ‘The trenches’, wrote
Robert Kee fifty years later, ‘were the concentration camps of
the First World War’; and though the analogy is what an
academic reviewer would call unhistorical, there is something
Treblinka-like about almost all accounts of July 1st, about those
long docile lines of young men, shoddily uniformed, heavily
burdened, numbered about their necks, plodding forward
across a featureless landscape to their own extermination
<b>(p.256)</b>
inside the barbed wire. Accounts of the Somme produce in
readers and audiences much the same range of emotions as do
descriptions of the running of Auschwitz- guilty fascination,
incredulity, horror, disgust, pity and anger- and not only
from the pacific and tender-hearted; not only from the military
historian, on whom, as he recounts the extinction of this brave
effort or that, falls an awful lethargy, his typewriter keys
tapping leadenly on the paper to drive the lines of print, like
the waves of a Kitchener battalion failing to take its objective,
more and more slowly towards the foot of the page; but also
from professional soldiers. Anger is the response which the
story of the Somme most commonly evokes among professionals.
Why did the commanders not do something about it? Why did
they let the attack go on? Why did they not stop one battalion
following in the wake of another to join it in death? <br>
<br>
Some battalions were stopped. On the northern face of the
Gommecourt salient, where the 46th North Midland Division’s
attack had failed completely with heavy loss in the morning,
one of the brigade commanders, Brigadier-General H. B.
Williams, who had seen the 1/6th North Staffordshire and
1 /6th South Staffordshire massacred shortly after zero, declined
to send forward their sister battalions, the 1/8th North Staffords
and the 1/8th South Staffords, later in the afternoon. The
whole of the 1oth and 12th Brigades, in 4th Division, were
held back from a pointless renewal of the attack north of
Beaumont Hamel about the same time, and in the evening
General de Lisle, commanding the 29th Division, countermanded
orders for the 1/4th and 1/8th King’s Own Yorkshire
Light infantry, which had been brought forward from X
Corps’ reserve, to make a further attempt on the corpse-strewn
slopes of Thiepval. There were other reprieves, but the majority
of battalions scheduled to attack did so, no matter what had
happened to those which had preceded them. There are a
number of ways of explaining why this should have been so.
Normal military sense of commitment to a plan was one
reason, the spirit of contemporary generalship, schooled to
believe in the inevitability of heavy casualties another, the
mood of self-sacrifice which had the Kitchener armies in its
grip a third. But most important of all was the simple ignorance
of what was happening which prevailed almost everywhere
<b>(p.257)</b>
on the British side of no-man’s-land throughout most of the
day. <br>
<br>
Even sixty years later, it is very difficult to discover much
that is precise, detailed and human about the fate of a great
number of the battalions of the Fourth Army on July 1st.
Many of the London Territorial regiments, with a strong and
long-established sense of identity, a middle-class character,
and personal connections with metropolitan journalism and
publishing, produced after the war excellent regimental
histories in which the official chronicle is supplemented and
illuminated by a great deal of personal reminiscence from
literate and articulate survivors. The regular battalions of the
Guards and the regiments of the line added copiously to their
existing histories. But, as we have seen, the Somme was predominantly
a battle of humbler and more transient groups
than these, over which the regular army had temporarily cast
the cloak of its identity, but which at the peace vanished from
public memory almost as quickly as they had been conjured
into existence. It was not a deliberate act of obscuration. The
regular regiments which had raised the greatest number of
‘Service’ battalions were often the least affluent (the rough
rule of thumb in calculating the social status of an English
regiment is that the farther from London its depot, the less
fashionable will it be, and the less monied its officers) and the
least able therefore to stand the expense of printing a really
exhaustive history. There was moreover a difficulty about
sources. The principal source of a unit’s history is the War
Diary, which the intelligence officer is supposed to write up
daily. When he is an amateur its contents tend always to be
sketchy, and when action is intense and casualties heavy it may
run for days in arrears, later to be written up for form’s sake
from a single, sometimes second-hand memory of events. All
these caveats apply to the War Diaries of July 1st. Consequent
uncertainty about the experience of particular Kitchener
battalions has added an extra poignancy to their collective
story. The uncertainties might have remained forever undispersed.
At the very last moment, however, a Lincolnshire
farmer, Martin Middlebrook, in whom a chance visit to the
war cemeteries of the Somme in the late nineteen-sixties
aroused an obsessive curiosity about the nature and fate of the
<b>(p.258)</b>
Kitchener armies, embarked on a quest to discover survivors
of July Ist, and in a truly heroic effort of historical fieldwork,
found and interviewed 546 of them, by then, with the exception
of a few enlisted under age, men of seventy or over. <br>
<br>
The book which he made from his interviews is a remarkable
achievement, comparable with Siborne’s history of Waterloo,
constructed on the same basis, and certainly fit to stand beside
it, as well as being a great deal more readable.* But whereas
Siborne addressed his inquiries to all surviving officers, and
from their replies was able to piece together a meaningful
account of the battle, Middlebrook’s answers came, of course,
only from the junior ranks whose view was a very local one
and which collectively depict almost indecipherable chaos.
We have already seen what Siborne’s correspondents had to
say about the limitations which the circumstances of battle
imposed on the grasp of the passage of events. What Middlebrook’s
evidence emphasizes is the extent to which a hundred
years of technological change had further reduced the range of
effective vision on the battlefield, particularly in those not
familiar with the realities of war. ‘On my left,’ wrote a private
of the Ij8th Royal Warwicks, of the scene at zero hour, ‘I could
see large shell bursts as the West Yorks advanced and saw many
men falling forward. I thought at first they were looking for
nose-caps (a favourite souvenir) and it was some time before
I realised they were hit.’ On the far side of no-man’s-land, ‘I
found the German wire well cut,’ wrote a private of the 4th
Tyneside Scottish, ‘but only three of our company got past
there. There was my lieutenant, a sergeant and myself. The
rest seemed to have been hit in no-man’s-land ... the officer
said, “God, God, where’s the rest of the boys?”’ Private
Tomlinson, of the I /7th Sherwood Foresters, accompanied
his commanding officer across no-man’s-land, who had gone to
find out for himself what was happening to his battalion.
‘When we got to the German wire I was absolutely amazed
to see it intact, after what we had been told. The colonel and
I took cover behind a small bank but after a bit the colonel
raised himself on his hands and knees to see better. Immediately
he was hit on the forehead by a single bullet.’<br>
<br>
With a view of events so hard and dangerous to come by at

* The First Day on the Somme by Martin Middle brook.

<b>(p.259)</b>
close quarters with the enemy, it is to be taken for granted
that in the British lines a composite picture of the battle was
even more difficult to piece together. Rowland Feilding, a
Coldstream Guardsman who had come up to observe the
battle from a point opposite Mametz, wrote to his wife, ‘the
sight was inspiring and magnificent. From right to left, but
particularly opposite the French . . . the whole horizon seemed
to be on fire, the bursting shells blending with smoke from the
burning villages . . . this is a district of long views. Never was
there a field better suited for watching military operations.’
But Feilding was there as a sight-seer, seeking sensation, not
precise information. A sight-seer with a more professionally
inquisitive motive, J. F. C. Fuller, found on arrival ‘an intense
bombardment . . . in full swing, and so much dust and smoke
[covering] the Gommecourt salient that it was difficult to see
anything clearly. At five minutes to zero a somewhat scattered
smoke barrage was put down, then came the attack across no man’s-
land. I cannot say that I saw it. All I can vouch for is
that a little later on through my glasses I did see several groups
of men, presumably of the I 39 Brigade, moving towards
Pigeon Wood.’ A commanding officer on the Gommecourt
sector, almost under Fuller’s eyes, Colonel Dickens, of Queen
Victoria’s Rifles, saw even less than he did: ‘For two hours after
zero, no news whatsoever was received from the front,’ (which
was only about a thousand yards distant) ‘all communications,
visual and telephonic having failed. Beyond answering appeals
from the Brigade’ (next headquarters upward) ‘for information,
we had leisure to observe what was going on.’ But he learnt
nothing until, after nine o’clock, he was visited by ‘two plucky
runners who [had] returned to our line through the barrage’. <br>
<br>
Why should he have had to depend on runners? The reason
is simple to explain. The communication system in Fourth
Army, resembling in essentials that installed up and down the
Western Front and on both sides of no-man’s-land, was a
comprehensive one. It was based on the telephone and the
telegraph, the latter replacing the former where amplification
was difficult to ensure, and ran through an extremely elaborate
network of ‘land line’ and ‘air line’. Air lines from the major
headquarters- G.H.Q. at Montreuil and Fourth Army H.Q.
at Querrieux, fifteen miles from the front- to Corps, and
<b>(p.260)</b>
Division, with as much lateral branching as was necessary to
make communication to a flank possible. Forward of Division,
to Brigade and Battalion, the lines left their poles to descend
earthward, becoming ‘land lines’, by this stage of the war no
longer strung vulnerably along the walls of the communication
trenches, but buried under the duckboards on the floor.
The nearer it approached the front trench, the deeper was it
buried, until in the forward zone it reached a depth of six feet.
The installation of this ‘six-foot bury’ had been one of the most
time-consuming preparations for the offensive, but was justified
by the security of communication it provided even under the
heaviest enemy shellfire. It had, however, one disabling shortcoining:
it stopped at the edge of no-man’s-land. Once the
troops left their trenches, as at 7.30 a.m. on July 1st, they
passed beyond the carry of their signals system into the unknown.
The army had provided them with some makeshifts
to indicate their position: rockets, tin triangles sewn to the
backs of their packs as air recognition symbols, lamps and
flags, and some one-way signalling expedients, Morse shutters,
semaphore flags and carrier pigeons; but none were to prove
of real use on July 1st. Indeed, these items seem only to have
further encumbered men already heavily laden, in a fashion
more reminiscent of explorers setting off on an expedition than
soldiers entering battle. The story of Scott’s Last Expedition,
news of which had magnetized the English-speaking world
on the eve of the war, may have seemed, as it does in retrospect,
of special significance to a reflective soldier of the Fourth
Army as, bowed under the weight of rations and protective
clothing, he prepared to leave base-camp for the dash to the
final objective on the evening of June 30th; it has its parallels
in the fate of the vanished party of the I 2th York and Lancasters,
whose bodies were discovered five months after the
attack in the heart of the German position. <br>
<br>
That a party could disappear so completely, not in the
Antarctic wastes but at a point aimost within visual range of
their own lines, seems incomprehensible today, so attuned
are we to thinking of wireless providing instant communication
across the battlefield. But the cloud of unknowing which
descended on a First World War battlefield at zero hour was
accepted as one of its hazards by contemporary generals. Since
<b>(p.261)</b>
the middle of the nineteenth century, the width of battlefields
had been extending so rapidly that no general could hope to
be present, as Wellington had made himself, at each successive
point of crisis; since the end of the century the range and
volume of small-arms fire had been increasing to such an
extent that no general could hope to survey, as Wellington had
done, the line of battle from the front rank. The main work
of the general, it had been accepted, had now to be done in his
office, before the battle began; and indeed one of the pieces of
Inilitary literature most talked of in the British army before the
First World War was a short story, A Sense of Proportion, by
General Sir Edward Swinton, which had as its central character
a general- obviously based on the great Moltke- who, having
made his dispositions on the eve of battle, spends its hours
casting flies for trout, serene in the assurance- which the
story’s conclusion vindicates- that he had done all he could.
No British general spent July 1st fishing. But the spirit which
informs the plans laid by the Fourth Army, whether those of
a formation like XIII Corps (equivalent in size to Wellington’s
Waterloo army) which ran to thirty-one pages (Wellington
issued no written plan for Waterloo), or of a unit like Queen
Victoria’s Rifles, a force of under a thousand men, which run
to twenty numbered paragraphs, is essentially Swintonian. It
is a spirit not of providing for eventualities, but rather of
attempting to preordain the future; a spirit borne out by the
language of the orders : ‘infantry and machine-guns will be
pushed forward at once ... ‘; ‘the siege and heavy artillery will
be advanced .. .’ ‘Mter the capture of their final objective the
30th Division will be relieved by the 8th Division .. .’ Man’s
attempts at preordination are always risky and require as a
minimum precondition for success the co-operation of all concerned.
Upon that of the Germans the British could not of
course count. Consequently, at every point where the future
threatened to resist preordination, Haig and Rawlinson had
reinsured themselves -by lengthening the duration of the
bombardment, adding to the targets to be destroyed, increasing
the ratio of troops to space. <br>
<br>
The effect of these reinsurances was to complicate the plan.
And the complication of a plan which would depend for its
success on the smooth interaction of a very large number of
<b>(p.261)</b>
mutually dependent elements invited its frustration. Interaction
requires articulation, to adopt the language with which
J. F. C. Fuller was fond of obscuring military truths; which
means that if major operations are to be carried through in the
teeth of enemy resistance, commanders must at all times be
able to talk to their troops, troops to their supporting artillery
and so on. Such conversations were easily arranged while
everyone was on the same side of no-man’s-land. But once the
infantry departed on their journey, conversation stopped, to be
carried on, if at all, through the medium of the battalion
runners, upon whose messages Colonel Dickens, for example,
had to rely for news, two hours old, of the progress of his fighting
companies. <br>
<br>
Discontinuities of this order in the receipt of information,
particularly when the information concerned difficulties or
failure, made the management of a battle, in the tactile and
instantaneous fashion open to Wellington at Waterloo, impossible.
Commanders could not discover where the soldiers
were: ‘Observation of troops, on account of the smoke and dust,
was extremely difficult, and although two contact patrol aeroplanes
displayed amazing daring, flying along the front sometimes
only fifty feet above the troops under heavy small-arms
fire, no definite information could be obtained’ (of the 4th
Division in mid-morning) ; hard-pressed battalions could not
ask their supporting batteries for fire support: the 14th Brigade,
pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire from Thiepval at
8.45 a.m., could not get the promise of a barrage until 12.05
p.m.; carefully rehearsed soldiers failed to co-operate in changes
of plan which events made necessary: ‘a party (of the 56th
Division) told off to carry concertina wire could not for some
time be got to understand that they must drop their loads and
help to form an attacking wave.’ Throughout the morning and
afternoon, Rawlinson, at Querrieux, and Haig, in his advanced
headquarters at the Chateau de Beauquesne, ten miles to the
north, attempted to follow the battle from scraps of imprecise
information several hours old. Neither made real sense of it.
Neither, very wisely, ordered any substantive changes of plan.
Many of the gunners, whose fire, if properly directed, would
have been so effective in saving British lives, also remained,
though closer at hand, inactive spectators: ‘On the whole’,
<b>(p.263)</b>
wrote Neil Fraser Tytler of a Lancashire Territorial Field
Brigade, ‘we had a very delightful day; .. with nothing to do
except send numerous reports through to Head Quarters and
observe the stupendous spectacle before us. There was nothing
to do as regards controlling my battery’s fire, as the barrage
orders had all been prepared beforehand.’ Throughout this
period, the only group of soldiers with precise information to
offer of the whereabouts and circumstances of their units were
the battalion runners. It is ironic to reflect that the taunt
thrown into the faces of so many highly trained German Great
General Staff officers, excluded by official policy from service
m the trenches, by Hitler, ex-runner of the 16th Bavarian
Reserve Regiment- that he knew more about the realities of
war than they- had after all a coarse grain of truth to it.
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> The Wounded </i></b></center><br>
<br>
Given that the high command spent most of July 1st in ignorance
Of how the Fourth Army was faring, its passivity is excusable;
given its silence, the persistence of lower headquarters,
too, m sucking to the plan is quite understandable. Nor were
the military consequences of their inertia disastrous not at
least in the short term. For the Germans on the Somme were
far too weak, in men, in artillery, in ancillary means, to have
bought of snatching profit from the British army’s disorganization
by a quick counter-offensive. Looked at in these terms
therefore, the continuation of the attack throughout the da;
did not compound the military error. But it did multiply
the. scale and prolong the duration of the human suffering
which the battle brought, by a factor difficult to quantify but
certainly very large indeed. It caused many more men to be
wounded than any sort of necessity required and left those
wounded early on to agonize in no-man’s-land throughout the
day. <br>
<br>
Waterloo wounds, when not instantly lethal, had had in
many. cases extreme unpleasant consequences, fatal septicemia
and pentorutls being the most obvious. But Waterloo
wounds (cannon wounds apart) had been in general single and
<b>(p.264)</b>
simple: penetrations or perforations by lances or low-velocity
bullets, cuts by swords. If the bleeding they caused was not too
severe, if dirt was not carried into the wound or the intestines
opened, the patient’s chances of survival were better than we
would expect. The wounds suffered by the human body on
the Somme were of a far greater variety and degree of severity
than any Waterloo surgeon would have seen. Edged-weapon
wounds would have almost disappeared, for though the marks
of bayonets were found on a number of bodies, it was presumed
that they had been inflicted after the victim was dead; the best
statistic available is that edged-weapon wounds were a fraction
of one per cent of all wounds inflicted in the First World War.
Bullet wounds were far more frequent, amounting to about
thirty per cent of all new wounds, but probably forming a
greater proportion on the first day of the Somme, because of
the unusual targets presented to the machine-gunners. Shell
and bomb wounds were probably reduced in proportion for
the same reason, but usually amounted to about seventy per
cent of those inflicted. Shell wounds were the most to be feared,
because of the multiple effects shell explosion could produce in
the human body. At its worst it could disintegrate a human
being, so that nothing recognizable- sometimes apparently
nothing at all- remained of him: ‘a signaller had just stepped
out,’ recalled the medical officer of the 2nd Royal Welch
Fusiliers, of a later battle, ‘when a shell burst on him, leaving
not a vestige that could be seen anywhere near.’ A little
beforehand he had witnessed another equally frightening and
fatal consequence of shell fire: ‘two men suddenly rose into
the air vertically, 15 feet perhaps, amid a spout of soil 150 yards
ahead. They rose and fell with the easy, graceful poise of
acrobats. A rifle, revolving slowly, rose high above them before,
still revolving, it fell. The sight recalled, even in these surroundings,
a memory of boyhood: a turn that thrilled me in a
travelling circus at St. Andrews.’ Less spectacular, but sometimes
as deadly, shell blast could create over-pressures or
vacuums in the body’s organs, rupturing the lungs and producing
haemorrhages in the brain and spinal cord. It was effects
of this sort which killed three Welch Fusiliers ‘sitting in a shell hole
... with no more visible mark on them than some singeing
of their clothing.’ Much the most common wounding by shell
<b>(p.265)</b>
fire, however, was by splinter or shrapnel ball. Such projectiles
travelled fairly slowly, and rapidly lost their velocity; to that
extent, they were less to be feared than bullet wounds. But they
often travelled in clusters, which would inflict several large
or many small wounds on the same person. The splinters were
irregular in shape, so producing a very rough wound with a
great deal of tissue damage, and they frequently carried fragments
of clothing or other foreign matter into the body, which
made infection almost inevitable. Very large shell fragments
could, like Waterloo cannon-balls, amputate limbs, decapitate,
bisect or otherwise grossly mutilate the human frame. <br>
<br>
As a killing agent over long as well a short ranges, however,
the bullet was champion. Unlike the musket-ball which, moving
at slow speed and without rotating, merely drove a clean path
for itself through soft tissue, the high-velocity conical bullet,
spinning quickly about its long axis, could produce inside the
human body a variety of extremely unpleasant results. At best,
it left a neat channel, with the ‘exit’ wound the same size as
the ‘entry’. Should it be caused to ‘tumble’ inside the body,
however, either on hitting bone or for some ballistic reason,
its path beyond the point of tumble became very much enlarged
and the exit wound -often mistaken by amateurs for the
entry- ‘explosive’ in appearance. The effects of a tumble
produced by striking bone were enhanced by the bone’s
splintering under the impact, its own fragments then becoming
secondary projectiles which produced massive damage to
tissues round about. Some bullets also set up hydraulic effects,
their passage driving body fluids away from the wound track
at pressures which surrounding tissues could not withstand.
The lower frequency of bullet wounds, noted in the medical
statistics, may thus have been due to the bullet’s greater
initial lethality, for doctors noted the nature of wounds brought
to them for treatment, not those inflicted on the bodies of all
soldiers. It is suspicious, for example, that, at one major
Casualty Clearing Station, the proportion of bullet wounds of
the chest to all other gunshot wounds was, during a year of
serious fighting, about three per cent. <br>
<br>
Much of the wounding produced by the weapons of trench
warfare, to say nothing of its volume, was new to surgeons. All
armies, and particularly the British, had made remarkably
<b>(p.266)</b>
successful efforts, however, to meet the surgical problems with
which the war confronted them. For the Somme, and for some
time beforehand, bed space had been provided to receive every
wounded soldier evacuated from a battle; anesthetics, antiseptics,
dressings and instruments were freely available (and
every soldier carried, sewn to his uniform, a packet containing
a sterile ‘first field dressing’). Blood, typed by Landsteiner just
before the war, was now known to be safely transferable, and
was fairly freely transfused from I 9 I 7 onwards. Surgical technique
was highly developed and was adapted with admirable
flexibility to the types of wounds the war produced; the
principle of ‘debridement’, or the removal of damaged tissue
(‘debris’) from the site of the wound, was established by 1915,
and, when applied early on as a general rule, was remarkably
effective in preventing the onset of one of the most feared
consequences of major muscular damage, gas gangrene (an
infection contracted from soil-organisms carried into the wound
when the victim fell to the ground). But much surgery had
perforce to be radical, decisions for amputation being far
commoner than they would be in the Second World War,
when bone-grafting and other reconstructive techniques had
been brought to a higher level of development. And, in cases
of gross abdominal, chest and head wounds, where infection
was present from the outset, surgery offered no remedy. None
would be found until antibiotics became available towards the
end of 1943. <br>
<br>
Still, despite the intensification of the hazards with which
battle threatened the soldier of the First World War, the care
which medicine could provide had been made to keep pace.
The infrastructure of the medical service was impressive in
scope. Parallel to the complicated networks of supply and
communication, emplaced to transport the soldier into battle
and provide him with essentials while there- the buried cable
system, railheads, roadheads, tramways, Corps and Divisional
dumps, workshops, Field Ordnance Parks- was an equally
elaborate system to evacuate him from battle if he was hit,
treat his wounds and restore him to health (and so to the
fighting line). The first point in the system was the Regimental
Aid Post, where the battalion medical officer sorted the casualties,
separated the dying, and sent those he could not treat Call
<b>(p.267)</b>
but the very lightly wounded) off down the line, sedated and
bandaged. Their destination was the Casualty Clearing Station,
via the Dressing Station and the Collecting Post, from which
they would be transported by train to a Stationary or Base
Hospital, either in France or in Britain. At the beginning of the
war, the practice was to delay operation until the patient had
been brought to the comprehensive facilities available at the
base. But as it became clear that several categories of wounds
‘travelled’ badly, notably those of the chest and abdomen,
the practice developed of initiating major surgery farther
and farther forward. By I 916 the Casualty Clearing Station
had become the principal seat of life-saving surgery, but it
was also undertaken by special travelling surgical teams in
Advanced Dressing Stations, within medium-gun range of the
enemy. <br>
<br>
There remained, nevertheless, a brutal selectivity about
military surgery which the practitioners did their best to hide
from the patients but could not disguise from themselves. It
was called ‘triage’, or ‘the division into three’, from the vocabulary
of the French army which had instituted it, and
required surgeons, from the press of casualties flowing in
during a battle, to send on those who could stand the journey
and to choose, from the group remaining, which men were
worth subjecting to serious surgery and which must be left to
die; the greater the press of casualties, the larger the latter
group. A Casualty Clearing Station usually contained a special
tent, known tacitly as the moribund ward, in which the
unlucky third of the triage group were congregated.<br>
<br>
But ‘unlucky’ is a very relative term to use in such circumstances.
The patients of the moribund ward were sedated,
washed, fed, given to drink, comforted by female nurses,
shielded from the fact of their approaching death. To have
reached the moribund ward was to have been spared the worst
which battle could inflict on the wounded soldier of that or
indeed of any war, and which the wounded of the Somme
suffered in their thousands on July 1st: to die alone and in pain
on the battlefield. For in the elaborate chain of medical arrangements
provided by Fourth Army was a weak or perhaps missing
link. To the rear of the Advanced Dressing Station, transport
was plentiful; forward of the Regimental Aid Post, transport
<b>(p.268)</b>
was very sparse. The evacuation of the wounded in a battalion
fell on thirty-two stretcher bearers, capable of carrying sixteen
wounded between them, and needing an hour or more for
each journey. But in many battalions on July 1st, over three
hundred men were wounded; or, rather, arrived wounded at
the Regimental Aid Post. These included a majority of lightly
wounded, who could evacuate themselves, and those of the
more seriously wounded found still alive on the British side of
no-man’s-land. But what of those lying farther away?
Some men wounded close to the British front line, shot
through the head, chest or the major blood vessels, would
have died however quickly collected by the stretcher bearers;
that went also for men wounded in the same way nearer the
German lines. But there was a category of wounds of intermediate
gravity- punctures of the lungs (‘sucking wounds’),
leading to a fatal loss of oxygen in the blood, punctures of the
abdomen, causing internal bleeding and threatening peritonitis
-which would leave the victim alive for some time and from
which he would eventually recover if he could be got swiftly to
treatment. Both these and other less serious wounds would be
associated with the phenomenon known as ‘shock’ in which
the blood volume falls and can only be restored by outside
assistance. It is very difficult to estimate what proportion of
the wounded of July rst would have suffered this type of
injury. But the chest and abdomen form about fifty per cent
of the surface of the body presented, when upright, to enemy
projectiles; skin surface covering the spine and great vessels - the
heart and the major arteries- is less than half of that. We
may therefore conclude that about a quarter of wounds received
which were not immediately fatal were to the chest and
abdomen. To this category of critical wounds, we should add
fractures of the thigh, with which massive shock and heavy
bleeding are almost always associated, and penetrations of the
skull which, without antibiotics, frequently led to fatal abscesses
of the brain if surgery was delayed longer than twelve hours.
Perhaps a third, therefore, of the wounds inflicted on July 1st
were of the ‘critical but not immediately fatal’ variety.
Those who suffered such wounds on the wrong side of
no-man’s-land, or inside the German positions, particularly
on the sectors where the British attack failed or was violently
<b>(p.269)</b>
resisted, had a very poor expectation of life. In many places,
and at a surprisingly early stage of the battle, the Germans
offered the British an unofficial and unilateral truce: at about
2 p.m. on the front of the 56th London, Division, where ‘a
German medical officer ... came out with a white flag and said
that there was no objection to the removal of wounded on the
British side of the wire, so long as no firing took place’, and
on VIII Corps’ front, where the Germans allowed stretcher
bearers to move freely about no-man’s-land between noon and
4 p.m: But elsewhere the wounded had to lie out until darkness,
or until next morning, when the Germans again in several
places offered a humanitarian truce, or indeed until even later
than that. On the Ill Corps’ front it was not until July 3rd
that all wounded had been carried off the field, on the X Corps’
front not until noon on July 4th, and that despite the conscription
of large numbers of engineers and gunners to act as
stretcher-bearers. Gerald Brenan, crossing the battlefield to
visit his friend Ralph Partridge three weeks later, stumbled
upon the consequence of the delay: ‘The wounded, who could
not be brought in, had crawled into shell holes, wrapped their
waterproof sheets round them, taken out their Bibles, and died
like that.’* It may be, therefore, that as many as a third of the
21,000 killed and missing on July 1st died as a result of wounds
from which they would have had a chance of recovering if
they could have been brought even to the Regimental Aid
Post within the first hours of injury.

<center><b><i> The Will to Combat </i></b></center><br>
<br>
The late-twentieth-century soldier does not expect to be left to
die of his wounds on the battlefield. For the reduction of delay
in evacuating the wounded soldiers from the point of injury
to the point of first aid in the period since 1918 has been
striking, and represents easily the most important of the many
advances achieved in modern military medicine. In Western
armies during the Second World War, the delay between
suffering injury and arriving at the aid post was commonly
<b>(p.269)</b>
reduced to under an hour; in Vietnam, where ‘casualty
evacuation’ helicopter pilots were trained to land in the fire zone
and under fire, it averaged fifteen minutes- rather less
than the victim of a civilian traffic accident might spend in an
ambulance. The patient moreover can now be transfused in
the helicopter and landed at a hospital offering a complete
range of resuscitation facilities and expert surgery in a variety
of specialties. Today the victim is unlucky who, escaping death
outright, succumbs to the effects of his wounds.
The early-twentieth-century soldier already perceived the
hope of life which the novel combination of expert surgery,
anesthetics and asepsis offered if he should be hit; but it was
a perception less immediate than that which he had of the
dangers, enormously magnified since Waterloo, of the battlefield
on which he had to move and of the gravity, equally
magnified, of the sort of wound he could suffer on it. What,
given these perceptions, was it which impelled him to leave
cover, advance and engage in combat in such circumstances?
Not everyone, even at high moments of the war, was prepared
to do so. On the eve of the Somme, quintessentially a high
moment, a number of soldiers inflicted wounds on themselves
to avoid having to ‘jump the parapet’.* At low moments of
the war, of which the later stages of the Third Battle of Ypres
(‘Paschendaele’) yielded many, some British battalions realistically
accepted that some men would not or could not stand
the strain of action and excused them from duty: ‘to gratify a

• Is the self-inflicted wound (‘S.I.W.’) a phenomenon produced by the
First World War, risked despite the legal penalty attached because of
recent advances in medicine? Nineteenth-century Russian serfs had been
given to knocking out their front teeth, with which soldiers bit the old
musket cartridge, so as to avoid conscription. But instances of selfwounding,
before the development of antiseptics, have escaped me.
Modern medicine has however made a wound inflicted by the enemy
or by genuine accident - the latter at least five per cent of all woundings
between 1914 and 1918 - a very desirable passport off the battlefield:
‘a comfortable wound’, wrote Maurice Bowra, ‘was an act of God much
to be welcomed’; ‘to them a wound’, wrote Hanbury-Sparrow of his
soldiers, ‘no matter how slight, terminates all moral obligation to go on’;
‘When the whistle blew,’ recalled F. W. A. Turner of his jump-off on July
ut, ‘the first man up my ladder was an American, Private Martin: As
soon as he reached the top he was shot through the wrist. He came straight
back. “I’ve got mine,’’ he said, “I’m off.’”
<b>(p.271)</b>
mawkish humanitarianism,’ wrote the excessively tough-minded
medical officer of the 2nd Royal Welch Fusiliers on October
I 5th, I 9 I 7 ‘two or three score mean fellows are encouraged to
slip away every time there is risk to their skins, so more and
more average men learn to shirk with impunity; attacks fail,
and losses run into untold thousands, because the most dutiful
of our men are not backed up.’ And, taking a very broad view
of the war, a point was reached in every army at which either
a majority or a disabling minority refused to go on. This point
was reached by the French army in May I917, when ‘collective
indiscipline’ occurred in 54 of the I r o divisions on the Western
Front; in the Russian Army in July 1917, when it failed to
resist the German counter-attack consequent on the collapse of
the ‘Kerensky Offensive’; in the Italian army in November
1917, when the Second Army disintegrated under German Austrian
attack at Caporetto. In March 1918, the British
Fifth Army collapsed, as much morally as physically, and in
October the German army in the west signified to its officers its
unwillingness to continue fighting. In each case, excepting
Germany’s, and if we count the battle of Loos in September 1915
as Britain’s introduction to heavy losses, the moment of collapse
occurred between two years six months and two years eleven
months after the outbreak. However, it is probably not the lapse
of time which is significant, but the relationship of total casualties
to the number of fighting troops engaged; a rough calculation,
and anything better than a rough calculation is difficult
with such notoriously unreliable statistics as casualty figures, suggests
that the break came soon after the total number of deaths
suffered equaled the number of fighting infantry in the
divisions. Counting the fighting infantry of a division at
10,000, and die number of British, French, Italian and Russian
divisions engaged against the central powers as 60, 110, 45 and
120, we get figures of 600,000, 1,100,000, 450,000 and 1,200,000
which are more or less the totals of deaths suffered by each
combatant power at the moment its army underwent collapse
or crisis. The German army, which certainly suffered a great
many more deaths before cracking, escapes from the pattern;
but it is important to recall that, almost until the end of the
war, it had been fed on a diet of victory: in 19I4, Tannenberg,
in 1916 Gorlice-Tarn6w, in 1916 the defeat of Rumania, in
<b>(p.272)</b>
I9I 7 Caporetto and the Russian armistice, in I9I8 a succession
of breakthroughs of the British and French fronts.
Broad views of this sort tell us nothing, however, about
what did (or did not) motivate the soldier to fight in a specific
combat situation in trench warfare. We have seen that on the
Somme, on July 1st, there were special factors at work which
were implicit in the composition and experience- or inexperience-
of the Fourth Army. But over and above its cohesion,
sense of mission, mood of self-sacrifice, local as well as national
patriotism, there were other elements in play. Self-confidence
and credulity were certainly present, and powerfully effective
at persuading the Pals to jump the parapet. But to emphasize
the populist character of the Kitchener armies is to minimize
the importance which leadership played in taking it into battle.
And arguments can be found to suggest that leadership conscious,
principled, exemplary- was of higher quality and
greater military significance in the First World War, at least
in the British army, than before or since. <br>
<br>
The ‘Lost Generation’ and the ‘Public School Officer’ are
clichés which seem too well-worn to be worth repeating or reexamining
in this context. Certainly by the end of the war, the
officers of the British Expeditionary Force had ceased to be a
socially exclusive group, indeed were perhaps more broadly
recruited than their equivalents in the Second World War.
For the British army of I 939-45 put officer selection on to a
scientific basis, making all applicants for commissions submit
to tests of their intelligence, stability, companionability, leadership
potential and the like, considerations which favoured the
middle-class over the working-class candidate. The officer
casualty rate of the First World War would have made such a
system unworkable, even if it had been thought of, and as the
campaign on the Western Front dragged on it became the
practice to promote direct from the ranks on a commanding
officer’s recommendation. Thus men whose only qualification
for a commission was that they had proved themselves good
soldiers, and who would in peacetime have had no chance, or
thought, of becoming officers, found themselves suddenly
lieutenants, later captains, majors, or even lieutenant-colonels.
In the longer term, this wholesale conferment of officer-status
(avoided in the German army by recourse to such expedients
<b>(p.273)</b>
as the creation of ‘deputy officers’ and ‘sergeant-major-lieutenants’)
on lower-middle and upper working-class youth was to
have a highly beneficial effect on the English class-system. The
immediate difficulty remained, nevertheless, and it was one which
each new officer had to face, of finding and adopting a personal
style to match the rank which chance had thrust upon him. <br>
<br>
The demeanor of the regular officer ought to have provided
the temporary (‘temporary gentleman’ was the unkind wartime
gibe) with an ideal type. But the regular officers disliked serving
in the Kitchener battalions. (‘The inspection proceeded. The
General found that many of the men came out in August I 9 I 4·
He was at home with these- he had just come from inspecting
the 2oth Royal Fusiliers [a Kitchen battalion]. He chatted
and chaffed, pinched their arms and ears, asked how many
children they had, and if they could be doing with leave to
get another. As he passed from one 1914 man to another he
dug his elbows into the Commanding Officer’s ribs and
exclaimed, “You’re a lucky fellow.” When it was over he said
. .. “That’s been a treat. That’s the sort we’ve known for thirty
years.”’*) Most Kitchener battalions knew as regular officers
only the colonel and the adjutant. What served to ensure, in
the remarkable way that happened, that new officers should
resemble old was the decision to choose the first temporary
officers, as R. C. Sherriff recalls from painful experience, from
among public schoolboys, at a time when the regular British
officer was a public school rather than a distinctively military
type. This threatens to be a tautology, for the critics of the pre-
1914 public schools commonly condemned them as militaristic.
In a sense they were. But unlike the German military schools,
which segregated the future officer from childhood and brought
him up in a strictly military regime, the public schools educated
the whole English upper-middle class and exposed it to a variety
of influences, athletic, scholastic, ethical and religious as well
as military. The eighteen-year-old who went on to the Royal
Military College was treated when he arrived there as someone
already formed in character and attitude and only needing
tactical training to take his place in his regiment.<br>
<br>
Thus it was that the amateur officers of the New Armies
<b>(p.274)</b>
knew from the outset what was expected of them. And they
knew too into what sort of institution the embryo regiment
they had joined should grow. For the British regiment, with its
complex and highly individual accretion of traditions, local
affinities, annual rituals, inter-company rivalries, fierce autonomy
and distinctive name- King’s Shropshire Light Infantry,
Loyal North Lancashire, Duke of Wellington’s, Royal Fusiliers
-was an extension, indeed a creation of the Victorian public
school system. Simply by being themselves, therefore, the first
amateur officers provided their untrained soldiers both with an
environment and a type of leadership almost identical to those
found in a regular, peacetime regiment. They organized games
for the men, and took part themselves, because that was the
public school recipe for usefully occupying young males in their
spare time. They organized competitions between platoons and
companies- in cross-country running, rifle shooting, trench
digging- because competition was the dynamic of public
school life. They saw to the men’s food, health, cleanliness,
because as seniors they had been taught to do the same for
junior boys. They administered automatically the military
code of rewards and punishments, because it mirrored the
system in which they had been brought up. And they took their
men to church because it was there on Sundays that the school
went en masse. <br>
<br>
It is important not to exaggerate the piety of the public
school officer of the New Armies. Some, like the most famous of
them, Rupert Brooke, had become intellectual agnostics at
the university. Some were indifferent or non-committal in a way
which would have made them instantly at home in Wellington’s
army. Graham Greenwell, an eighteen-year-old Wykehamist
whose diary is an important corrective to some ‘Lost Generation’
myths, seems to have lived a healthily pagan life for four
years, sharing with Julian Grenfell, a regular officer, the view
that, in the latter’s words, ‘War ... is like a big picnic without
the objectlessness of a picnic,’ before which he had ‘never been
so well or so happy’. Grenfell was unlike Greenwell, however,
in seeming actually to enjoy killing Germans, for which he had
had a special sniping rifle made. Many of the amateur officers,
and some of the regulars, in the early stages at least, shrank
from killing. Greenwell describes the look-out he kept for the
<b>(p.275)</b>
rare sight of a German and how, when at last he saw one within
sniping range, he handed his rifle to a sergeant to do the deed.
Hanbury-Sparrow, a regular officer, is more specific about his
conscientious objection: ‘You neither want to be killed nor to
kill anybody. Officers, you feel, shouldn’t engage in the roughand-
tumble- that’s for the men; [yours] is the thinking
part.’ His objection is not therefore strictly ethical; but he
did take an elevated view of what qualities an officer should
possess:
<br>
<blockquote> Were they or were they not braver? That was your
criterion ... For the act of being brave compelled the
utilisation of the whole reserve of moral force that lay
in a man ... every battalion had its own little core of
officers around which the battalion clung. Wounds or
sickness might get them but sure enough they’d return
... Revolving around this nucleus was an endless changeover
of officers. Death claimed many, but of the survivors
only the good gravitated towards the centre. The rest ...
couldn’t stick it, and amongst them almost invariably
were the hard drinkers and persistent womanisers- the
very men, in fact, whose conduct showed their lack
of inner discipline. Here in the trenches your sins found
you out. </blockquote>
<br>
This equation of courage with morality, a sort of heroic Puritanism,
is distinctive of the public school approach to the First
World War, at least in the early stages - though Sparrow was
not an orthodox Christian but a disciple of Rudolf Steiner. A
Christian who articulated the approach in words which
appeared to express the feelings of many New Army officers
was Donald Hankey, killed on the Somme in October 1916.
The essays in which he had spoken for his generation were
written for the Spectator over the signature ‘A Student in Arms’.
Perhaps the most significant of them for the modern reader is
‘The Beloved Captain’, in which he characterizes the ideal
leader.
<br>
<blockquote> 
He came in the early days ... tall, erect, smiling ... For
a few days he just watched. Then he started work. He
picked out some of the most awkward ones and ... marched</blockquote>
<br>
<b>(p.236)</b>

<br>
<blockquote> them away by themselves ... His confidence was infectious
. . . His simplicity could not fail to be understood ... very
soon the awkward squad found themselves awkward no
longer ... The fact was that he had won his way into our
affections. We loved him . . . If anyone had a sore foot he
would kneel down . . . and look at it . . . If a blister had to
be lanced, he would very likely lance it himself ... There
was something almost religious about this care for our
feet. It seemed to have a touch of the Christ about it. </blockquote>
<br>
The point to which Hankey leads the reader, via a catalogue
of the complete officer’s virtues, but with more art than these
extracts convey, is the revelation of the beloved captain as
Christ himself. ‘We knew that we should lose him ... But how
was the company to get on without him? To see him was to
forget our personal anxieties and only to think of ... the regiment
and honour.’ He is killed. ‘But he lives ... And we
who knew him do not forget. [And] I think that those who went
West have seen him. When they got to the other side I think
they were met . . . And as they knelt before that gracious
pierced Figure, I reckon they saw nearby the Captain’s smile.
Anyway, in that faith let me die, if death should come to
me.’<br>
<br>
It seems unlikely that many officers would have admitted to
sharing in its entirety Hankey’s view of what an officer should
be. Nevertheless, it appears to indicate the direction, at the
beginning of the war, of their aspirations and, if that is so, it
eases our understanding of why the thousands of the New
Armies climbed so readily into no-man’s-land on July 1st and
trudged off behind their platoon leaders. But why, once there,
they continued to advance and to contest ground with the
enemy demands a different explanation, for, amid the conditions
of the First World War battlefield, leadership of the close order
variety exercised at Waterloo was not possible. The men
were deployed in ‘extended order’, so that many were too far
from the officer to be under his physical control- no question
of pushing or thumping the ranks into line on the Somme while
the noise level, higher still than at Waterloo, drowned the
human voice at a few feet. <br>
<br>
The hope of plunder as a motive may be discounted. Soldiers
<b>(p.277)</b>
of 1914-18 could leave their money as credits with the paymaster,
while trinkets had declined in relative value, so that
there was little for which life was worth risking to be found
across no-man’s-land. Compulsion, on the other hand, was as
important an agent in impelling men into the fight as ever.
Crozier describes dealing with some runaways of his battalion
on the afternoon of the Ulster Division’s fight for the Schwaben
Redoubt:
<br>
<blockquote> a strong rabble of tired, hungry and thirsty stragglers
approach me from the east ... ‘Where are you going?’
I ask. One says this, one another. They are ... given a
drink and hunted back to the fight. Another more formidable
party cut across ... They are damned if they are
going to stay ... A young sprinting subaltern heads them
off. They push by him. He draws his revolver . . . They
take no notice. He fires. Down drops a British soldier at
his feet. The effect is instantaneous. They turn back .... </blockquote>
<br>
Moreover each battalion told off men to act as ‘battle police’ -
in Queen Victoria’s Rifles their duties were ‘to see that no
stragglers are left in the trenches’ and to send ‘any so found ...
up to their companies’ -and the topography of the First World
War battlefield made the task of the battle police comparatively
simple. For men anxious to avoid death would naturally seek
to remain in the trench system which, like school corridors,
were easily patrolled for truants. <br>
<br>
Compulsion, however, is not the whole, nor even part of the
answer. That is best sought, perhaps, by looking at what it was
that impelled the defenders, in this case the Germans, to fight.
On their motivation the topography of the battlefield would
also have exerted a powerful influence. For, as the British plan
emphasized, and the Germans knew without being told,
possession of the parapet of their front-line trench was to be
decisive in determining who lived and who died (not that the
plan put it like that). Should the British reach it first, they
could kill the defenders, at no risk to themselves, by throwing
grenades down the shafts of the dug-outs. The Germans,
might of course, dissuade them by offering their surrender.
But, questions of honour and fighting spirit apart, surrendering
was a ticklish business in trench warfare. Prisoners had no
<b>(p.278)</b>
inherent value, so that soldiers did not seek specially to take
them. The onus fell rather on the would-be prisoner to get his
surrender accepted, something difficult to do when friend and
enemy met so rarely face-to-face, when face-to-face encounters
tended to provoke hair-trigger reactions, and when a pacific
shout from a dark dug-out in a foreign language might be
misinterpreted. Even if taken prisoner, the captive’s safety was
not assured. For prudence required that he be sent instantly
across no-man’s-land, where he risked stumbling into his own
artillery’s barrage, or being mistaken for an attacker by
infantry of the second wave waiting in the opposite front line.
Both these fates overtook German prisoners on July 1st. About
eighty out of three hundred unwounded Germans being sent
back to the trenches of the 56th London Division opposite
Gommecourt were killed at 9.30 a. m. by German shelling;
later Crozier, commanding the 9th Royal Irish Rifles, realized
that his reserves in the front line were firing at prisoners whom
some of his wounded were escorting from the far side. At his
command, they stopped, but reluctantly. ‘“After all,” I heard
a youngster say, “they are only Germans.’”<br>
<br>
It does not take very much more illustration than these
instances provide to explain why it was that the Germans
raked so ferociously the advancing British lines at zero hour on
July 1st. There was, in a sense, nothing personal about it. To
surrender was dishonourable and might be dangerous. To run
away was impossible (for the Germans, of course, had their
own battle police farther down the trenches). To kill the British
was, therefore, a necessity- though the majority would have
called it a duty and, to the British on the wrong side of the
wire, it may have seemed that they found it a pleasure. Certainly,
as we have seen, easy killing does seem to generate in
human beings symptoms of pleasure, which the zoologist Hans
Kruuk has tried to relate to the compulsive behaviour of
certain predatory animals when they come upon groups of their
prey which are unable to escape from them. There was, however,
probably no vindictiveness in the shots which Germans,
in many places, later aimed at the British wounded, lying outside
their trenches, whenever they moved. The Germans,
recently released from the imprisonment of a terrible bombardment,
outnumbered, and just reprieved from the sentence of
<b>(p.279)</b>
execution by grenade-blast below ground, were tensed to shoot
at anyone who by as much as a gesture threatened to renew the
attack on their positions. <br>
<br>
If this helps to explain the German ‘will to combat’, it helps
to explain too what motivated the British to dispute with them
possession of the front trench. But does it explain what prompted
the infantry who got in to leave its shelter and press on to their
next objective? Excitement, sense of duty, knowledge of the
plan, previous rehearsal of their task would all have been a
spur; so too would have been the re-imposition of leadership
which possession of the trench made possible; many accounts
describe how the officers moved along a captured trench to
speak to their men, sort out disorganization, encourage,
congratulate, exhort. But again, as with the Germans, mechanical
and topographical factors were at work. An enemy front
trench was a dangerous place; its defences were the wrong way
round and it had no-man’s-land, an area of intense hazard,
behind it. To be counter-attacked in the front trench was to risk
expulsion into the danger-zone one had just escaped -the
enemy barrage-line or the killing area of his machine-guns.
Safer, in many ways, to press on, particularly if one’s own
barrage, that explosive safety curtain, was still within reach
and offered one safe passage to the next enemy trench. To
reach that was to provide oneself with room to manreuvre to
one’s rear, if events should subsequently force one to retreat;
it was also to vacate a space for the supporting waves to
occupy, which would come to one’s assistance if the enemy
should counter-attack. For how long such a comparatively
complex set of perceptions would impel infantry to move
forward into enemy territory is very difficult to estimate. These
are really officers’ perceptions. But the precariousness of life
in the enemy’s front trench would have been evident to most
soldiers; once persuaded to move forward from it, it seems to
have been possible to keep them on the go until enemy resistance
or the onset of exhaustion forced them to ground. What
happened then would have been determined by the rules of
trench warfare examined earlier.
<b>(p.280)</b>

<center><b><i> Commemoration </i></b></center><br>
<br>
July 1st was not the end of the Battle of the Somme. The attack
was to be renewed several times during the summer autumn
and early winter, and only officially to be closed down on
November 18th. The official history of the war names eight
‘phases’ of the battle after July 1st; the first phase was officially
designated after the war, by the Battle Nomenclature Committee,
the Battle of Albert (from a little town behind the front),
a name now used by no one. <br>
<br>
By the time the battle ended, 4I9,654 British soldiers had
become casualties on the Somme, and nearly two hundred
thousand French. The exact number of German casualties
has been debated ever since, the official historians seeking to
show that they exceeded those of the Allies, their opponents the
contrary. <br>
<br>
But. the Battle of the Somme has, in a sense, not ended yet.
The Villages and towns of the battlefield had all been rebuilt
in an unpleasing red brick, by the middle I 920s. By then, too:
the majority of the bodies of Allied soldiers killed on the Somme
had been disinterred from their hasty graves and reburied the
British in fifty of the beautiful garden cemeteries which the
Imperial War Graves Commission has created in every country 
in which Britain has had soldiers killed since 1914. But the
principal memorial which the Somme left to the British nation
is not one of headstones and inscriptions. It is intellectual and
literary, and it turns on the revelation, from which the British
had hitherto been shielded by their navy, that war could
threaten with death the young manhood of a whole nation.
This realization was to have important political after-effects
during the Second World War: ‘On one occasion when [the
American] General Marshall was in England, pouring forth
the most cogent and. logical arguments in favour of a prompt
invasion of the Continent ... Lord Cherwell remarked to him
“It’s no use- you are arguing against the casualties on the
Somme.”’ The same realization was to colour British strategic
thinking, both official and academic, about what sort of wars
she should fight. For the cause of the defeat on the first day of
<b>(p.281)</b>
the Somme needed no analysis: anyone could understand
that when a near majority of the soldiers committed to an
attack are killed or wounded in its opening moments, the
remainder will be too shocked and disoriented to continue.<br>
<br>
These impressions might, nevertheless, have faded, had it not
been that the experience of the Western Front, of which the
Somme marked the opening of the crucial phase, called forth
from the generation which underwent it a literature of immense
imaginative sweep and power. Much of it was poetic in form,
and it was the poetry which was published soonest, a great deal
of it while the war was in progress. Precisely because this
earliest outpouring of protest was poetry, a literary form which
hid from its audience its documentary value, its effect was
transitory; or rather, it was to require for a prolongation of its
effect some form of verification in prose, some confirmation
in ordinary language that what Sassoon, Graves, Blunden had
had to say was not private and subjective but an expression of
the feelings of a whole generation. ‘A whole generation’ of
course goes too far, including many without the educational
or emotional equipment to see or feel as the poets saw and felt,
and including too a considerable number, as well-educated and
sentient as they, who either tolerated the war or actually
enjoyed it. But a silent majority of the war-generation probably
perceived in their verse a truthfulness to which they could
assent. And ten years after the war, in the period 1928-32,
the endorsement in prose, of the poets’ cry from the trenches,
suddenly found expression and an audience. Remarque’s All
Quiet on the Western Front, Blunden’s Undertones of War and
Graves’ Goodbye to All That were published in 1928, Aldington’s
Death of a Hero and Hemingway’s Farewell to Arms in I929,
Sassoon’s Memoirs of an Infantry Officer in 1930-autobiographical
or fictional-documentary accounts of the war on the German,
British and Italian fronts, four by writers who had already
acquired reputations as leading ‘war poets’. <br>
<br>
Writers are as quick as anyone, quicker sometimes than
publishers, to detect the drift of the literary market. One should
be cautious, therefore, in interpreting the sudden outpouring
of war literature at the end of the nineteen-twenties in the
language of psychology- the ‘lifting of a collective amnesia’
or the ‘dissipation of a mass repression’. All great wars of modern
<b>(p.282)</b>
times have evoked a literary response, but always at a certain
remove from the termination of hostilities themselves. Bloem,
whose Vormarsch is one of the disregarded classics of the First
World War, had made his literary reputation in Germany
before 1914 with a series of novels about the Franco-Prussian
War in which he had been too young to take part; Crane, in
America, had done the same for the Civil War with The Red
Badge of Courage. Both had recognized a new public’s readiness
to listen to what they had to say; in capturing its attention,
they attracted a crowd of imitators to the same theme. <br>
<br>
But if the outpouring of war books in 1928-32 had been a
mere exercise in literary share-pushing, one would not have
expected much, if any, of what was published to sustain a
readership; one good book and a cluster of mediocre imitations
would be all that a modern critic might realistically look to turn
up on re-examination. That, of course, is not the case. Remarque’s
work is a little cloying to present-day taste, Aiding-
<b>(p.283)</b>
ton’s has a bitterness which seems exaggerated. But Blunden’s,
Graves’s, Hemingway’s and Sassoon’s have not only stood up
well to the passage of time; everything about them suggests
that they will continue to be read, not as background material
for an understanding of the Great War, or as documentary
evidence, but as moving and enduring expressions of truth
about how man confronts the inevitability of death. <br>
<br>
It is the eternal quality contained in the best literature of
the First World War (the quality of much of the secondary
authors’ writing is also admirable) that invests the experience
of the Somme with the importance it continues to hold. Nothing
which the Second World War evoked stands comparison
with it (though a few unfairly overlooked novels of remarkable
depth have been published: in England David Holloway’s
Flesh Wounds, in America James Jones’s The Thin Red Line).
Indeed, the only important category of book which the Second
World War established in England was the prisoner-of-war
story. Its extraordinary vogue prompts one to speculate about
what channels non-combatant perceptions of war move
through. If one takes it as axiomatic that the public’s interest
is in what happened at the point of maximum danger, then the
success of the literature of trench life is instantly understandable.
Does the public’s obsession with what went on behind the
barbed wire of Stalagluft Ill or Colditz imply some unconscious
recognition that it was to be in a camp- concentration
camp, extermination camp, labour camp, prisoner-of-war
camp; the differentiation blurs easily- to have been the
enemy’s chattel, not his opponent, that was really dangerous in
the Second World War, and that to have been a fighting soldier
was to have lived in relative safety? Or was it rather that the
public had recognized that from the literature of the First
World War, from the story of the Somme, it had learnt as much
as it ever would about what modern war could do to men, and
perceived that some limit of what human beings could and
could not stand on the battlefield had at last been reached;
that none of the refinements of military technique or perfection
of weapons achieved by science since 1918 had effectively
worsened the predicament of the individual who found himself
in the killing zone; and that the voice from the trenches spoke
for every soldier of the industrial age? If so, Sassoon’s, Graves’s,

Blunden’s readership had perceived an important slice of
reality.*

• This book was completed before the publication of Paul Fussell’s
The Great War and Modem Memory (Oxford University Press, 1975), which
is wholly and illuminatingly devoted to ‘the British experience on the
Western Front ... and some of the literary means by which it has been
remembered, conventionalized and mythologized’.
