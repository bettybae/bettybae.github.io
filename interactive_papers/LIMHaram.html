	<p><b> Barefoot Gen </b>

<p>
[Narration] Wheat pushes its shoots up through the winter frost, only to be stepped on again and again. The trampled wheat sends strong roots into the earth, endures frost, wind and snow grows straight and tall … and one day bears fruit.
</p>

<p>
[Song] Oh, it's 5:30 in the morning. Daddy walks out the door with his lunchbox full of cheap noodles ... Yes, it's a hard life for poor folks ... Day in, day out the fleas keep biting.... 
</p>

<p>
Gen: Hey Eiko, our wheat s grown real tall already! We can eat bread soon!
Ha-ha! Akira can't have any. Cause he's going away to the country with the group evacuation!

Gen: You're lucky, Akira! Out in the country you get to eat stuff like persimmons and chestnuts ... I wish I could too!

Mother: Don't be silly. It's wartime, there's no food in the countryside either.

Gen: Rats! I'd like to have a whole bowl of rice, just once! Huh, Shinji!
</p>
…
<p>
[Air raid warning starts]
Mother: Gen! Stop that! You come into the shelter right now! Don't you remember that girl down the street who got killed by machine gun fire just three days ago?! Come inside!

Mr. Nakaoka: The Americans are attacking in broad daylight now. Japan will lose the war for sure. It's ridiculous! Japan's going to lose! What's the point of all these drills?

Mother: The neighbors already have their eye on you because you’re always criticizing the war.
</p>
…
<p>
[At the spear drill session]
Police: For the victory of the Great Japanese Empire, we here on the home front must be as steadfast as the soldiers on the front lines! In anticipation of the final battle on our mainland against the American and British devils, we will now commence spear drill! Now then! Mr. Onishi here, who killed 38 Russian soldiers in the Russo-Japanese war, will show us how to defeat the enemy with a spear.... 

Crowd: Yeah, anybody who killed 40 soldiers must know what he's doing!

Mr. Onishi: [demonstrates]…Otherwise, when the flesh stiffens, you won't be able to remove the spear ...Got that? All right, men, go to it! Spear the American and British devils!!

Mr. Nakaoka [Farts]

Police: Y-you're not serious about this! How dare you come drunk to this drill?! You’re farting because you lack self-discipline! How can you defeat the Americans with that attitude?! Nakaoka, control yourself! We are all striving for the victory of Japan ... Your conduct is a disgrace to the empire!!

Mr. Nakaoka: [thinks] who could put up with this nonsense sober? [Says] Shut up! I won't be called a traitor just because I farted! You think we can fight the Americans with bamboo sticks?! America has more resources than Japan does. A small country like Japan can only survive by foreign trade. We should keep peace with the rest of the world. You'll see how stupid this war is soon enough. Try thinking for yourselves for a change!
</p>
…

<p>
[Akria departs] Mother: War ... it's so sad. Parents and children forced to live apart ...I don't care how poor we are, I'd be happy if we could all just live together.
</p>
…
<p>
Gen: Mama, I’m starving!

Mother: Be patient. Nobody can buy rice these days, even if they've got the money. We have to do without so the soldiers can eat rice and win the war for us.

Gen: All we get every day is watery gruel... You can count the grains of rice in it

Mr. Nakaoka: Damn! If only peace would come ... If it weren't for the war, we wouldn't have to live like this. For poor people like us, war doesn't do one damn bit of good… 

[Air raid alarms] 
Forget it. If they bomb us, hiding in a shelter won't do us any good. I'm tired of running around.
</p>

<p>
[Students bully Gen and Eiko]
Eiko: W-what do you think you're doing?!

Chairman’s son: Shut up! Your father's a bad man. He's against the war, a disgrace to our neighborhood, a COWARD!

Children: Hey, you traitors! We're gonna to straighten you traitors out!

Gen: D-damn ... They make fun of us and call us traitors, all because Papa's against the war...
Stupid Papa! Stupid Papa!

Eiko: What your Papa says is right. He's no traitor! It takes a lot of courage to believe in peace and oppose the war. You should be proud of him. 
</p>
…
<p>
Police: [Police arrests Mr. Nakaoka] you’re to be questioned. I'm taking you down to the police station. He won't be returning for quite a while. Bring his belongings to the station later. •

Gen, Shinji and Eiko: Hey! Why're you taking Papa away!! Officer, why are you taking him away? ... Tell us!
</p>
…
<p>
Chairman: Those Nakaokas are all troublemakers. That'll teach them a lesson for biting your fingers off, Ryukichi!
</p>
…
<p>
Police: [torturing Mr. Nakaoka] When a hundred million Japanese citizens are giving their all for victory ... Who do you think you are, opposing the war?!

Mr. Nakaoka: It's because I love Japan that I'm against the war.

Police: Aren't you ashamed of yourself as a Japanese? 

Mr. Nakaoka: I -I've already cooperated enough with the War effort ... My eldest son, Koji, has given up his studies to work in a factory, making weapons... There are.no metal pots and … no pans left in our house ... They were all taken. Away to make what? Because the military warships, tanks and guns. My children hungry every day ... They fight over one potato, one grain of rice…

Police: Shut up! That's all a matter of course for a Japanese!

Mr. Nakaoka: How can poor people like us cooperate any more than this?! The lives of six people my family, depend on me. I can't afford to take time off for spear drill. I have to work to keep my children from starving to death. 

Police: It's not just you! Everyone is suffering! Things will get better when we win! You traitorous subversive! Your thoughts are dangerous. I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget!

Mr. Nakaoka: Has this nation ever helped the suffering? Poor? War brings us nothing but misery. Japan has to walk the path of peace, not war. That’s what I believe.

Police: You're a wretched excuse for a Japanese! You should beg the Emperor's forgiveness!
Shame on you!!
</p>
…
<p>
Mr. Dobashi: Say, the police are giving that Nakaoka a hard time these days, aren't they?

Chairman: Serves him right! Traitors like him have to be given the works! That whole family's rotten! Biting my son's fingers off ... I told the police to teach 'em a lesson! I've been wanting the police to investigate Nakaoka for a long time. People like him are a disgrace to the Japanese Empire!
</p>

<p>
[Song]We left our homeland ... Swearing to return victorious...
</p>
…
<p>
Mother: I'm sorry to trouble you again, Mrs. Sumida ... but could I borrow a bit of rice and miso?

Mrs. Sumida: Think nothing of it! In hard times like these, friends should help each other out!

Mr. Sumida: Fool! If we have anything to do with them, the whole town will turn against us too. They're traitors. The neighborhood Chairman said not to deal with them.

Mrs. Sumida: I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Nakaoka, but we've run out of rice and Miso… 

Mother: Even her… and we were such good friends ... Sob ... All because my husband opposes the war...
</p>

<p>
[School]
Gen’s teacher: The Emperor is the god of Japan. You are all the Emperor's children. Japan is a sacred country. The wind of the gods will blow away any enemies that come near. You've all written letters to send to our soldiers in far off battlefields. Let’s hear yours, Yamada

Yamada: Dear soldiers, I hope you are well. When I grow up, I will become a soldier too and kill lots of horrible American soldiers. Keep up the good work.

Other student: We will do all we can to help you win this war, however hard things are. We will die anytime for the Emperor and our country.

Gen: My father says that Japan must not go to war. He also says that wars deprive people of their lives and destroy everything ... I agree with him.

Teacher: [hits Gen] Idiot! You dare call yourself a Japanese boy?! ,

Gen: Oww ... You told me to write what I thought, didn't you?

Teacher: Fool! Don't you ever write that war is bad again, or you' II be sorry! As a child of the Emperor, you should be ashamed of yourself! Now write it over again, and ask the soldiers to kill lots of American and British devils. Y -you disgusting little coward ... You're a disgrace to this class! What do you think of Nakaoka?

Yamada: Sir! Nakaoka is a bad one!

Other student: People against the war should be punished.

Teacher: Exactly! We can't allow bad thoughts like Nakaoka's!

Gen: Why am I wrong?
</p>
... 
<p>
Eiko: [stripped] But my teacher won't believe me. There's money missing from our classroom, and the teacher says I stole it... 

Gen: ... So they stripped you and searched you?

Eiko: Mr. Numata, however much you search me, you won't find the money because I didn't take it!

Gen: My sister never lies, Mr. Numata! Stop bullying her!

Mr. Numata: Your father's an antiwar traitor who's in police custody. He's probably a thief, too.

Eiko: So you refuse to believe I didn't steal it? 

Mr. Numata: When the parent's a traitor, the children can't amount to any good
</p>
…
<p>
Shinji: Hey, what do American soldiers eat, Gen? White rice?

Gen: Nah, American soldiers are devils, they probably eat shit!
</p>
…
<p>
[Mr. Nakaoka Returns]
Mr. Nakaoka: Idiot! Don't you ever make fun of Koreans! That the Japanese are superior, and the Koreans and Chinese are stupid and useless … Nowadays, the military dictatorship controls everything -- schools, newspapers, radio, the police... They're all lying to you. The only way to prevent war is to be friends with other people like the Koreans and Chinese. Whenever the military grabs political power, the world becomes a dark, terrifying place.
The Japanese are doing terrible things in the name of the war. That makes me ashamed to be Japanese. Oh, we mustn't be mean to Koreans. It's the people at the top, the ones who started the war, who spread the idea ... They tell us that people in other countries are worthless, that they're demons... It's all to make us believe that Japan will win the war because the enemy's so weak!
</p>
…

<p>
Gen: Uh, Mr. Pak, about the other day when I said I hated you 'cause they were teasing me for being with a Korean ... I shouldn't have said those things ... I'm sorry!

Mr. Pak: He’s a good kid. If only all the Japanese were like him...
</p>
…

<p>
[Koji returns, says he wants to join the Navy]

Mr. Nakaoka: Koji, why do you want to join the Navy?

Koji: I'll join the Navy and smash those dirty Yankees and Limies!

Mr. Nakaoka: You remember your cousin Gokichi? He joined the Navy, and you know what he looked like when he came back? He lost his sight, his arms and legs were torn off. All he could do was breathe. He looked like some kind an insect.

Koji: But his neighbors all praised him as a war hero.

Mr. Nakaoka: Easy for them to say...

Koji: I'm joining the Navy. I don't care if I die! If I can die for my country, for all Japanese people, then I'll be satisfied!

Mr. Nakaoka: What do you mean, "For my country"? They went to war to line their pockets!
Wake up, Koji!! Y-you really think this war is being fought for all Japanese people?
You want to die for a few rich people? Your life's worth more than that!! A handful of rich men started this war! They didn't consult us! I'm not going to make my eldest son killed! That idiot! Does he really think it takes courage to go to war?! What takes real courage is to value life -- your own and everybody's!

Koji: I don't want to be a coward and an outcast!
</p>

<p>
Gen: Koji, why're you joining the Navy? You know Papa hates the war.

Koji: I have to go ... for my sake, and for Papa and all of you! Do you know how they treat me at the factory because Papa speaks out against the war...?
</p>

<p>
[In retrospect]
Officer: Koji Nakaoka, a man from the Special Police is here to see you.

Special Police: You know an explosion occurred in this factory. That was YOUR doing, wasn't your father an anti-war traitor? Like father, like son....

Crowd: Hey, did you hear that? Nakaoka caused the explosion! You tried to sabotage this factory’s weapons production, didn't you! That rat. And when our soldiers need all the, weapons we can make for them ...I'm ashamed to think our school produced a traitorous student like you.

Special Police: Come on, Nakaoka, it'll be a lot easier for you if you confess! Now, Nakaoka. Who ordered you to set off that explosion?

Koji: Groan ... I don't know what I don't know. Groan ...It wasn't me! I didn't do it…!
</p>

<p>
Koji: So he went on beating me and demanding I confess ...They just assumed I was a criminal! I can't stand it! 

Gen: You too, huh, Koji? 

Koji: Gen! Shinji! I'll go to war and kill those American and British bastards! I'll kill 'em all!
Those dirty Special Police! Later they found out the explosion was caused by a short circuit. Once they found out about Pa, even my best friends gave me thecold shoulder. Everyday has been hell. I’m going to join the Navy and show them I’m no traitor! You’ll see! I'll come back covered with medals, so you canal walk around town with your heads high!
</p>

<p>
[Soldiers singing]: We left our homeland, swearing return victorious ...How can I without gaining honoring cattle? 
</p>

<p>
Crowd: Look everybody, the traitor's brats are here! You aren't fit to be in the presence of a fine young man

Gen: Don't you dare call us traitors anymore! You little fools! SHUT UP!!My big brother is about to volunteer for the Navy! He's going to war!

Crowd: It's the natural duty of a Japanese to go to war. Stop bragging about it! You should be ashamed to be here at all. Go home, you little traitors!

Chairman’s son: L-let's go. When those brats bite, they don't let go till they've chewed off your fingers!

Koji: Gen, I'm going to go volunteer now. If I die, you must look after our family.

Gen: Sob ... I can't stand it anymore! Being bullied and called a traitor…
</p>
<p>
Mr. Nakaoka: So Koji volunteered for the Navy for the sake of our family, because I'm called a traitor ...Dear, I guess we have no choice out to cooperate with the war effort. No matter how wrong we think it is. It's despicable ...the way the authorities use their power to force people to deceiving. Turning into human bullets ...go to war! 

Mrs. Nakaoka: Dear, if Koji joins the Navy, people will treat us more kindly. And he may even come back safe and sound. Please, let's forgive him. 

Mr. Nakaoka: You're a bloody fool, Koji! You hear me?!Kojiii! Don't die! Whatever happens, don't die. Let yourself be called a coward a weakling! Just come back alive!!You turned my son from a human being into a killing machine ... I know how you feel. But if the police arrest you again, they'll be even harder on you than last time. What will become of us?! Stop it!! Stop this damn war!! Sob ... Please, stop this damn war...
