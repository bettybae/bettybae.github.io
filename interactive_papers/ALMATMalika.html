Stalin indulged Hitler‘s expansionist policies in the west, and gave Ger. much important material aid-oil, corn and mineral products. The Nazis, however insincerely, conceded a free hand in the east to the Soviets, whose objectives included eastern Finland and the Baltic states in addition to a large share of Poland‘s carcass.” (31, from Douglas Arthur, <i>Desert Watch</i>, Blaisdon [2000], 72)<br><br>“The faith of most Germans in the virtue as well as the expediency of their mission was fortified by its swift success. The invaders closed their grip on southern Norway, having secured communications with the homeland by occupying the intervening Danish Peninsula almost with- out resistance. The Norwegian Storting met again in the little town of Elverum, forty miles north of Oslo, where its deliberations were sharpened by news that the Germans had nominated a traitor to lead a puppet regime in Oslo. "We now have a Kuusinen government," declared the prime minister contemptuously: he alluded to Finnish communist Otto Kuusinen, who collaborated with Stalin‘s invasion of Finland. But Nor- way‘s counterpart, Vidkun Quisling, would become much more notorious, his name passing into the English language.” (45, from Francois Kersaudy, <i>Norway</i>, Collins [1990], 103)<br><br>“The world watched the unfolding drama with fascination and pro- foundly confused sentiments. In America, the archisolationist Charles Lindbergh proclaimed: ‘I would a hundred times rather see my country ally herself with Britain, or even with Germany with all her faults, than the cruelty, the Godlessness and the barbarism that exist in Soviet Russia.’ Warwickshire housewife Clara Milburn found herself prey to bewilder- ment, writing on 22 June: ‘So now Russia w‘ill get a bit of what she gave Finland-and perhaps a lot more. Mr. Churchill broadcast tonight and said we must stand by Russia. 1 suppose we must, as she is now against the enemy of mankind. But 1wish we need not when I think of her ways, which are not our ways.’ On 1July a Bucharest streetcar driver, seeing Mihail Sebastian with a newspaper in his hand, asked about the German advance. ‘Have they entered Moscow?’ ‘Not yet. But they will for sure- today or tomorrow.’ ‘Well, let them. Then we can make mincemeat of the yids.’” (145, from Mihail Sebastian, <i>Journal</i>, Heinemann [2001], 374)<br><br>“Almost all British, and also later American, attempts to collaborate operationally with Stalin‘s people foundered on the rocks of their ally‘s secretiveness, incompetence, ill-will and paucity of means. The Royal Navy‘s requests for the aid of Soviet warships and aircraft to cover British convoys approaching Murmansk and Archangel yielded meager responses. In August 1942, an RAF Catalina delivered to northwest Russia two SIS agents, whom the Soviets had agreed to parachute into northern Nor- way. Their hosts instead detained the two men incommunicado for two months before dropping them, still in summer clothing, inside Finland rather than Norway, where they were swiftly arrested, tortured and shot. Thereafter, the British recognized that cooperation with the Russians was an exclusively one-way proposition; that the consequences of placing Allied personnel at the mercy of Soviet goodwill were often fatal.” (299, from Wladyslaw Anders, <i>An Army in Exile</i>, Macmillan [1949], 124)'); break;

<p> 
Volume 7. Nazi Germany, 1933-1945
Directive No. 21 Operation Barbarossa (December 18, 1940)
</p> 

<p> 
The subjugation of Poland within four weeks was the prelude to Hitler’s campaign of conquest throughout Europe. In a series of blitzkrieg offensives, German forces quickly occupied the Benelux states, Denmark, Norway, and France. Hitler’s plan for a reordering of the continent under German hegemony – a plan that envisaged the incorporation of large parts of Western Europe and some sections of Poland into the Reich – seemed to be becoming a reality. In the meantime, Stalin had begun appropriating as much Eastern European territory as he possibly could without precipitating a break with Hitler. Thus, he annexed Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in August, along with Bessarabia and parts of Finland. But while Stalin was taking advantage of this opportunity to expand his sphere of power, Hitler was preparing to crush his Russian ally. After the defeat of France and the withdrawal of British troops from the European continent, Hitler believed the time was right for a historic confrontation with the Bolshevist archenemy. On December 18, 1940, he issued “Directive No. 21 Operation Barbarossa” to the leadership of the Wehrmacht, giving the order to prepare for an offensive war against the Soviet Union the following year.
</p>

<p> 
DIRECTIVE No. 21: OPERATION BARBAROSSA
</p> 

<p>
 The German Wehrmacht must be prepared <i>to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign </i> (Operation Barbarossa) even before the conclusion of the war against England. 
For this purpose the <i> Army </i> will have to employ all available units, with the reservation that the occupied territories must be secured against surprises.
</p>

<p> 
For the <i>Luftwaffe </i> it will be a matter of releasing such strong forces for the eastern campaign in support of the Army that a quick completion of the ground operations can be counted on and that damage to eastern German territory by enemy air attacks will be as slight as possible. This concentration of the main effort in the East is limited by the requirement that the entire combat and armament area dominated by us must remain adequately protected against enemy air attacks and that the offensive operations against England, particularly against her supply lines, must not be permitted to break down.
</p>

<p>
 The main effort of the <i> Navy </i> will remain unequivocally directed against England even during an eastern campaign.
</p>

<p> 
I shall order the <i> concentration </i> against Soviet Russia possibly 8 weeks before the intended beginning of operations.
</p>

<p>
Preparations requiring more time to get under way are to be started now – if this has not yet been done – and are to be completed by May 15, 1941.
</p>

<p> 
It is of decisive importance, however, that the intention to attack does not become discernible.
</p>

<p> 
The preparations of the High Commands are to be made on the following basis:
I. <i> General Purpose: </i>
</p>

<p> 
The mass of the Russian <i> Army </i> in western Russia is to be destroyed in daring operations, by driving forward deep armored wedges, and the retreat of units capable of combat into the vastness of Russian territory is to be prevented.
</p>

<p> 
In quick pursuit a line is then to be reached from which the Russian Air Force will no longer be able to attack the territory of the German Reich. The ultimate objective of the operation is to establish a cover against Asiatic Russia from the general line Volga-Archangel. Then, in case of necessity, the Luftwaffe can eliminate the last industrial area left to Russia in the Urals.
</p>

<p> 
In the course of these operations the Russian <i>Baltic Sea Fleet </i> will quickly lose its bases and thus will no longer be able to fight.
</p>

<p> 
Effective intervention by the Russian <i>Air Force </i> is to be prevented by powerful blows at the very beginning of the operation.
</p>

<p> 
II. <i>Probable Allies and their Tasks: </i>
</p>

<p> 

1. On the wings of our operation the active participation of <i>Romania </i> and <i>Finland </i> in the war against Soviet Russia is to be expected.
</p>

<p> 
The High Command will in due time arrange and determine in what form the armed forces of the two counties will be placed under German command at the time of their intervention.
</p>

<p> 
2. It will be the task of <i>Romania </i> to support with selected forces the attack of the German southern wing, at least in its beginnings; to pin the enemy down where German forces are not committed; and otherwise to render auxiliary service in the rear area.
</p>

<p> 
3. <i>Finland </i> will cover the concentration of the German <i>North Group </i> (parts of the XXI Group) withdrawn from Norway and will operate jointly with it. Besides, Finland will be assigned the task of eliminating Hangö.
</p>

<p> 
4. It may be expected that <i>Swedish </i> railroads and highways will be available for the concentration of the German North Group, from the start of operations at the latest.
</p>

 [...]

<p> 
IV. All orders to be issued by the Commanders in Chief on the basis of this directive must clearly indicate that they are <i>precautionary measures </i> for the possibility that Russia should change her present attitude toward us. The number of officers to be assigned to the preparatory work at an early date is to be kept as small as possible; additional personnel should be briefed as late as possible and only to the extent required for the activity of each individual. Otherwise, through the discovery of our preparations – the date of their execution has not even been fixed – there is danger that most serious political and military disadvantages may arise.
