He discovered and charted some of the Aleutian Islands while he was deputy to Vitus Bering during the Great Northern Expedition. In 1721, Chirikov graduated from the Naval Academy. In 1725–1730 and 1733–1743, he was Vitus Bering’s deputy during the First and the Second Kamchatka expeditions.In <b>May 1741</b> Chirikov in the <b><i>St Paul</b></i> and Vitus Bering in the <i>St Peter</i> left Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and headed east. Some time after <b>20 June</b> they were separated by a storm and never saw each other again. On <b>15 July 1741</b> Chirikov saw land at Baker Island off Prince of Wales Island at the south end of the Alaska Panhandle. This is about 450 miles southeast of Bering’s landfall near Mount St. Elias at the north end of the panhandle. Unable to find a harbor he sailed north along Baranov Island past the later Russian base at Sitka. He sent out a longboat to find an anchorage. When it did not return after a week he sent out his second longboat which also failed to return. Now without any small boats Chirikov had no way of searching for the two longboats or landing on the coast to explore or replenish his supply of fresh water. After waiting as long as possible, he abandoned the longboats to their fate and on <b>27 July</b> sailed west. He sighted the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island and Adak Island near the western end of the Aleutians. With water critically low he reached Petropavlovsk on <b>12 October 1741</b>. In 1742, Chirikov was in charge of a search party for Bering’s ship St. Peter. During this trip, he located Attu Island. Chirikov took part in creating the final map of the Russian discoveries in the Pacific Ocean (1746). Chirikov’s name is given to Capes of the Kyūshū Island, Attu Island, Anadyr Bay, Tauyskaya Bay, an underwater mountain in the Pacific Ocean, Chirikof Island and Cape Chirikof at the westernmost point of Baker Island.'); break;

Cook made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the Seven Years’ War, and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec. This helped bring Cook to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society. This notice came at a crucial moment in both Cook’s career and the direction of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as commander of HM Bark Endeavour for the first of three Pacific voyages. In three voyages Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously achieved. As he progressed on his voyages of discovery he surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions. Cook was killed in Hawaii in a fight with Hawaiians during his <b>third exploratory voyage</b> in the Pacific in <b>1779</b>. He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge which was to influence his successors well into the 20th century and numerous memoria worldwide have been dedicated to him.'); break;

HMS <i>Resolution</i>, to be commanded by Cook, and HMS <i>Discovery</i>, commanded by Charles Clerke, were prepared for the voyage which started from Plymouth in 1776. The ships travelled to Cape Town by way of Tenerife then on to New Zealand. Omai was returned to his homeland and the ships sailed onwards, discovering the Hawaiian Archipelago, before reaching the Pacific coast of North America. The two charted the west coast of the continent and passed through the Bering Strait when they were stopped by ice from sailing either east or west. The vessels returned to the Pacific and called briefly at the Aleutians before retiring towards Hawaii for the winter. When they approached Hawaii they were met with an unexpectedly warm welcome which became tumultuous as they finally landed at Kealakekua Bay, on ‘Hawaii Island’ during the <i>Makahiki</i>, a Hawaiian harvest festival of worship for the Polynesian god Lono. After a time during which Cook, and his crew were feted, the atmosphere changed and Cook moved away from the island to continue his quest of discovery. He soon suffered damage to his ship and had to turn back. On his return, conflict arose which resulted in Cook’s death. Cook’s remains were taken away by the Hawaiians but some were returned to be buried at sea by his crew. The command of the expedition was assumed by Charles Clerke who tried in vain to find the passage before his own death. Under the command of John Gore the crews returned to a subdued London in October 1780.'); break;

It is not clear whether the vessel sailed under Portuguese colours or under the British flag with a licence from the East India Company. Hanna, who had the financial backing of John Henry Cox, a merchant residing in China, headed, for Nootka Sound (B.C.), which had been described by Captain James Cook as a likely place to acquire a profitable cargo of sea otter pelts.<br><br>Arriving there in August, Hanna and his men were attacked by the Nootka Indians, and in the ensuing struggle 20 Indians, including several chiefs, were killed. Hanna claimed that the attack occurred after he fired on the Indians in retaliation for their theft of a chisel. The Nootka chief Muquinna told Esteban José Martínez in 1789, however, that it had been in response to a humiliating and painful practical joke played on him by Hanna and his men, which involved setting off a charge of gunpowder under his chair as he sat on the deck. Whatever the cause, peaceful relations were established after the battle, and in the resulting trade Hanna acquired 560 sea otter pelts. As a token of friendship he exchanged names with Cleaskina, chief of Ahousat, a Nootka village then located on Vargas Island, who was known to later voyagers as “Captain Hanna.” Hanna returned to Macao in December, selling his furs for up to $60 apiece and realizing $20,600.<br><br>Encouraged by the profit made from such a short cruise, Hanna’s backers fitted him for a second trip. He left Macao in May 1786 in the snow Sea Otter (120 tons) with a crew of 30. When he arrived at Nootka in August, he found the situation greatly altered. James Charles Stuart Strange* of Bombay had already been there in July with two ships and had bought all the furs. Hanna remained at anchor in Nootka for a fortnight, purchasing only about 50 good pelts. He then sailed northward, discovering and naming several sounds, islands, and harbours on his way. He appears to have thought that the north end of Vancouver Island was a separate island, naming it after Cox, and he is said to have sighted the Queen Charlotte Islands, to which, with the land north of them, he gave the name Nova Hibernia. By the end of September Hanna had managed to collect about 100 prime pelts, and on 1 October he sailed for China, reaching Macao on 8 Feb. 1787. The cargo brought $8,000, despite its small size. Plans were made for a third trip, but Hanna died before they were completed.<br><br>Hanna’s visits to the northwest coast were brief, and the information he kept concerning them was scanty, but his observations were useful to others. George Dixon, John Meares*, and George Vancouver all consulted his charts.

			case 12: $("div#commentary").html('<img src="http://bettybae.ncity.net/interactive_papers/img/DauenhauersCase12SeaOtter.jpg"><br>Map of sea otter’s range<br><br><i>(“Sea Otter” from Wikipedia)</i><br><br>The sea otter (<i>Enhydra lutris</i>) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45 kg (31 and 99 lb), making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter’s primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.<br><br>The sea otter inhabits offshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.<br><br>Sea otters, whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000–300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, and the world population fell to 1,000–2,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species now occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation, although populations in the Aleutian Islands and California have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an endangered species.'); break;

	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The prelude: First encounters of Russians and Tlingits</a> </h4> <h5><i>The “fur-rush” begins, and outsiders enter the Tlingit world in search of riches</i></h5>
	
	<p>In the eighteenth century, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> people occupied the Southeast Alaska coast from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Dixon Entrance</a> to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat Bay</a>, and they were expanding into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>. They were numerous, and their villages were many. In spite of kinship links among residents of various communities, intervillage conflicts were frequent. Theirs was a warrior society with a strong <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">elite</a> – the aristocrats – providing leadership in war and peace. War and international trade were the hallmarks of relations with their neighbors. No one could have foreseen that strangers arriving from the sea in the second half of the century would change the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> world irreversibly and forever. </p>
	
	<p>In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>, we follow the series of events that became a turning point in the history of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> people: their confrontation with European invaders and the establishment of a permanent Russian presence in their territory from the end of the eighteenth century through the first two decades of the nineteenth. </p>
	
	<p>In the eighteenth century, the world of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> Indians of Southeast Alaska was being probed by outsiders - by private entrepreneurs approaching from Russia on the one hand, and from Western Europe and the Northeast United States on the other. They came from different directions and by different routes, but with the same purpose: to cash in on the newly discovered riches of the fur trade, especially sea otter pelts. </p>
	
	<p>First contact was made in 1741, when a Russian navy vessel, the St. Paul, commanded by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">Aleksei Chirikov</a>, sent a watering party ashore in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory that never returned.  Subsequent contact was sporadic, as Spain, England, and France, disturbed by Russian penetration of the North American continent, sent out naval expeditions to the North Pacific. The Spanish were the first to respond, launching expeditions in 1774 and 1775 (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">Olson 2002</a>). The English followed in 1778, when <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Captain James Cook</a>, on his <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">third expedition</a>, explored Alaska waters. The Spanish came again in 1779. The contacts were brief and restricted to a few locations, and trade was minimal, although it is probable that smallpox may have been brought by the Spanish and venereal diseases by all. </p>
	
	<p>In the few years following 1779, no Europeans came to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory, but in 1785 the first British trader, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">Captain James Hanna</a>, came to the Northwest Coast specifically to trade for furs (primarily <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">sea otters</a>) that fetched high prices in China. From this year on, merchantmen by far outnumbered any naval presence. While the Spanish sent out two more expeditions, in 1788 and 1791, and the French dispatched Comte de La Perouse, British merchantmen came every summer and grew ever more numerous some, such as George Dixon, Nathaniel Portlock, and John Meares, wintering over. Rhys Richards, biographer of Simon Metcalfe, the first Yankee skipper on the Northwest Coast, wrote, “It was no less a bonanza than a gold rush, and the race was on. Moreover it was the race that within less than a decade would lay the foundation for subsequent territorial claims to the western half of the North American continent. Meanwhile of more immediate concern, it was a race that would soon bring the two greatest maritime powers, Britain and Spain, to the brink of war” (1991:53). </p>
	
	<p>American skippers, most of them sailing from New England ports, followed Simon Metcalfe’s lead. Metcalfe, an energetic “wheeler and dealer;’ arrived on the Northwest Coast in 1788, having sailed via Madagascar, Calcutta, Macao, and Hawaii. The international trade flourished, punctuated from time to time by armed confrontations. But the strangers, who brought new and much desirable goods to Southeast Alaska, did not stay. After a summer of sailing from one location to another, collecting furs in trade with the Natives, they sailed away, and life in local communities followed the customary seasonal round. </p>
	
	<p>In the meantime, from the west, Russian traders were steadily advancing east. Beginning in 1784, large commercial companies were establishing permanent settlements in Alaska and by 1788 the first Russian merchant vessel probed deep into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory. The Russians occasionally bartered for furs, but even before they formed a permanent settlement, they preferred relatively long-term stays in the territory. From permanent outposts in the west they sent out hunting parties led by a few Russians but composed of large numbers of Native hunters, such as the Aleut of the eastern Aleutian Islands, the Alutiit  of the Kodiak Archipelago, and the Chugach of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a> and the outer Kenai Peninsula. These parties trespassed as far as the Haida territories of the Kaigani and of the Queen Charlotte Islands. By 1799, the newly formed Russian-American Company moved to establish a permanent settlement in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory, mostly to check European and American competition and to prevent any seizure of territory in the name of another state power. The Russian presence was to last until 1867, and in the end it affected the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> culture profoundly. Therefore, we discuss the Russian advance in detail. </p>
	
	<p>In the 1740s, Russian private entrepreneurs, the fur merchants, and their fur-procuring crews, began operating in the Near Islands of the Aleutian chain in westernmost Alaska. By the late 1770S, several crews were taking furs and trading with the Natives on the Alaska mainland – on the Alaska Peninsula, Bristol Bay, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>. In 1784 Grigorii Shelikhov, a successful and prosperous merchant, established, by force, a permanent post at Three Saints Bay on southwestern Kodiak Island (Black 1992a). From the beginning, Shelikhov planned to expand his activities to the Alaska mainland and along the coasts northward to Bering Strait and southward to California.</p>
	
	<p>By that time, the Russian imperial government, disturbed by the appearance in the North Pacific Ocean of heavily armed foreign (i.e., British) merchantmen, was planning to assert its sovereignty in North America. Catherine II ordered that a fleet be outfitted to sail around the world from Kronstadt in 1786, with Captain Grigorii Mulovskii in command. Mulovskii was to show the flag and claim territory as far east as Nootka (Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada). As the officially appointed, imperial government representative, he would act as de facto governor of Russian North America and establish a rule of law (which private enterprises such as the future Russian-American Company did not have the right to impose). Unfortunately, the expedition never sailed. A war with Turkey and then Sweden broke out, and the fleet was needed elsewhere (Black 1992b; Black 2004a:94-95). Thus the Russian imperial government was unable to step in. In the absence of governmental power, independent merchant activities were not curtailed, and Shelikhov was able, in 1788, to dispatch one of his vessels to reconnoiter the southeast coast of Alaska beyond <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a> into the territory of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> people. </p>
	
	<p>There is no doubt that the Russians knew of the existence of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and the Haida by hearsay prior to their expansion into Southeast Alaska. On Kodiak Island and among the Chugach, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> were considered an enemy, second only to the Aleuts of the Eastern (Fox) Islands. Kodiak historical traditions to this day contain mention of Northwest Coast raiders, and it is believed that at one point in prehistory, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> attacked and eventually conquered Kodiak Island. In 1872 an Alutiiq elder explained to the French explorer A. L. Pinart that at the time of first contact with the Russians, the leading lineages of southwest Kodiak were descendants of these invaders (Pinart MS; Black and Clark, forthcoming). </p>
	
	<p>It is also probable that the Russians encountered <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> captives held by Kodiak Islanders, the Alutiit of the upper Alaska Peninsula, or the Chugach. In 1788 the Russians found several Alutiiq and Chugach captives held in various <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> communities. In 1790, Father Vasilii Sivtsov, chaplain to the navy expedition commanded by Joseph Billings, Roman Gall (Robert Hall), and Gavriil Sarychev at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island, chrismated a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> man previously baptized by a layperson. </p>
	
	<p>Shelikhov’s 1788 expedition was commanded jointly by the experienced navigators Gerasim Izmailov and Dimitrii Bocharov. At Unalaska in 1778, Izmailov met with and gained the respect of the most famous mariner and explorer of the age, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">Captain James Cook</a> (Paseniuk 1991, 1995). Izmailov’s close friend Bocharov was also famous as a superior navigator and explorer in his own right (Khlebnikov 1835:5). Several place names in Alaska remind us of his daring forays by ship, skin boat, and kayak in Alaska waters. He died in 1793 at Unalaska.  Unfortunately, his biography has never been written.</p>
	
	<p>The navigators sailed as far southeast as Lituya Bay, and possibly even sighted Glacier Bay before turning homeward. They provided a detailed log and the first charts of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> coasts, several showing in detail important features such as <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat Bay</a> and Lituya Bay (see maps 8 and 9). The Izmailov and Bocharov log of 1788, intended for the admiralty, to be submitted via the governor-general of Siberia, ended up in the possession of Shelikhov’s company. It was published in 1793 as part 2 of the third edition of Shelikhov’s account of his 1783-86 voyage to Kodiak. An early English translation was published in 1803, and a more recent one in 1981. A new translation by Lydia Black of relevant excerpts is featured among the texts that follow in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Although our story begins here, with Shelikhov’s 1788 expedition, we must note that according to both <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and Russian tradition, the first contact took place much earlier, in 1741, when <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">Chirikov’s</a> watering party and the dory sent to look for them failed to return. One <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition states that the men deserted, joined the local fishing camp, and eventually were incorporated into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> society. “Their offspring became some of the more prominent families in the village of Klawock” says Mark Jacobs Jr. Jacobs also recounts that “the water kegs, used to replenish the fresh water supply on the ship, were a highly treasured prize, they were converted to store seal oil.” The boats were burned and the iron nails salvaged. These were the first European goods to reach the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> (Jacobs 1990:2-3, and also in section 1 of this volume; see also Black 2004a:40-41, 51). As “late-breaking news” in the ongoing mystery of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">Chirikov</a> men, we include in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a> the 2006 research by Allan Engstrom, who argues convincingly for a Surge Bay landfall at Yakobi Island, and that the shore parties capsized on the treacherous reefs and drowned.</p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The first battle encounter: Prince William Sound, June 1792</a> </h4> <h5><i>Baranov meets the Tlingits in battle, with heavy casualties on both sides</i></h5>
	
	<p>In 1790 Shelikhov engaged Aleksandr Baranov to manage his affairs in Alaska. Baranov arrived on Kodiak in 1791 and soon thereafter began to implement his employer’s plan of expansion to the mainland. In June 1792 Baranov was camping on the shore of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a> on or near Eyak territory while his subordinate, Egor Purtov, accompanied by three Russians - Osip Prianishnikov, Gavrilo Voroshilov, and Konstantin Galaktionov -- led a party of 170 baidarkas (an Aleut kayak with two hatches; see glossary for this and other terms) – 340 Alutiiq men – to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat Bay</a>. On the night of June 20, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> raiding party fell upon Baranov’s camp. Fierce fighting ensued, and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> were repelled. The next morning, Baranov braced himself for a renewed attack. However, he received reinforcements. Izmailov, commanding the Sv. Simeon Bogopriimets i Anna Prorochitsa, arrived and lent a hand. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> retreated. Baranov lost eleven men – two Russians and nine Alaskans. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> casualties were also heavy; they left behind twelve slain warriors, but carried away a large number of their wounded.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov reported on these events in a letter to Shelikhov dated July 24, 1793 written presumably at Voskresenskia Gavan’ (Resurrection Bay, modern day Seward). The letter was published in 1861-63 by P. A. Tikhmenev, official historian of the Russian-American Company, and in English translation in 1979. This letter is reproduced in full in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>. Izmailov’s log for his voyage to Cook Inlet and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a> in 1792 provides additional insight into the encounter. It is preserved in the Russian Navy Archive (RGAVMF, Fond 870, op. 1, delo 1784), but could not be reproduced here.</p>
	
	<p>A valuable and much more colorful, though second hand account, was published in 1835 by Kiril T. Khlebnikov in his biography of Baranov (1835:15-18). Khlebnikov interviewed not only Baranov himself, but other veteran promyshlenniki during his sojourn in Alaska (1818-32). An English translation of his 1835 work was published in 1973 (see especially pp. 8-9) and pertinent excerpts in a new translation are included among the texts in the present book. Despite this first battle encounter, Baranov was not deterred in carrying out his plans for expansion. His foray to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> is discussed below.</p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The first settlement in Tlingit territory: Yakutat, 1796</a> </h4><h5><i>Baranov establishes an outpost in Yakutat; it is destroyed by the Tlingits in 1805</i></h5>
	
	<p>The story of the short-lived Russian outpost at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>, intended as a springboard for launching hunting parties to Southeast Alaska, is brief, but complex, and demands separate, fuller treatment. Here we provide only a very brief synopsis in order to orient the reader. </p>
	
	<p>After the encounter in 1792, Baranov’s sea-otter hunting parties continued to visit <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat Bay</a>. In particular, Egor Purtov led a large party of Alutiiq and Chugach hunters in 1794 and presented a Russian crest to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader.  Baranov himself visited <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> in 1795 (Khlebnikov 1835:21-22, 27-29; Grinev 1991:105-6). After an initial show of force, but without any engagement in a fight, Baranov felt he had succeeded in establishing friendly relations.</p>
	
	<p>The son of a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader is said to have asked to visit the Russian establishment on Kodiak. It is possible that the father desired reliable information about the Russian settlements there, and for this purpose sent his son on a visit. To ensure his son’s safety, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader demanded hostages, and Baranov left three Alutiiq men, one Alutiiq woman (who was an interpreter, probably a former <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> captive), and nine Russians (among them probably several men of mixed Russian-Native descent). (We should note here that the term “Creole” was not yet used at this time to designate children of mixed Russian and Alaska Native parentage. In the absence of clergy, marriages were contracted by public declaration, often accompanied by written attestation. Children of mixed unions who were recognized by their fathers were counted as Russians. See Black 1990.) Among the Russian hostages was the mining engineer Dmitrii Tarkhanov, who during his stay accompanied the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> on a trek over Malaspina Glacier to the Copper River, and kept a travel journal describing this adventure. The Tarkhanov journal is translated by Lydia T. Black in section 3 of this volume (see also Grinev 1987,1997). </p>
	
	<p>Believing that the situation was firm, Baranov founded a settlement at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> in 1796, acting on a direct order from his employer, Shelikhov, in a letter of August 9, 1794 (Tikhmenev 1979, vol. 2:55-57). At that time, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> headman was Khatkeek, called by the Russians Starik, meaning “the old man:’ He was replaced soon thereafter by Toion Feodor, who was baptized into the Orthodox faith, with Baranov standing as his godfather (Grinev 1991:107). Eventually, however, around August 20, 1805, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>, led by Toion Feodor, destroyed Baranov’s operation. Baranov received the news from Ivan Repin, the manager of the outpost on Hinchinbrook Island, in a letter dated September 24, 1805 (Julian calendar), reproduced in appendix 2 of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Inspired by his victory over the Russians in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>, Toion Feodor soon led his warriors once again into the Chugach territory and against the Russian outpost on Hinchinbrook Island, where he was seized by the baidarshchik (work crew or outpost leader) Grigorii Uvarov. The Chugach defeated the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>, who lost about two hundred men. Feodor ended his life by his own hand (Khlebnikov 1835:102-4; 1973:57-59).</p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The Russian push into Southeast Alaska before 1799</a></h4><h5><i>Russians and other outsiders probe deeper into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory</i></h5>
	
	<p>Beginning in 1792-93, Baranov steadily probed the situation in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and Haida territories. His aim was to assert Russian presence in those areas and counter any attempts by British or Americans to establish permanent trading posts or settlements there. European traders (we do not discuss here any of the naval expeditions such as Cook’s for England, La Perouse’s for France, and several Spanish ones from 1775 to 1791)  appeared along the British Columbia and Alaska coasts as early as 1785-86, and American merchantmen soon followed, beginning with Metcalfe in 1788. In 1791-92, the Columbia and the Washington were the next two American vessels to sail in Alaskan waters. A lone French ship, the La Solide, commanded by Etienne Marchand sailed out of Marseille in 1790 and anchored in Sitka Bay (Norfolk Sound to the British; now called Sitka Sound) August 13-21, 1791. Here Marchand engaged in mutually beneficial trade with the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>. The voyage report, written by Charles P. C. Fleurieu, provides an extensive description of the land and its people (Fleurieu, 1801, vol. 1:189-258). The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">Marchand chart</a>, drawn in 1791, while not the first of Sitka Sound (that being Dixon’s of 1786), is historically important as the first written document to record the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> language ethnonym of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> Nation - Lingit Aani, meaning “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> country” or “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> land” or “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory.” Using the French spelling conventions of the day to write the new, non-French sounds of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> that they were hearing for the first time, the chart is entitled, “Plan de la Baie Tchinkitané,” or “Chart of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> Aani Bay” (see map 3). </p>
	
	<p>Fleurieu makes a plea for the use of Native toponyms instead of the practice of imposing foreign names. He writes, “I restore to the bay what belongs to it, the name which it has received from its inhabitants: if we were willing to act in this manner in regard to all the places whose proper names are known, we should preserve the nomenclature of geography, from those variations, annual as it were, which have no other object than to gratify the caprice or the vanity of a navigator” (1801, vol. 1:198). </p>
	
	<p>Fleurieu reports that, in addition to the well-known British traders Dixon and Portlock, American vessels had visited Sitka Sound earlier, as the people who came to trade with them possessed copper coins minted in Massachusetts (Fleurieu 1801:1:191). Filipp A. Kashevarov, who had been in Alaska since 1794, believed that some foreign ships had been observed even near Kodiak prior to his arrival.</p>
	
	<p>Fleurieu is happy to note the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>’ very limited possession of firearms, and he feels fortunate to be able to document <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> life in relatively traditional form, which he laments will rapidly change with increased foreign contact. He admires the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> as shrewd traders,  and notes that they are already middlemen in the fur trade, trading not only furs that they had hunted themselves but also furs acquired by trade from others for the purpose of further barter with the Europeans. And, of course, European trade goods were passing in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> direction.</p>
	
	<p>British trade rapidly declined due to the geopolitical situation in Europe, where the Napoleonic wars raged and England was committed to a fight against the French that lasted until 1814 (see Gibson 1992). By 1801 Americans in the Northwest Coast fur trade outnumbered the British twenty-two to two (Malloy 1998:26). Nevertheless, Captain Henry Barber, a British merchant skipper and important player in the battle of Sitka in 1802, called at Sitka in 1796 on the Arthur (Khlebnikov 1833:6) and again in the following years.</p>
	
	<p>The Americans traded to the Natives firearms and ammunition, cannons, and rum, as well as customary trade items such as cloth, buttons, beads, and metal objects (Khlebnikov 1973:28-29). In addition, several “Boston” skippers also traded slaves, buying them from one Native group for resale to another (Malloy 1998:39, 54-55). In addition to trading in indigenous slaves captured from rival Northwest Coast groups, the Americans also expanded the African slave trade to Alaska. According to Ivan Kuskov, writing in 1802, “It is said that in Chilkat and other places in exchange for ... otter they give black people, either from the coast of Africa or from the Wine Island, I do not know which” (Russian-American Company 1976:144-45; see also Tikhmenev 1979:140 in section 6 of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>, in a new translation). </p>
	
	<p>Because of the conditions of life aboard ship and the obedience exacted by the lash, crews often mutinied. In many such cases, the skippers left the malcontents on shore, where some of them joined Native communities,</p>
	
	
	<p>and others were killed. Survivors often tried to rejoin a European or American ship (Howay 1973:38-39; Jackman 1978:123; Malloy 1998:55). Bostonians and Englishmen may have fought and died on both sides in the Sitka battle of 1802 (discussed below). </p>
	
	<p>As American vessels pushed northward among the archipelagoes off the coast of Alaska and into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory at the head of the Lynn Canal, the Russians probed ever further south. Several vessels sailed from Kodiak, Resurrection Bay in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>. Among the navigators, the most active was James Shields, who charted his 1793, 1796, and 1797 voyages between Kodiak and Southeast Alaska (see Black 2004a:147, fig . 31). Others included Podgash and Gavriil Talin.</p>
	
	<p>Young Filipp Kashevarov, who, as already mentioned, came to Alaska in 1794 at the age of fifteen, was apprenticed to Shields and sailed with him on at least two voyages, beginning in 1795. In 1822 he provided a wealth of information pertaining to these early years in response to questions posed to him by K. T. Khlebnikov. This previously unpublished archival document in Russian is reproduced in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a> in full in an English translation by Lydia T. Black.</p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The founding of Old Sitka, 1799</a></h4><h5><i>The Russians settle in Sitka in the first sustained contact between the Russians and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a></i></h5>
	
	<p>Baranov explored the Southeast, sailing the Ol’ga, a small vessel built for him on Woody Island in the Kodiak Archipelago. In 1795 he was in Cross Sound, Bay of Islands (modern Salisbury Sound), and Sitka Sound. On this voyage, he named Olga Strait (leading into Sitka Sound) after his sturdy ship, and at the northwest end of Sitka Sound he placed a wooden cross at a site to this day called Port Krestof (Orth [1967]1971:545) - in Russian, Krestovskaia Gavan; that is, “harbor of the cross” (see Khlebnikov 1835:5). It is probable that on this same voyage, Baranov also named Yakobi Island (called Takhanes in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>) for Ivan Iakobi, the governor-general of Irkutsk and Kolyvan guberniia (in Siberia, 1783-89), and patron of Baranov’s late employer, Grigorii Shelikhov (see Baranov’s letter dated 1797, in the Russian State Historical Archive, St. Petersburg, [RGIA, Fond 1374, op. 2, d. 1672, fols. 1- 1V]).  </p>
	
	<p>Hunting parties continued to explore the Southeast in 1797-98. By 1799 Baranov had completed several voyages, reaching at least once the territory of the Kaigani Haida. On that voyage, he decided that the time had come to establish an outpost in the south. Having reconnoitered the area, Baranov decided that the most suitable location for his new Russian outpost was Sitka Sound, named Norfolk Sound by the British merchant captain Dixon in 1786 (the Lingit Aani or Tchinkitfme of the 1791 Marchand chart).</p>
	
	<p>Baranov had visited the sound several times and observed that there was a substantial population in the area and that foreign vessels came frequently to trade. He evidently believed that a Russian permanent settlement in the sound would discourage the by now predominantly American vessels that came there to trade only in the summer season, offering rum, guns, and ammunition in exchange for the maximum possible number of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">sea otters</a>, and often engaging in severe fighting with the Natives, without regard for the future (Malloy 1998:44-60, especially pp. 48, 57, 59). Baranov wanted to check foreign trade and provide a support base closer than the distant <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> for far-ranging sea-otter hunting parties.</p>
	
	<p>Large parties composed of Alutiit of the Kodiak Archipelago and Alaska Peninsula, the Chugach, and a few Russians had been hunting in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and Haida territories of Southeast Alaska, transported on the small sailing vessels of Baranov’s growing fleet, and then left to hunt <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">sea otters</a> on their own by baidarka, without an escort. In 1799 such a party of 550 baidarkas (about 1,100 men) was dispatched aboard the Ekaterina, with navigator Podgash commanding. The ship carried building supplies and equipment, but her arrival in Sitka Sound was delayed by the disembarcation and disposition of various units of the hunting party. The vessel Orel, navigator Talin commanding; arrived first. On board was the veteran promyshlennik leader, navigator, explorer, and shipwright Vasilii G. Medvednikov, a man of probity, courage, and trust. At least once he had risked his life to save an Alutiiq sailor (Kashevarov MS in section 4 of this volume).</p>
	
	<p>Baranov had appointed Medvednikov as commander of the fort to be built, and Medvednikov took charge immediately. First of all, he sent the hunting party back to Kodiak, thus reducing the number of men to be fed. This was the party that had lost over a hundred men to shellfish poisoning in Peril Strait, a major episode in the sequence of events culminating in the battle of 1802. The Ekaterina was sent south to Bucareli Bay. Medvednikov then explored Sitka Sound and chose a location for the future settlement, relatively near yet not too close to the existing <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> settlement on and around Castle Hill in modern downtown Sitka. In today’s context, the Russians were building at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">“Old Sitka”</a> on Starrigavan Bay (Orth [1967]1971:720) near what is now the ferry terminal. The name derives from Russian Staraia Gavan’, “old harbor:” The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> name for this locality is Gajaa Héen, and the nearby place, where the Russians built a forge by a stream entered by red salmon, is <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">Wat.lachéiix’i</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov arrived at Sitka Sound on July 7, 1799. Although he had visited the bay previously, he spent six days exploring it more thoroughly. In the end, he approved Medvednikov’s choice of location. Baranov invited the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders and requested permission from them to build a settlement. Gifts were exchanged, and Baranov believed that a mutually satisfactory agreement had been reached. </p>
	
	<p>On July 15, 1799, Baranov’s men, about fifty Alutiit, aided by the crew of the Ekaterina, now back from Bucareli Bay, began to fell timber for construction. By autumn, the essential structures were up and the settlement was named Novoarkhangel’sk (New Archangel) in honor of the ancient Russian port on the White Sea, Arkhangel’sk, and was placed under the protection of the Commander of the Heavenly Hosts (Archstrategos) St. Michael the Archangel. </p>
	
	<p>Apparently aware of the importance of ritual symbolism among the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>, in October 1799 Baranov composed an order of ceremonies to mark the establishment of this new, permanent Russian outpost. The ceremonial activities were apparently planned to emphasize that the Russians were here to stay. The ceremony was performed in April 1800, coinciding with the Easter feast. This text, from Russian archival sources and previously unpublished, is reproduced in section 5 of this volume in full in English translation.</p>
	
	<p>Over the course of the winter, Baranov made it a point to meet with the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders and especially to establish good relations with Shk’awulyeil (Skautelt in Russian documents, also called Mikhail, or, in anglophone literature and translations from the Russian, Michael), the main leader of the Sitka Kiks.ádi. Baranov gave him a bronze imperial crest and a charter dated March 25, 1800, which Baranov himself had composed. This charter was intended as proof that the Russian settlement was established legitimately, with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> permission, through gift exchange and diplomatic negotiations (Khlebnikov 1985: 42-43).</p>
	
	<p>Nevertheless, there were troubling signs. Not all of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders were in favor of permitting the Russians to settle in their territory. One event in particular disturbed Baranov. On Easter 1800, he planned a feast, to which he invited the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leadership. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> woman who was sent to Sitka to deliver the invitation was abused and Baranov felt the need for a show of force (Khlebnikov 1835:54; 1973:30; see also Baranov’s letter to Larionov of July 24, 1800, in section 5 of this volume).</p>
	
	<p>However, things quieted down and, on April 22, 1800, Baranov sailed for Kodiak, leaving Medvednikov in charge. Prokhor Nakvasin was appointed clerk, second in command. Several geographic features on Baranof Island – a  lake, an inlet, a strait, etc. (most notably Nakwasina Sound and Nakwasina Passage, both just to the north of the 1802 battle site) – are named for him (see Orth [1967l 1971:671). (Nakwasina Sound is Daxeit in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>-an important place name in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition. Unfortunately, Orth explains the names erroneously. He derives them from the alleged Russian word for “fermented” or “fermentation.”) According to Baranov, his men numbered twenty-five Russians at that time, some of whom were children of Russian and Native unions. (As already mentioned, at that time, the term “Creole” did not exist, and children of Russian fathers were listed as Russians.) Fifty or fifty-five Alaskans, mostly Alutiit, but also Aleut from as far away as the Andreanof Islands, were stationed there also. Some men had their Native wives and children with them, and a few soon established “tender ties” with <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women, among them Amvrosii Plotnikov.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov described the structures of the new settlement in several letters to various correspondents, of which excerpts of two (Baranov to Rodionov, May 14, 1800, and Baranov to Larionov, July 24, 1800) are reproduced in section 5 of this volume, as well as excerpts from his biography describing the winter of 1799. Baranov was keenly aware of the need to ensure <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> good will. He was well aware of the numerical weakness of the Russian settlement vis-à-vis the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, and he cautioned Medvednikov on the necessity of maintaining good relations and avoiding any conduct that would cause offense. Baranov’s ideas are clearly expressed in his parting instruction to Medvednikov, reproduced in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>’ strength can be estimated on the basis of a traditional account of the Kiks.ádi clan houses at Sitka. At the time, there were four Kiks.ádi houses at the settlement on Castle Hill. The number of Kaagwaantaan houses (or those of other clans, such as the Chookaneidf or the L’uknax.ádi) is not known. Estimated Russian census figures, based primarily on expected warrior strength, help to project the total <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> population at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Khlebnikov estimated the total <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> population of the Southeast to be about 50,000. Archival data first published by Grinev (1991:263- 65; 2005:281-82) are translated in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>; also included is new research on the Kiks.ádi houses contributed by indigenous scholars. </p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">The Battle of 1802 at Old Sitka</a></h4><h5>Anóoshi Lingítch shawuxeejí<i>, or “When the Tlingits took a club to the Russians,” is the popular Tlingit description of the battle</i></h5></p>
	
	<p>This section discusses the causes and various accounts of the battle. See appendix 1 for discussion of casualties</p>
	
	<p>The outpost of Novoarkhangel’sk on the northeast shore of Sitka Sound operated apparently without much interference from the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> for the next year and a half. However, Medvednikov had no control over the behavior of the summer hunting parties. Baidarshchiks and the Alutiiq and Chugach hunters often violated orders. Several killings of important <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders – in one case the alleged murder of a Kuiu leader and his wife and children – and the seizure and putting in irons of at least one <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> noble are mentioned by participants or near contemporaries, and we find confirmation of some of these data in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral traditions. One <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition bearer, A. P. Johnson, maintains that Russians raped <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women taking walks in the woods, and if a husband accompanied his wife, they incapacitated him (see this volume). <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition bearer Mark Jacobs Jr. states that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> clan members were resentful when Russians married <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women without paying the customary bride price (i.e., without giving gifts) (1990:4; also in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>).</p>
	
	<p>At the same time, American and British merchantmen were fomenting discontent among the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> and Haidas. Trading in weapons, they often exacerbated intersettlement conflicts (Malloy 1998:54, 57, 58). The Russians, who did not trade in armaments or alcohol, believed that the foreigners were inciting the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> against them in order to eliminate competition (Khlebnikov 1833; also in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). In 1802, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> decided to destroy the Russian outpost.</p>
	
	<p>On a Sunday afternoon, June 15, 1802, when the men (Russians and Alutiit) were either resting or attending to private tasks, some fishing and some sea-lion hunting, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> attacked the fort of Novoarkhangel’sk at Old Sitka. The fort, defended by no more than sixteen men, and hampered by panicked women and children, fell in short order. We note here that Khlebnikov (183P6) gives the date as falling on June 18 or 19, but Artemiev (1994:41, note 30) established that Sunday fell on June 15 that year.</p>
	
	<p>The story of the battle has been recounted many times in published materials. A few of these accounts are second hand, by near contemporaries (Davydov 1977; Shemelin 1816-18; Litke 1861:149). Some historians (Tikhmenev 1861-63; Bancroft [1886]1970; Okun’ 1939; Andrews 1922) utilized these accounts. All are derivative, oversimplified versions of earlier historical descriptions. They abound in errors of fact, fallacious interpretations, and crass stereotypes.</p>
	
	<p>Recent scholarship, especially in Russia, attempts to rectify the situation (Grinev 1991, 1994, 1999a, 1999b, 2005; Artemiev 1994, 1998, 1999; Istomin 1985), but their efforts are hampered by lack of knowledge of local conditions in Alaska and of recent work by American scholars such as Arndt (1988) and Dean (1993; 1997). Moreover, their access to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition is at best indirect.</p>
	
	<p>In contrast to the use of secondhand accounts, in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>, we present in translation testimonies by eyewitness survivors and an extensive account by a near-contemporary, K.T. Khlebnikov. Khlebnikov based his account (1833) on his conversations with Baranov, Kuskov, and at least one survivor. Some of this material is reprinted from existing English translations. Where existing translations are unsatisfactory, material has been retranslated from Russian by Lydia T. Black. Khlebnikov’s Russian publication of 1833 has never been translated and appears here in English for the first time, in a translation by Lydia Black. We also publish for the first time <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral traditions recorded over forty years ago by elders such as Sally Hopkins (1958), Alex Andrews (1960), A. P. Johnson (n.d., 1979), and others. Although a synopsis based on a paraphrased English version of the account by Sally Hopkins was presented in a site report for the National Park Service (West 1959:82-89; see also Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1990) and has found limited circulation, the complete <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> text of her story as transcribed from the tape recording is published here for the first time, accompanied by facing English translation. Likewise, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> transcription and facing English translation of the account by Alex Andrews (1960) are published here for the first time. The two accounts recorded in English by the late A. P. Johnson were only recently discovered by his family and were generously contributed to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a> by his son and grandson. His grandson, Steve Johnson Jr., restored the tape recordings electronically. </p>
	
	<p>The facts, the conduct of the battle, and the aftermath presented in the Russian documents and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition agree in all the main points: the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> surprise attack on the unfinished fort at Gajaa Héen in great numbers by sea in battle canoes and through the forest; the first death, that of the outlook or sentry at Wat.lachéix’’i; the setting on fire of the main building; the salvaging of stored furs by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>; and the torture of prisoners. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition differs in that the sentry is identified as a blacksmith. The famous <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> war leader Kalyaan is said to have led the charge, killing the blacksmith and taking his hammer as a trophy. The hammer became Kalyaan’s cherished battle weapon, an at.óow (like a clan heirloom; see glossary) made famous in the accounts of the 1804 battle. Kalyaan and all the aristocrats of the Kiks.ádi clan wore sashes of red felt, surely a cultural innovation.</p>
	
	<p>Stoonook, whose father was a Kaagwaantaan, and Duk’aan, whose father belonged to the Chookaneidi clan, led the charge at the entry into the main building (not Kalyaan as Russian records attest, although he was in command). The two young men were the first to die when Medvednikov and Tumakov discharged a small cannon through the door.</p>
	
	<p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> narrators disagree about how the main house was set on fire. Andrews and Johnson state that old men, too old to fight, discharged flaming arrows into the building. Sally Hopkins recounts how two elders entering the building through a small undefended doorway in the back set the structure on fire. We find no confirmation in our sources that the fire was started by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women residing within the fort, nor for the assertion that an American inside the fort thus aided the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>. Nor is there confirmation that American sailors led the charge (Grinev 1991, 1999b:62). No eyewitness account mentions such an involvement, although Khlebnikov mentions that prior to Baranov’s arrival at Sitka, eleven men from an American vessel were left ashore, three of whom joined the Russians, and eight the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>. The nationalities of these sailors is not stated, except that the three joining the Russians were Englishmen (1833:10-11). Grinev’s assertions about Americans’ involvement in the 1802 battle of Sitka are based on secondary and derivative sources. He cites as one authority H. H. Bancroft ([1886] 1970: 408-9) but does not indicate that he is citing Bancroft’s note 3. Grinev may have misread Bancroft’s statement discussing alleged American participation as presented by Captain William Sturgis, of the Caroline. Bancroft expresses in general strong objections to accounts of Russians in Alaska by “American and English captains of that day.” He singles out Sturgis’s account, specifically stating, “Knowing the facts, it is not possible that the writer intended to tell the truth,” (408) and concludes in respect to other statements by Sturgis that they are “pure invention” (409). Nevertheless, the involvement of Europeans and Euro-Americans in the 1802 battle is possible and even probable (Howay 1973:38-39; Jackman 1978:123; Malloy 1998:55). </p>
	
	<p>In comparing Russian and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> sources, problematic are representations concerning the cause of this violent event and the roles of the various participants: <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leadership from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> to Stikine, their Kaigani Haida</p>

	<p>and Tsimshian allies, the American and British merchant skippers, the Russians, and the Alutiit and other Alaska Natives acting in concert with the Russians. It is important to remember that Russian accounts emphasize economic competition with English and American traders and the global geopolitical situation, while the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition deals exclusively with participation in the events of 1802 and 1804 by the Kiks.ádi clan of the Raven moiety of Sitka. We will discuss some of this background here, especially the spectacular expansion of the fur trade and increasing competition for the Native trade. </p>
	
	<p>The Europeans (British, Spanish, and French) had affected the Northwest Coast of America since the pioneering voyage of James Cook in 1778. The navy expeditions engaged in trade only sporadically, and such contacts were for the most part nonviolent. Some trade goods, cloth, clothing, small iron items (nails and knives), and beads were exchanged for sea otter skins. </p>
	
	<p>Beginning with the 1785-86 British activity, the volume of contact rapidly escalated to “the frenzy of uncontrolled trade” described by Malloy (1998:27). The merchant vessels were heavily armed, and violent confrontations initiated by one side or the other were frequent, with casualties on both sides. Occasionally, Natives captured a ship and massacred or enslaved the crew. Armed retaliation was taken for granted by Europeans and Americans both. </p>
	
	<p>Americans soon dominated the trade (Gibson 1992:28- 35; Malloy 1998:27; Richards 1991:30-36). The number of goods traded for sea otter and fur seals increased. The East Coast entrepreneurs who financed the voyages considered the trade a long term investment, and for this reason they instructed the skippers not to engage in violence against the Natives (Malloy 1998:27, 58-59).</p>
	
	<p>However, the vessels and crews were heavily armed, and many if not all skippers disregarded their instructions. Cannons were used frequently to demonstrate the superiority of the intruders. It is also doubtful that the skippers, looking to enrich their personal fortunes, thought much about the consequences of their actions, either in arms or alcohol trade.</p>
	
	<p>Competition between individual skippers and merchant companies grew ever more intense as the number of vessels operating in the same summer grew. In 1791 there were seven American vessels alone on the Northwest coast (Malloy 1998:27). Violence became more frequent. We would like to cite as an example Captain Simon Metcalfe, known for his reckless slaughter of Natives in Hawaii and on the American coast. In the end, his vessel was taken, and all hands died. Contemporary hearsay ascribed the event to the Haidas, but it is not unlikely that in actuality it could have been the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>. In either 1794 or 1795, there were six vessels operating on the Northwest coast, of which three were taken by the Natives (Richards 1991:165-67).</p>
	
	<p>Rhys Richards, who published Metcalfe’s biography and the account of his death, wrote, “Violence such as this massacre had already become a hallmark of the trade. Both sides were at fault and frequently … kidnapping, indiscriminate seizures, and the destruction of all or part of uncooperative villages, alas, were not isolated or rare occurrences” (1991:167-68). We should bear Richards’s statement in mind when examining the actions of American captains against the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> of Sitka in 1802 (described in Schuhmacher’s research on Captain Barber, included in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>).</p>
	
	<p>Nevertheless, Natives eagerly traded with the Europeans, especially for firearms. Intergroup conflict, if not constant, was frequent and savage. Mary Malloy writes, “Battles among various groups are often described in the journals of American mariners. In 1802 the Atahualpa was twice encouraged by Native people to fire their guns at their enemies. Captain Daniel Cross raced to Lynn Canal to sell guns to the Chilkat <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> when he heard that they were at war with a neighboring tribe” (1998:57; see also Dean 1997). Revenge, both in international and intertribal conflicts, was taken for granted (Malloy 1998: 57- 60). </p>
	
	<p>The Russian permanent presence in the area central to this armament trade was more than inconvenient for the European and American skippers. While Baranov feared the effect on Russian fur trade with China, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> may have pondered the effect of the Russian presence on the flow of war supplies. Moreover, Russians did not trade the same goods, but still competed with the Americans and Europeans for <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">sea otters</a>. For example, in 1799, prior to Baranov’s arrival, one American and two English vessels traded in Sitka Sound. These were probably the Caroline, Hancock, and the Despatch (Khlebnikov 1833:10; Howay 1973:36). The Caroline, out of Boston, was commanded by Captain Richard Cleveland. In the account of his voyage, Cleveland states that the Natives of Sitka Sound made several attempts to capture his vessel (1850, vol. 1:92-95, 105, as footnoted in Bancroft [1886] 1970:388). </p>
	
	<p>Baranov mentions two European ships in the early summer of 1799, and two more arriving in July. In February and March of 1800, three Bostonian ships arrived (see Baranov’s letters of 1800 in section 5 of this volume). Apparently, due to the Russian presence and large number of Alutiiq and other Natives under Baranov’s command, there were no hostile actions. However, even much later, with several cases documented as late as 1810, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, Haidas, and Tsimshians attacked American trading vessels. John D’Wolf in 1806 suspected that Xutsnoowu (Angoon) <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> were going to attack his ship Juno. He prepared for defense, but in the end decided to stay in Sitka Sound, safe in the Russian settlement. Excerpts from John D’Wolf’s account are reproduced in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov, as his instructions to Medvednikov clearly demonstrate, desired peaceful, continuous trade relations. However, he could not control the situation on the ground. As already noted above, Alutiit and Chugach partovshchiki (members of Baranov’s long-range hunting parties) were operating in the territory of their ancient enemies. We know from Russian accounts of several instances where the “Aleuts” plundered <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> caches and killed individual <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> when the occasion offered. For example, Kuskov’s 1802 report to Baranov mentions an alleged vandalizing and/or robbery of a grave site near Kuiu and the murder of a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader, along with his wife and children, the wife being a sister of a Stikine chief. In another incident suggesting motive, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leadership of some settlements may have chosen to move against the Russians after the Alutiit killed “up to ten persons of their clan” (Khlebnikov 1833:16 and 80, in English in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>), or because of the robbery and murder at Kuiu mentioned above (Kuskov 1802, also translated in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>).</p>
	
	<p>Baranov’s problem of lack of control over his men was not limited to Alaska. Pierce (1984:xi-xii) discusses the efforts of Governor Ludwig (known in Russian as Leontii) Hagemeister in 1818 to investigate the slaughter of local Indians by Kodiak islanders on a small island off the California coast. This incident is featured in a children’s book, The Island of the Blue Dolphin (O’Dell 1960) and in a motion picture of the same name. The Russian foreman was shipped to Russia for trial for failure to restrain his men. The story was preserved in California folklore and is studied by historians to this day. </p>
	
	<p>The shellfish poisoning of 1799, when over a hundred Native hunters died in Peril Strait, in all probability affected local Russian/<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> relations, increasing feelings of mutual distrust and fear. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> tried at first to help the stricken AIutiit, but were overwhelmed by the number of dying men. Khlebnikov speculates that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> were afraid of being accused of witchcraft (Khlebnikov 1833:7-9, also in English translation in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). </p>
	
	<p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition stresses the imprisonment of a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> ritual specialist (shaman) and the indignities he suffered at the hands of the Russians and/or their Alutiiq and Chugach allies following the shellfish poisoning incident of 1799. Three narrators (Johnson, Andrews, and Hopkins) relate that the ritual specialist Heendei, of the Point House headed by Kalyaan, befriended an old Aleut, painting his face red with ochre. The Aleut died, and the Russians seized Heendei. While in Russian captivity, he (in one version a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> aristocrat visiting the Russians) was fed human flesh, a piece cut out of the thigh of the dead Aleut. Cannibalism was an abomination to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, but they believed that the “primitive” Russians did eat human flesh.</p>
	
	<p>Although <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition also stresses personal <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">revenge</a> as a motive for the conflict, and although it may have been a contributing factor, it seems unlikely to have been the sole cause. In one account (Worl1996:109-1O), an unidentified eighty-year-old Kiks.ádi elder claims that K’alyáan swore to take revenge on the Russians who brutalized and killed a Kiks.ádi woman. This motif, but in reverse, also appears in the Russian sources. Baranov noted that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> woman interpreter he had sent to invite the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> to an Easter celebration had been beaten and crippled not by the local men but by visitors from a distant location. In retaliation, Baranov led his twenty-two men, armed with guns and cannon, to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> settlement at the site of modern Sitka to demonstrate that he – would not tolerate insults to any of his people. He claimed that after this show of force, relations returned to normal (see Baranov’s letter to Larionov, July 24, 1800, included in section 5 of this volume).</p>
	
	<p>Kiks.ádi traditions also stress the shame that Point House suffered when K’alyáan’s younger brother, Stoonook, on a visit with his father to Kaagwaantaan relatives at Chilkat, was taunted by people there for suffering the Russian presence and was •told that soon they would become Russian slaves. Khlebnikov (1833:79, translated in section 6 of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>) also mentions such taunting, but ascribes it to the European and American traders.</p>
	
	<p>As strong as these provocations were, they seem relatively minor in contrast to the formation of an unprecedented, multiclan, multicommunity, even multinational, anti-Russian alliance from <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a> in the north to the Kaigani Haida in the south (Khlebnikov 1833, also translated in section 6 of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). We are not convinced that these provocations alone explain the underlying reasons for the alliance and the coordinated, simultaneous attacks on Russian positions on three separate fronts (the skirmishes with Kuskov along the northern coast, the major attack on the Urbanov party near Kake, and, of course, the attack at Sitka). Revenge for the slaying of kinsmen would have been exacted by clans directly related to the victims. The insult to a ritual specialist (or any other clan member of high standing) likewise would have been considered a private matter concerning only the relatives of the injured party. These incidents, however, although isolated, seem widespread and common enough to contribute to a growing atmosphere of resentment of and hostility toward the Russian presence.</p>
	
	<p>On the other hand, it appears somewhat surprising and puzzling that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> armed conflicts with traders and the casualties suffered in hostile confrontations with these American and British trading vessels, well documented by modern American scholars, do not figure as grievances in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral traditions available to us. Therefore, it seems more likely that the Russians’ forming permanent establishments and trespassing deep into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and Haida territories in sea-otter hunting parties launched out of Sitka and composed of traditional enemies of the northern <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, as well as consideration of advantages offered by trade with Euro-Americans may have been strategic reasons for the formation of the Haida-<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> anti-Russian alliance. But it is important to remember that not all <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> were unanimous in the decision to attack the Russians. There are documented incidents of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> warning the Russians of impending attacks (see Kuskov 1802 and Khelbnikov 1833, both translated in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). Although the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> did mount a united attack on three fronts at the same time, there was still disagreement among the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders.</p>
	
	<p>Khlebnikov’s opinion, apparently also held by Baranov (Khlebnikov 1833, 1835), is that the foreigners incited the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> to organize and attack simultaneously at Sitka, Kake, and south of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>. This thesis is supported by the documentary account (included elsewhere in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>) of the behavior of Captains William Cunningham of the Globe and John Ebbets of the Alert (both Americans), and Barber of the Unicorn (British; later captain of the Myrtle). Sturgis (Jackman 1978:123-26) describes this incident also, but in very general terms, without mentioning the skippers’ names. Not only did these gentlemen arrive in Sitka Sound while the flames of the Russian fort were still burning, they ended up with almost the entire store of Russian sea otter pelts. Moreover, they hanged at least one, and possibly three, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders, one after a drumhead court martial (Schuhmacher 1979 and Khlebnikov 1833:23-24, both also in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). </p>
	
	<p>When Shk’awulyeil and his nephew Kalyaan came aboard Barber’s vessel, he ordered both hoisted up and tied to the yardarm, where they were held until additional sea otter skins and several captives were brought to him. For Barber, apparently, this was a standard practice. According to Khlebnikov (1833:6, also in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>), in 1796 James Shields (Shilts) entered Krestovaia Bay, where he found Barber’s vessel Arthur at anchor. A <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> toion (chief) visited Shilts and bitterly recounted how Barber had invited him aboard and feasted him, but then had put him in irons and kept him thus until the toion and his followers had surrendered all the sea otter pelts they had on hand. But later, Barber must have come to an understanding with the Sitka <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, possibly with a different leader than the one who suffered at his hands in 1796. </p>
	
	<p>It seems to us that if the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders had any reason to fear Barber, they would not have gone so eagerly and unsuspectingly aboard. Barber’s actions suggest a double cross. We speculate that after trading arms, ammunition, and powder, and urging a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> attack on the Russian fort and warehouse, Barber then double-crossed the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> and seized the captives and the furs. He took the survivors to Kodiak and demanded that Baranov pay him a ransom of 50,000 rubles in cash or furs at a price that he would determine. In the end, after prolonged bargaining, Barber settled for 10,000 rubles worth of furs, and he released the survivors only after Baranov delivered the furs (Khlebnikov 1835:69; 1973:38). Barber then sailed on to Canton, where he sold the furs to the Chinese.</p>
	
	<p>The actual course of the battle is well described in the documents we present here. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> won the battle, but not the war. In 1804 Baranov exacted vengeance from Kake and other villages that participated in the destruction of the sea-otter hunting party and then retook Sitka itself. Castle Hill, where several clan houses were located, became Russian property, the future port of Novoarkhangel’sk. </p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Baranov returns: The Battle of 1804 at Indian River</a></h4><h5><i>Baranov assembles the allied attack force; accounts of the battle; <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> retreat; peacemaking; <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> resettle in Sitka </i></h5>
	
	<p>The day of the battle, Sunday, June 15, 1802, was ending. The victors were searching for any defenders who might have escaped and for those who were not at the fort when the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> attacked, and many were busy saving the furs stored in the smoldering warehouses: to the victor belong the spoils.</p>
	
	<p>The Aleut women and children were rounded up and taken away as prisoners. According to one <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> woman found two abandoned infants, a boy and a girl, and took them for her own (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition, Demmert family). The fate of two <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women, married to Russians, who stayed at the fort, is not known, except that one later returned to her Russian husband. A Russian was aided in his escape by his <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> brothers-in-law (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition, Martin family). The escaped Russian, Amvrosii Plotnikov, returned to the ruined, still-smoking settlement in the night only to see the mangled, beheaded bodies of the Russian dead and cattle, and many cattle in distress that had been speared but not killed. Helpless, Plotnikov returned to the woods (his account is included in section 6 of this volume).</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> mourned their dead. The leadership prepared to meet with their American and British trading partners and anticipated exceptional profit. The next day three trading ships were in the bay. The double cross was about to begin. The traders would not trade. They demanded the return of any Russian or Aleut survivors (hoping to ransom them on Kodiak) and also the surrender of all furs without recompense. Several <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> canoes were fired on with grapeshot, and many warriors died. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders who came aboard the ships of their presumed allies to share in the spoils of victory were seized, humiliated, and put on trial aboard an American ship in mock military justice; at least one <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader was hanged. Then the Europeans and Americans sailed away. Full accounts of these events are featured in section 6 of this volume. </p>
	
	<p>The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> victory over the Russian fort of Novoarkhangel’sk did not bring the expected results. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no record or oral tradition survives documenting the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> reaction to the European double cross. Perhaps they assumed that through the assembled massive forces of unified clans they would be able to control the future.</p>
	
	<p>News of the destruction of Novoarkhangel’sk on June 15, 1802 (as mentioned above, we accept the date as established by Artemiev), reached Baranov within several weeks. On July 24, 1802, the British vessel Unicorn, commanded by Barber, put in at St. Paul Harbor on Kodiak. On board were the survivors of the attack: three Russians, two Alutiiq men, and eighteen Alutiiq women and children. Baranov, at that time busy on Afognak Island, was immediately called back to the harbor. Barber trained twenty guns on the town and demanded ransom for the survivors in furs. What kind of information Barber provided Baranov on the state of affairs in Sitka is not known. More reliable information was sent to Baranov by Kuskov, who that year commanded the long-range hunting party out of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>. Kuskov had saved his detachment only through careful attention to the mood among the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> warriors he encountered, heeding warnings by friendly <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>, and extreme vigilance at all times. Even then, he did not escape several skirmishes, and suffered casualties. Kuskov grew more and more apprehensive and decided to seek help and reinforcements from the Old Sitka fort. Instead, he learned of the fort’s destruction. He wrote to Baranov immediately, on July 1, 1802, but it is not known when Baranov received this letter. This letter is reproduced in full in English translation by Black in section 6 of this volume (see also Russian-American Company 1976:128-50, document 9)</p>
	
	<p> Only on September 5 did Kuskov arrive in Kodiak aboard the Sv. Ekaterina and report to his chief in person (Khlebnikov 1835:68-71; 1973:37-39). By the time Kuskov arrived at Kodiak, Chief Manager Baranov was already planning to retake the lost territory. Baranov’s reasons were manifold. Foremost was his conviction that if he did not return, the foreign merchantmen would be in complete control of the fur trade on the Northwest Coast, and, possibly, moving northward, could endanger the older established Russian outposts in the Kodiak Archipelago, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>, and Cook Inlet. His fear was grounded in the fact that at that particular time, due to vagaries of the Napoleonic wars in Europe, England was on the verge of becoming an enemy of Russia. </p>
	
	<p>The second consideration, of less global scope, but of primary importance in any future relations with the Natives, was the fact that failure to avenge one’s dead would earn Baranov contempt. Baranov had also suffered personal loss: Vasilii Medvednikov and Prokhor Nakvasin, veterans of the 1783-86 voyage to Kodiak with Grigorii Shelikhov and his most trusted employees and personal friends, had both been killed at Old Sitka.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov’s impulse was to strike back immediately, but reality interfered. He was extremely short of men arid armament, and his forces were scattered in small groups over an enormous territory. His situation in 1802 cannot be understood without reference to earlier years, beginning with Baranov’s arrival on Kodiak in 1791.</p>
	
	<p>Grigorii Shelikhov recruited Baranov to be manager of his enterprise in the Kodiak Archipelago only. However, Shelikhov expected Baranov to expand onto the Alaska mainland – and that meant competition and conflict with the most powerful rival company, Lebedev-Lastochkin. This well-organized company was by that time dominant on the upper Alaska Peninsula and Bristol Bay, and was sending probes to the Kuskokwim/Yukon areas; it also controlled Cook Inlet, with outposts at Cape Douglas (off Kamyshak Bay) and lower Kenai Peninsula, as well as at Tyonek, Knik, and Turnagain Arm. The first outpost gave them access to Lakes Iliamna and Clark, and the second two gave Lebedev-Lastochkin control over the portages to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>. Portaging in skin boats, the Lebedev-Lastochkin men lost no time in establishing themselves in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>, from Montague and Green islands in the west, to Middleton Island in the south, and Hinchinbrook Island in the east. Baranov also had to keep a firm hold on Kodiak Islanders. </p>
	
	<p>It is unfortunate that no serious scholar has ever undertaken a study of the Lebedev-Lastochkin Company – and especially of the crucial decade when Baranov began to gain the upper hand. The scurrilous remarks that appear in the documents of the surviving Russian-American Company correspondence and in the derivative literature must be taken with a grain of salt. Strong circumstantial evidence indicates that Natives – Chugach and Alaska Peninsula Alutiit, but most prominently Dena’ina (Kenaitsy or Tanaina Athabaskans of Cook Inlet) – were drawn into the fight. Baranov complained that LebedevLastochkin men incited the Natives to hostilities against him; however, Archimandrite Ioasaf, head of the spiritual mission, in his letter to Shelikhov of May 20, 1795, states firmly that Baranov caused the Natives to attack Lebedev-Lastochkin outposts.</p>
	
	<p>We do know that the outpost at Tyonek, on the western shore of Cook Inlet, was destroyed and all the men there were killed (Stafeev MS; Dena’ina tradition), and Filipp Kashevarov (see this volume) tells us that the settlement at Lake Iliamna, where the Lebedev-Lastochkin men lived a Native lifestyle with their Dena’ina families, was also wiped out to the last man, woman, and child. These circumstances should be kept in mind when we consider that at the time Baranov was gathering forces to retaliate for the 1802 destruction of Old Sitka, his men had already suffered casualties in the Dena’ina territory in Cook Inlet and in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a> at the hands of the Chugach and Ahtna of Copper River. We do not exclude the possibility that some of these killings were settlings of old scores by former allies of the Lebedev-Lastochkin men. Moreover, catastrophic losses of Alutiiq, Chugach, and Aleut men on long-distance sea-otter hunting parties (the 1799 deaths by shellfish poisoning and the Urbanov party in 1802, among others)  made recruitment of Native men extremely difficult. Even on Kodiak there was unrest, and a rebellion occurred there at Karluk.</p>
	
	<p>Exactly how many Russians were under Baranov cannot be established, but by 1802 the number may have been less than a hundred. In 1795, Baranov had reported to Shelikhov that he had at his disposal only 152 men, but many of these were looking to return to Russia (letter to Shelikhov and Polevoi, May 20, 1795, in Tikhmenev 1979: 60-61). Of these, at least eighty-two were stationed in the Kodiak Archipelago (the number of signatories to a petition by veteran promyshlenniki who came to Kodiak in 1784 protesting the unfair division of furs; see Russian-American Company 1976:85-86). Archimandrite Ioasaf, responding to an inquiry from the synod of the Orthodox Church, reported in 1797/1798 a total of 225 persons. This figure included the clergy and Lebedev-Lastochkin men (Bolotov, n.d.).</p>
	
	<p>Vessels arriving from Okhotsk once a year brought reinforcements, sometime as few as twenty-six men, sometimes more than a hundred. On the return voyage, the vessels carried men who had quit company service, retirees, and the sick. According to Baranov, he had twenty-five Russians plus fifty-five Alaska Natives in the hunting party (letter to Rodionov, May 14, 1800, in section 5 of this volume). No figures for those departing Alaska are to our knowledge available. Svetlana Fedorova (1971:112-13) noted the difficulty in computing the number of Russians in Alaska for this period, a fact, she remarks, noticed even earlier by Tikhmenev (1861-63:36). Even though he did receive reinforcements in 1802, that Baranov’s Russian contingent was seriously depleted is attested to by Baranov’s address to his men of February 15, 1803. In this address (included in section 7 of this volume), Baranov, in essence, drew the line in the sand, asking those willing to stick with him to sign on one side of a document and those unwilling to continue, on the other. As an inducement, he offered his men the opportunity to become shareholders in the newly formed Russian-American Company (1976:151-55, document 10).</p>
	
	<p>We note also that this small number of able-bodied Russian men was manning at least eleven outposts in the Kodiak Archipelago and up to fifteen elsewhere, not counting Sitka, Unalaska, and the Pribilof Islands but including: Katmai, Sutkhum on the Alaska Peninsula, Lakes Iliamna and Clark, three outposts on the Kenai Peninsula (Cook Inlet shore), Resurrection Bay, Cape St. Elias (St. Simeon Redoubt), Montague Island, Nuchek (Hinchinbrook Island) in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Prince William Sound</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>, Delarov Harbor on Unga Island in the Shumagins, and Sanak Island, the easternmost and sea-otter rich island of the Aleutian Chain. Baranov’s forces were indeed thinly stretched. Very few men manned some posts; other outposts had substantial garrisons. The main concentration was on Kodiak and at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>, with Katmai a strong third. Additional men were needed as crews on vessels serving Baranov locally.</p>
	
	<p>There were Russians stationed in Unalaska and in the Pribilofs, but they were not under Baranov’s jurisdiction. After Shelikhov’s death in 1795, his companies were reorganized, and in 1797 one of the new partners, Emel’ian Larionov, was appointed to Alaska. He took charge of Unalaska District, and Baranov deferred to him. However, the situation soon changed.</p>
	
	<p>On September 13, 1803 the Sv. Aleksandr Nevskii, a two-masted, 115-ton vessel built in Okhotsk in 1801, navy navigator Efim Petrov commanding, arrived at Kodiak. She brought few supplies and few men, but on October 31, 1803, the newly built Sv. Zakharii i Elizaveta (in literature referred to simply as the Elizaveta), a two-masted vessel of 150 tons commanded by Lt. Nikolai Khvostov, arrived with reinforcements. Baranov now had an additional 120 men at his disposal. Moreover, the Elizaveta brought a copy of Baranov’s appointment as general manager of all company establishments, with the exception of the Atka District, which was under the company’s Okhotsk office jurisdiction (the original, sent in 1799, was lost in the wreck of the Feniks [Phoenix]). Baranov immediately requested that men from Unalaska District be sent to him. The Unalaska reinforcements sent in 1803 and 1804 numbered thirty-eight men (Khlebnikov 1979:106). </p>
	
	<p>The Elizaveta sailed back to Okhotsk on June 25, 1803. Khvostov carried with him Baranov’s report dated June 20, 1803, about the destruction of the Old Sitka fort. Unfortunately, neither this document nor a copy of it has been found. The main office in St. Petersburg deemed this report insufficient, and on April 29, 1805, ordered Baranov to investigate more thoroughly the causes of the attack by a “mob of Americans [Natives);” (see Russian-American Company 1976:163, document 13, included in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>).</p>
	
	<p>In the meantime, preparations for immediate return to Sitka began. Kuskov urged caution, and Baranov heeded his advice. The attack was planned for spring 1804. By 1804 Baranov’s fleet consisted of the company vessels the Sv. Ekaterina, Sv. Aleksandr Nevskii, Sv. Petr i Pavel, and the two vessels built at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Yakutat</a>, the Ermak and the Sv. Rostislav. Sea-otter hunting parties of four hundred baidarkas were commanded by Kuskov, Timofei Dem’ianenkov, and Mikhail Bakadarov. This contingent mustered nine hundred men led by thirty-eight Native leaders (toions). The Natives were issued as many firearms as were available, but the majority was armed with spears and bows and arrows. They sailed into <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> territory at various times during August 1804. According to Iurii Lisianskii (1812:2:15), by the time they assembled in Sitka Sound, at Krestovskaia Gavan; they had lost one hundred men to various causes.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov sailed on the Ermak to Lynn Canal and to the Bay of Sea Otters (Bucareli Bay). As the Russians passed the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> villages, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> population went into hiding. Kake and Kuiu were burned in retaliation for the killing of the Urbanov party in 1802. By September 8 the vessels and the hunting parties began to arrive at Krestovskaia in Sitka Sound, where, to their surprise and great joy, Baranov found the navy ship Neva, Iurii Lisianskii commanding, awaiting his arrival (Khlebnikov 1973:44-46). The battle for Sitka of 1804 was about to begin.</p>
	
	<p>The Neva was one of the two Russian naval ships that sailed around the world in 1803, by an agreement with the Russian-American Company, under the overall command of Iu. F. Kruzenshtern (Krusenstern), out of Kronstandt (Gulf of Finland). The two vessels separated in Hawaii. Kruzenshtern made for Kamchatka, and from there, with N. P. Rezanov, an official of the Russian-American Company designated by Emperor Alexander I as ambassador, on to Japan, then to Nagasaki, and back to Kamchatka. Lisianskii’s mission was to investigate the situation in Russian America and render aid if needed. The eminent historian of Russian America, Richard A. Pierce, maintains that the two navy commanders learned about the destruction of Old Sitka in 1802 when in Hawaii, between June 8 and 20, 1804 (Pierce 1990b:312). It is certain, though, that Lisianskii learned the details in Kodiak, where he arrived on July 10, 1804. By that time Baranov was away, sailing in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> waters on his mission of revenge.</p>
	
	<p>Leaving Kodiak on August 15, Lisianskii hastened to Sitka Sound, where he waited for Baranov at Krestovskaia Gavan’ for over a month, until September 19. As Baranov’s fleet arrived one by one at this rendezvous point, Lisianskii assumed overall command of the vessels, except for Baranov’s personal vessel, the Ermak. However, apparently not all of Baranov’s fleet took part in the battle. The whereabouts of the Sv. Petr i Pavel is uncertain. Also uncertain is the role of the American trader O’Cain, commanded by Joseph O’Cain, with part-owners Jonathan Winship Jr. and his brother Nathan Winship on board, who served as first and chief mates, respectively. A few words about O’Cain are in order.</p>
	
	<p>Irish-born Joseph O’Cain appears on the Northwest Coast as a navigator on various ships prior to 1802. As his first major venture, he sailed from Massachusetts for the Pacific in January 1803, in command of the O’Cain, a newly built ship named for him and owned by the Winship family.</p>
	
	<p>Having noted the diminishing trading stock of sea otter pelts on the Northwest Coast due to the pressures of intensive hunting and fierce competition, O’Cain pioneered the concept of using Alaska Native labor to hunt <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">sea otters</a> directly, poaching in Spanish territory, with its extensive sea otter population, which neither the Spaniards nor the California Natives harvested. O’Cain arrived at Kodiak in October 1803 and negotiated with Baranov, who gave him forty Aleut hunters in twenty baidarkas for the California hunt. They would split the furs fifty-fifty.</p>
	
	<p>With 1,100 hunted pelts and additional pelts illegally traded in California, O’Cain returned to Sitka in June 1804, presumably to settle up with Baranov, before sailing to China to sell his share and then continue home. In this context we meet O’Cain in Sitka, where Baranov and Lisianskii are poised to recapture the territory and reestablish Russian control (Howay 1973:55, 57; Malloy 1998:100, 137-38). Thus, the O’Cain was in Sitka Sound at the time of Lisianskii’s arrival and remained for at least part of the hostilities, after which O’Cain sailed for China. He reached Canton in 1804. Under the command of Jonathan Winship, the O’Cain made two subsequent trips to California in partnership with Baranov, in 1806 and 1810.</p>
	
	<p>After Baranov’s arrival, the two leaders acted in concert against the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, Lisianskii’s crew of forty-two men and officers (including Lisianskii) constituting a substantial reinforcement. Unfortunately, we were unable to locate any documentary evidence as to the number of Russian promyshlenniki that participated in the 1804 battle under Baranov. </p>
	
	<p>Grinev (1999b:72) gives a figure of 120 men, but without source citation or explaining the basis for this figure, if calculated. According to Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff (1993:2:46), the Aleksandr and the Ekaterina carried 58 men, the Neva, 54, and the Ermak, 15, for a total of 127. We note that Langsdorff omits in his calculations the Rostislav, the smallest vessel of Baranov’s fleet, needing a crew of no more than seven to nine men. Langsdorff’s data, if obtained in Alaska, was derivative and secondhand, and he did not speak Russian. Khlebnikov, whose account we cite in this volume, does not report the number of Russians, but speaks of Alutiiq war leaders, specifically naming Nankuq from the Akhiok-Aiaktalik area whose portrait (along with Kalyaan’s) was painted by Tikhanov in 1818. Khlebnikov also reports casualties on both the Russian and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> sides. We shall return to this point below, discussing when warfare ceased and normal relations were reestablished, and the losses on both sides were calculated on the basis of two factors: the number of killed (and wounded) and the rank of those who died.</p>
	
	<p>Captain Lisianskii, commander of the Neva, and, after Baranov, probably the main participant in the battle of 1804, kept meticulous records and published a detailed account of the preparations for the battle, the battle itself, and its immediate aftermath. This account is known in three versions: the original, published by Lisianskii at his own expense in 1812 in Russian; the English language edition of 1814; and the 1947 Russian edition, published by the Soviet regime. Of the three, we find the 1812 version to be the most detailed and the 1947, the most deficient. The latter (Stalinist censored) version contains many omissions and inserts as well as “corrections” in comparison to the 1812 original. The 1814 English translation omits much information that Lisianskii presumably considered of no interest to English readers, but which we consider very important to readers interested in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> history and culture. In <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a> we present a new English translation by Lydia Black that follows the 1812 text, selecting the parts dealing with the 1804 battle and pertinent <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> material.</p>
	
	<p>It appears that the Sitkans expected Baranov to return. Sometime after the battle of 1802, Chief Shk’awuyeil built a refuge fort at Indian River (called Kaasdaheen in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>). The name of the fort in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> is Shis ‘~i Noow, from the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> word shfs’ls., variously translated as “young tree” or “green wood” (Alex Andrews 1960; Johnson n.d.; Hopkins 1958; Jacobs 1990:4 and this volume). Surrounded by a stout palisade protected by cannons, the fort had a pit in the center where women and children could find shelter from enemy fire.</p>
	
	<p>When Lisianskii and then Baranov’s fleet arrived, the Castle Hill site (Noow Tlein in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>) was already abandoned. Baranov immediately took possession. The Natives under Baranov’s command spent a night in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> houses and then the village was burned.</p>
	
	<p>Before actual hostilities commenced, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> war canoe, carrying powder and munitions obtained by K’alyaan at Nass River (A. Andrews 1960), and manned by young aristocrats, blew up. A careless handling of a firearm had resulted in a spark that ignited an open powder cask. Lisianskii’s sailors picked up the survivors. Later they were taken to Kodiak as hostages (see Lisianskii, A. Andrews, A. P. Johnson, and S. Hopkins, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). The explosion of the canoe is a major motif in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral accounts and remains a central image in the Sooxsaan song, a Kiks.ádi ceremonial lamentation sung to the present day. It is one of several dramatic moments on which the Russian written and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral accounts agree.</p>
	
	<p>The second Battle of Sitka began at the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> Fort on Indian River, on October 1, 1804 (Gregorian calendar), and did not result in a decisive victory for either side. Both sides took casualties. The Russians lost ten, among them three sailors from the Neva, three promyshlenniki, and four Alutiit; there were twenty-four wounded. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> casualties were higher; after the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> abandoned the fort, the Russians found thirty bodies outside the walls.</p>
	
	<p>The Russians suffered casualties when they attempted to storm the fort by wading to the beach through shallow water. According to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition, they were attacked from the flank by a party led by Kalyaan from underwater. He was wearing the Kiks.ádi Raven battle helmet, and his weapon was the hammer taken from the blacksmith in 1802. We do not know if any <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> died in the underwater attack on the Russian landing party, or, if so, if any bodies were carried out to sea. This would have been very painful as, according to Kenneth Austin, contrary to the usual written observations where the victors and the losers took a count of their losses and then either killed warriors or made payments to balance the battle losses, sometimes the defeated were treated otherwise. That is the victors took the defeated warriors’ bodies and instead of cremating them on the battle field as was the custom, they tossed them into the water (loss of body and soul). The purpose of this act was to humiliate the survivors and not to castigate the dead, who were destined to travel to Kiwa.aa or Kiwakaawu Aani, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> afterworld up in the sky where those who died in battle and who were murdered became the gis’oals. (northern lights) and there eternally played games of sport (1999:68).</p>
	
	<p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> elder Alex Andrews suggests that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> planned to cremate the bodies of slain Russian and Alutiiq warriors, as was the custom (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1990:8). However, cremation obviously was prevented, in both the 1802 and 1804 battles. According to Amvrosii Plotnikov, who survived the battle of 1802, at his request, Captain Barber, an English fur trader, took him to Old Sitka at least eight days after the battle. The bodies, all except one (Kabanov’s) headless, were scattered around. Plotnikov and his companions buried them.</p>
	
	<p>By 1806, a grave marker with the names of those who perished at Old Sitka was erected by the Russians.</p>
	
	<p>We do not know if the thirty bodies the Russians found outside of the walls of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> fort on Indian River had their heads removed (a topic discussed below). One <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> narrator (Johnson) states that in 1804, the bodies of the slain Russians and their Native allies were stripped naked by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> women - a great indignity. There is also a suggestion that this happened in 1802 as well (Johnson, this volume). In 1804, bodies were returned to the Russians at Lisianskii’s request (Andrews, this volume).</p>
	
	<p>Russian sources state that to the very last, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> hoped for reinforcements from Angoon, but these did not materialize. By the evening of October 5, 1804, one of the toions gave the Russians to understand that they were ready to abandon the fort the next day (see Lisianskii’s account in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). The Russians expected the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> to leave by sea, but on the morning of October 7 found the fort and canoes abandoned. They were surprised to discover that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> had left by land.</p>
	
	<p>According to some accounts, small children and dogs had been killed lest they betray the march by crying or making other sounds.  The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> had fled during the night through the woods, not trusting the Russians’ sign of peace, the white flag. Was this one of the many failures in cross cultural communication, or was it a failure of the inept interpreters, or - even worse - an act of treachery and malice? The white flag motif appears in several oral and written accounts, but there is no consensus regarding what happened. The late Mark Jacobs Jr., a native of Angoon and almost lifelong resident of Sitka, was the keynote speaker at the Second International Conference on Russian America, Sitka, Alaska, August 19-22, 1987. He stated, “The white flags continued to fly. Then Daalnéix’, the self-appointed mediator, went to the [<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>l fort with a message stating that the white flag on board the ship meant that they [the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>l would be wiped out as clean as snow. This was frightening news … they decided to go overland” (Jacobs 1990:5, also this volume). The survival march overland to Peril Strait is a very important part of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition, especially of the Sitka Kiks.ádi. The organization, order of the march, and routes taken by various groups have been researched and reconstructed by the late Herb Hope, whose account is reproduced in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>.</p>
	
	<p>If the misunderstanding of the meaning of the white flag was shocking, ending in tragedy for the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> that left deep scars that hurt to this day, for the Russians (with the possible exception of Baranov and a few of the grizzled old-timers) the trauma was apparently in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> treatment of the dead bodies. This included decapitation, scalping, and stripping of the bodies of the fallen enemies. For the Russians, this was desecration of the dead, a vicious, unnecessary act, adding insult to injury. For the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, taking the heads and scalping were acts that marked the dead as warriors in the hereafter (see above). Austin (1999:69) writes, “The victors retrieved whole heads or scalps and, when occasion arose, the ashes of the enemy and their own dead warriors. … The heads of dead men of rank and valor were cut off and taken as mementos.” In short, it was an honor offered to a brave and important enemy.  </p>
	
	<p>Wars do end. Hostages were taken by the Russians in the course of the 1804 hostilities. Although both sides understood the taking of hostages and sought to take hostages of rank, the Russians did not comprehend that in some cases the taking of important hostages might be a preliminary for formally ending hostilities. This certainly was the case with Lisianskii when, leaving for Kodiak on November 10, 1804, he carried away the four captives who survived the canoe explosion and a number of hostages delivered by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> during the parleys prior to and in the course of the conflict, and during its immediate aftermath. Among the latter was a small son of an important <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader who conducted peace negotiations in 1805.</p>
	
	<p>Peace overtures were made by Baranov and by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>, although oral testimonies stress that the peace initiative rested with the Russians. This interpretation permitted the oft-repeated statements that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> were, when all was said and done, the victors. Themes of war and peace dominate the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral traditions and are also reflected in some Russian documents.</p>
	
	<p>News of the Russian victory quickly spread. A celebration was held in Kodiak on November 21, 1804. This is described in a letter of June 1805 to Metropolitan Amvrosii from Hieromonk Gideon, who had reached Kodiak in July 1804.</p>
	
	<p>On the 21st of November the Russian-American Company decreed a celebration to be held to mark the successful taking ofthe <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> [Kolosh] fort to [sic] Sitkha on Baranov Island and incorporation of these localities under the Scepter of the Russian Empire. After the Liturgy, a thanksgiving prayer service [blagodarstvennyi moleben] was offered to All- Bountiful God for the health of His Imperial majesty and of the entire August House. The day before, a panikhida [service for the dead] was held for all those killed at the storming of the fortress, ten men in all, that is three sailors from the ship Neva, three Russian promyshlennye, and four Kad’iak Aleuts. The wounded were Manager Baranov, Lieutenant Povalishin, the assistant surgeon [podlekar’], assistant navigator [podshturman] , quartermaster, a cannoneer, eight sailors, and seven promyshlennye (Gideon 1989:74).</p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">And life goes on: 1805-1806, 1818</a></h4><h5><i>Peacemaking; the Kiks.ádi return to Sitka</i></h5>
	
	<p>The Sitka Kiks.ádi found a new home on the point where Peril and Chatham Straits converge. They established several small settlements and a large fort in a good defensive location, described in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> accounts and in accounts by Langsdorff and D’Wolf, all included in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>. In the meantime, Baranov, with 110 Russians and 700 Alaskans, having burnt the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> dwellings, food supplies, and gravesites (except one, the sarcophagus of a brother of a friendly <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader), proceeded to build New Sitka with all possible speed. When Lisianskii stopped at Sitka in late June 1805 on the way to Canton, he was very impressed with Baranov’s progress, remarking, “During our brief absence he managed to construct eight buildings that in their appearance and size [would) be considered handsome even in Europe” (1812:112; Arndt and Pierce 2003:10-12). The Sitkans, of course, had relocated to the newly constructed fortified village described above, called Chaatlk’aanoow (A. Andrews).</p>
	
	<p>Small groups of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> occasionally reconnoitered, and a Native who strayed from the fort was killed. But by and large, the Alutiit fished for food without hindrance, and no major confrontations developed. There was nevertheless a food shortage, that ended in March with the herring run (Baranov to Kulikalov, April 29, 1805, in Tikhmenev 1979:140-43, document 36, included in this volume). Russian and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> accounts suggest that both sides spent the winter of 1804-05 scouting each other and making peace overtures. Peace was made in the summer of 1805. No explicit dates are given in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral accounts, but all deal with peacemaking as described by Lisianskii.</p>
	
	<p>The Neva returned from Kodiak June 21, 1805 and stayed until August 20 (or 24) (see Khlebnikov 1973:50 and Lisianskii 1812, in this volume). It was during this period that the peacemaking, or “deer” ceremony was held, and peace was concluded between the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> and Russians. According to Austin, this ceremony was held in ancient times only in the wake of international conflicts that seriously disturbed the order of life. In Austin’s opinion, the Russian-<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> conflict fit into this category. Austin says, “In essence, this ceremony was the religious and final phase of the disputants’ attempt to restore secular lawful relationships” (1999:19). The process was lengthy, beginning with complex negotiations and hostage exchanges, restitution (including gift exchange), and, finally, the peace dance. “Upon completion of negotiations after a battle, the peace ceremony called guwakaan by Southeast Alaska Indians was put into play to put an official end to a war” (1999:64-65). Guwakaan is the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> word for “deer;” an animal used as a symbol of peace. By extension, the word is applied as a term for hostages exchanged in the context of peacemaking, and may also be understood and translated as the title “peacemaker” (see also 1999:97). “The peace dance of the deer ritual validated the negotiations that resulted in an equitable peace settlement” (1999:107). </p>
	
	<p>Baranov, who knew the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> customs, had conducted negotiations throughout the winter, but the expected approach of the fort by <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders did not materialize. Utilizing the occasion of the Neva’s arrival, Baranov promptly dispatched a messenger to the Sitka <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> now living near Chatham Strait, across from Angoon (Lisianskii 1812:114). This is confirmed by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition. One narrator, the Kiks.ádi historian A. P. Johnson, describes in detail how Baranov was forced to sue for peace. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> responded that another embassy was necessary, and Baranov complied. The next day, people were sent to the Sitkans with gifts and stayed four days (a ritual number).</p>
	
	<p>We can assume that ceremonial oratory was exchanged, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral tradition preserves memory of this in the speeches delivered between Kalyaan and the Russian envoy as described by Herb Hope in his paper on the Kiks.ádi survival march, reprinted in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>. As an elder of the Point House, he transmitted traditions received from his departed maternal uncles. On July 16, a Sitka leader who, according to Khlebnikov, was Kalyaan’s brother, Saiginakh, “was entertained in a kindly fashion by Baranov in the fort” (1973:50). </p>
	
	<p>Lisianskii describes the ceremonial approach of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> delegation, although the captain failed to grasp the cultural and political significance of the unfolding events and was at times impatient with them. It was, without doubt, the guwakaan that he witnessed: the two <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> canoes approached abreast and the men sang. Their heads were covered with eagle down. When the canoes were near shore, the leader sang and danced, holding an eagle tail in each hand.</p>
	
	<p>On Baranov’s orders, the Alutiit and the Chugach, dressed in their best and also with heads covered in down, singing and dancing, met the T1ingit and carried the leader to his assigned place on a rug. His companions were also carried ashore on the shoulders of the Alutiit, but without rugs.</p>
	
	<p>The next day, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> delegation that included the to ion’s son-in-law and his daughter visited the Neva, where Lisianskii entertained them, but, unlike Baranov, without observance of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> customs, although there was oratory and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> danced. The delegation stayed eight days, a ritual number associated with the “deer” ceremony.</p>
	
	<p>As a parting gift, Baranov gave the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader a Russian crest decorated with eagle feathers and ribbons. This ceremonial gift is mentioned by Jacobs Jr., who states that now it is in the Alaska State Museum in Juneau (Jacobs 1990:6, also this volume; see also photo in this volume). Lisianskii also mentions that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader exchanged his elder son, yet a boy, who was being held by the Russians, for the younger one. Exchanges of important hostages who might have been considered “deer” (peace hostages) is, according to Austin, also a part of the ceremony.</p>
	
	<p>The second visit by important <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders occurred on July 28, 1805, this time led by Kalyaan himself, with an eleven-man retinue. Gifts were exchanged, Kalyaan’s canoe was carried ashore by Baranov’s men, and Baranov and Lisianskii visited Kalyaan in the place where Baranov housed him, following <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition in peace negotiations. Lisianskii says that this delegation was more richly dressed than the first one, but that their heads, too, were covered with eagle down. According to Lisianskii, the delegation stayed at the fort six days, dancing every day (from July 29 to August 2).</p>
	
	<p>Lisianskii is the only eyewitness who described young Kalyaan’s physical appearance and attire: “Katleyan wore a shirt-like garment of blue worsted, and over it an English flannel robe. On his head he wore a hat of black foxes, tails up. He is of middle height and has a rather pleasant face, a small black beard and mustache. He is considered the best shot. He keeps with him up to twenty fine guns” (1812:129).  This description should be compared with the portrait of Kalyaan painted in 1818 by Mikhail Tikhanov, staff artist aboard the Kamchatka, commanded by V. M. Golovnin (see color plate 9, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). </p>
	
	<p>Apparently, an important <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader chosen as “deer” remained in the fort. Lisianskii who, as mentioned earlier, did not understand the symbolic significance of the events and actions, thought that he was being elected to replace Kalyaan (1812:131). His description, however, suggests that this was not the case:</p>
	
	<p>He was so mindful of his dignity that he never walked anywhere, even for needed matters. Others always had to carry him on their shoulders. If none of our Americans were on hand, he forced his own Sitkans to do so. But at the same time, he danced and made various gestures along with his subordinates. A place was reserved for these entertainments near the gravesite of his brother that was the only one remaining whole. As this toion on every occasion showed his care for and friendliness toward Russians, Baranov hung a bronze crest on him (1812:131). </p>
	
	<p>Clearly, Lisianskii’s account is incomplete; many features of the ceremony were either not witnessed, unreported, or largely misunderstood. To flesh out the events, we must turn to the testimony of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> elders: Sally Hopkins, Alex Andrews, Mark Jacobs Jr., and A. P. Johnson. According to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> tradition, the peace negotiations and peace ceremony were organized with the help of Naaweiyaa, a Kaagwaantaan who lived at Gasda~ei~da.aan (Alex Andrews, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). </p>
	
	<p>Andrews says, “Things were made good with the Russians .... Things improved, then the deer ceremony was made with them … The Russians then became our relatives. They became relatives of the Kiks.ádi” (this volume, lines 692-93, 706-7, 714-15). He also mentions Kooxx’áan (line 711), a well-attested name inherited by successive generations of leaders, most recently by Andrew Ebona, leader of the Kiks.ádi Copper Shield House (Tinaa Hit). At the end of the peace ceremony, the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> formally transferred Castle Hill and its vicinity to Baranov. Jacobs (1990:5, and in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>) states, “It was at this peace treaty that the present Castle Hill was given to Baranov in exchange for a double-headed eagle badge, which is depicted on the totem pole. It was explained to mean, ‘From now on and forever, we will be brothers. You look one way and we the other way: The round knob on the bottom of the totem represents Castle Hill, the only piece of real estate ever given to the Russians.” </p>
	
	<p>A. P. Johnson is more precise: “The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> gave the Russians – the Russian government – a line running from where the cold storage store used to be, a straight line running right into the lake, Swan Lake, and on towards Sheldon Jackson College, a line running from there on to the lake. [Everything] in between that land is given to the Russian government free of charge. … They built a heavy fence around it. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> call it ‘noow: the stockade:’ (Johnson n.d., lines 1359-75, in this volume). Sally Hopkins, however, speaks in general terms about Russians giving specific at.60w in payment for the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> dead. </p>
	
	<p>The sails of the Neva had scarcely disappeared beyond the horizon when the Juno, out of Bristol, Rhode Island, arrived in Sitka Sound. She was commanded by John D’Wolf, on his first voyage to the Northwest Coast. He traded for furs off Vancouver Island and in the Queen Charlotte Islands, and then sailed northward into Alaska waters. He dropped anchor in Magee’s Harbor on the west side of Sitka Sound on May 9, 1805. He wrote that here they found a “guide-post, pointing out the direction to the village;’ and were soon visited, first by Kodiak Islanders in their baidarkas and then by Abraham Jones, an American employee of the Russian-American Company. D’Wolf then visited Baranov, with Jones interpreting. He met Baranov, whom he liked very much, and stayed in the harbor until May 27, 1805. He then traded in Chatham Strait, Lynn Canal, and once again off Vancouver Island, where he met several American merchantmen, among them the Atahualpa, and learned that this vessel had been attacked by the Natives, her captain and all officers killed. By July, Sitka Sound seemed a much more attractive trading ground, and he again set course in that direction. He was at Point Retreat in Lynn Canal (near modern day Juneau) when he met armed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> in great numbers and decided to leave. By August 5, 1805, D’Wolf was in Chatham Strait, where on the tenth his vessel was damaged after striking a rock. But he managed to reach Novoarkhangel’sk, where he then pleasantly spent about a year ([1861]1968:20-21, 23, 27-28).</p>
	
	<p>On August 26, the Sv. Mariia Magdalina, commanded by Lt. Andrei Mashin, with Lt. Nikolai Khvostov, midshipman Gavriil Davydov, Russian-American Company official N. P. Rezanov, and his personal physician Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff aboard, put into the port of Novoarkhangel’sk. Langsdorff, who did not speak Russian but was fluent in English, soon lodged and made friends with D’Wolf, who reported, “As I lived under the same roof with him, we became almost inseparable, participating both in each other’s pleasure and troubles” (D’Wolf [1861]1968:39).</p>
	
	<p>It is instructive to compare accounts of the Russian settlement in Sitka scarcely a year after it was wrested from the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>. Langsdorff found fault with everything: instead of the splendid buildings described by Lisianskii he saw only miserable ‘shacks, no healthy food whatsoever, and miserable people. No “normal human conveniences” were to be expected (1993:2:48). Langsdorff is highly unreliable in many respects. For example, recounting the battles over Sitka, about which of course he learned secondhand at best, he states that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>’ ultimate defeat hinged, among other things, upon “their fear of firearms” (1812:2:95), while D’Wolf wrote that “Both sexes are expert in the use of fire-arms, and are excellent judges of their quality” ([1861] 1968:48). The American historian Bancroft ([1886] 1970:442) characterized Langsdorff as follows: “As a savant he was superficial; as a chronicler he was biased. In neither capacity does he add much to what was already known of Russian America:’ Even harsher words are contained in his lengthy footnote.</p>
	
	<p>D’Wolf, on the other hand, admired the Russians’ fortitude in the face of adversity, and their skills in fishing, hunting, and especially house construction and ship building. He stated that in the fall of 1805, the population of Novoarkhangel’sk numbered 150 Russians and about 250 Alaska Natives. Langsdorff (1812:2:77) says that the total population, counting everyone, including persons of high rank, was less than two hundred. Most were engaged in construction: “They built log-houses, workshops, and barracks” (D’Wolf [1861]1968:40). From both sources we learn that within a year following the Battle of Sitka of 1804, relations between the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> and the Russians were returning to normal, apparently on individual bases. Mrs. Amvrosii Plotnikov, the TIingit woman married to 1802 survivor Amvrosii Plotnikov, rejoined her husband and regularly visited her father, who lived along Peril Strait. The former <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> residents of Sitka were visiting NovoarkhangeI’sk, supplying the settlement with fish, and bartering for shirts and other items. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leaders often visited the Russian fort on Castle Hill (Langsdorff 1993:2:52, 62-63).</p>
	
	<p>In November 1805 (according to the “old” or Julian calendar, but for D’Wolf, using the Gregorian calendar, October 26) (Langsdorff 1812:2:102), Langsdorff and D’Wolf went on a visit to the Sitkans now living near Chatham Strait, also described in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> oral accounts in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>. They traveled in baidarkas provided by Baranov and manned by Alutiiq paddlers, and were accompanied by a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> woman interpreter. She lived at NovoarkhangeI’sk with her husband, and visited her father along Peril Strait settlement frequently. D’Wolf and Langsdorff agree that she was “ ... a daughter of one of the principal chiefs ... and had lived with the Russians five or six years:’ (D’Wolf [1861]1968:41-42). In the absence of other evidence, we assume that this woman was Mrs. Amvrosii Plotnikov, but other possibilities cannot be excluded, as more than one Russian at Old Sitka is said to have been married to a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> woman.</p>
	
	<p>D’Wolf’s account is concise, focusing on essential points. Langsdorff’s is very detailed, but sometimes his geographic descriptions are difficult to understand. Nevertheless, we can trace their general route from Sitka to the retreat site. It took the party three days to reach the village, which they did late on an inclement night. They traveled around Mt. Edgecumbe and to the Bay of Islands (modern Salisbury Sound)  and then through a narrow channel northeast (Peril Strait) and somewhere along this difficult passage stayed the night. Here a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> party, including a chief, his wife, and several adherents, came to visit, erecting a makeshift camp (Langsdorff 1812:2: 103-4).</p>
	
	<p>On October 27 they fought against the wind and currents and were forced to stop, apparently on the shore of Chichagof Island. There they found a single <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> dwelling, where they were received in a friendly fashion and spent the night. According to Langsdorff, the inhabitants numbered somewhere between twelve and fifteen persons. The next day they visited yet another small <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> settlement located a short distance away along the same shore. This was the dwelling place of a chief, identified by the two Europeans as Schinchetaez.  Reportedly, he was a chief who had been friendly toward the Russians from the very beginning and who had opposed the commencement of hostilities. According to Langsdorff, Schinchetaez had, by his stand, incurred the hatred of other <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> and was now forced to live apart accompanied only by his kin. </p>
	
	<p>Late on the third day, well into the inclement night, the party reached the Sitka <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> stronghold at Chatham Strait. They were met by over a hundred armed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a>, and expected the worst. Instead, they were received in friendship. Here the Europeans met their interpreter’s father, a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> leader they identify as Dlachaetin (D’Wolf [1861] 1968) or Dlchaetin (pronounced “Dlkhaetin") (Langsdorff 1812), and they gave presents to him and his wife. They were also invited to visit the head of the settlement, who gave them as a gift a sea otter skin. The next day, the visit was repeated, and the Europeans presented gifts to the chief.</p>
	
	<p>Of interest is the description of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> fort. According to Langsdorff, it was located across Chatham Strait from Angoon, on the northeast headland off the mouth of the channel through which the European party had passed. The modern name for the site is Point Craven, where Peril Strait meets Chatham Strait (Jacobs 1990:5; see also Herb Hope’s description of the retreat march, both in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>).</p>
	
	<p>The fort stood on a rock, “which rose perpendicularly to the height of several hundred feet above the water’s edge. The only possible access to it was on the northwest side, and here it was rendered extremely difficult by large trunks of trees over it” (D’Wolf [1861]1968:46). The fort was invisible from the seaside, sheltered by a natural earth outcropping. It was surrounded by a double palisade, from twelve to fifteen feet high and four feet thick. The houses were inside the palisade, in regular rows, each housing a headman and his kin, the average number of housemates being up to forty or so persons. Langsdorff (1812, vol. 2:111) estimated that the entire population of the fort numbered from 1,300 to 1,400 persons. The two visitors and their escort left after a stay of a few days, and were back at Sitka in the first days of November.</p>
	
	<p>All available evidence shows that by 1818 the peace between the Kiks.ádi and the Russians had become firm.  Life, evidently, was more or less peaceful in the vicinity of the Russian settlement. By the time of the June 1810 visit to Novoarkhangel’sk by the Russian navy sloop Diana (Y. M. Golovnin commanding), the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> were utilizing their ancient fishing grounds near Sitka (see Golovnin’s chart, reproduced in this volume). The Alutiit traveled over forty verst away from the town to hunt sea mammals, and a <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> settlement came into being near the hot springs. When Golovnin came to visit, the inhabitants had left, to the captain’s great disappointment (Golovnin 1864:75). Slowly, the Sitkans were returning to their ancestral home grounds.</p>
	
	<p>Golovnin visited Sitka a second time in August 1818, this time in command of the Kamchatka and armed with governmental authorization to remove Baranov from Alaska. By this time, two <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> kin groups had reestablished habitations near Novoarkhangel’sk itself, and “were in friendship with company employees:’ They visited Golovnin’s ship several times, observing the customs of singing and dancing when coming aboard. Golovnin feasted the leaders and their wives in his cabin. Kalyaan himself visited Golovnin. They discussed the past, and, according to Golovnin, Kalyaan said that he never really wanted to fight the Russians, but had been forced to by his late uncle. By this time, Kalyaan wore a silver medal given to him by Baranov. Golovnin was rather skeptical, and noted that Baranov still kept Kalyaan’s brother as a hostage (Golovnin 1822, vol. 1:206). Aboard the Kamchatka was the talented artist Mikhail Tikhanov, the official staff artist of the expedition. He painted a portrait ofKalyaan, with his wife in the background (color plate 9, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>). There is a silver medallion extant in the Alaska State Museum in Juneau (color plates 14 and 15), and it is tempting to think of this as the actual medal given by Baranov and shown in the Tikhanov painting, but this cannot be confirmed. If not Kalyaan’s actual medal, it is the same kind of medal given to him by Baranov.</p>
	
	<p>Baranov was removed by Captain Hagemeister, on Golovnin’s orders, on January 11, 1818. Hagemeister took over as chief manager, and on November 27, against his wishes, Baranov unwillingly boarded the Kutuzov that was sailing for Russia where his activities in Alaska were to be investigated and he himself was to stand trial (Black 2004a:183-84, 191-92). Loved by some, and hated by others, Baranov was respected even by many old enemies. Even Kalyaan, now the head of all Sitkans, came to bid Baranov farewell. Baranov’s biographer, Kiril T. Khlebnikov, who witnessed the event, wrote, “Even the Kolosh [<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>] who had trembled before him, but respected his bold and decisive spirit, parted from him with a strange mixture of joy and sadness. The famed toen [leader] Kotleian, respected by Baranov for his intelligence and bravery, and who had harmed Baranov more than anyone by destroying the fort - even he appeared before him, and they made their peace” (1973:99).</p>
	
	<p>Baranov died at sea long before the ship reached Russia. An era had come to an end. By 1820, most of the Sitka <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> had returned to their ancestral home, and by 1822 the large <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> settlement along the shore, outside but under the shadow of the Castle Hill fort, now known as Katlian Street, was firmly established. </p>
	
	<h4><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Epilogue, October 2004</a></h4>
	
	<p><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> relations with newcomers in the balance of the Russian period in Alaska history (1805-67) and in the American period (from 1867 to the present) are far beyond the scope of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">this book</a>, but we can note here a few highlights, with suggestions for further reading. In the Russian period there was relatively little disruption of traditional <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> social order, language, or religion. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>s</a></a> and Russians remained at uneasy peace, with minor flare-ups now and then. The American period brought massive, unrelenting, and permanent disruption to traditional life through influx and settlement, with resulting economic, social, and emotional impacts that the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> people continue to struggle with today.</p>
	
	<p>As one of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> clan mothers recently remarked, the early twentieth century “wasn’t a good time to be <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a>.” Tuberculosis and other diseases wracked the population. The twentieth century was one of enduring struggle and activism. Landmarks include formation of the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Sisterhood and the fights for citizenship, voting rights, integration, land claims, access to traditional foods ("subsistence"), and schooling that is not only racially integrated but in which <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> language and culture are seriously recognized in the academic kindergarten-through-college canon.  </p>
	
	<p>The Baranov era in Alaska came to a close with his departure in 1818. The Russian-American period lasted until the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. The Russians have come and gone, but the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">Tlingit</a> people remain. Although the events of 1802 and 1804 happened two centuries ago, their social impact and memory continue to the present day and generation, as illustrated by some recent commemorations in Sitka.</p>
	
	<p>On July 19, 2003, the Peace Hat was welcomed home to Sitka. This remarkable at.óow  was commissioned by Baranov, but was not completed until the 1830s, when it was presented to the Kiks.ádi, possibly by Governor Ferdinand von Wrangell. Acquired by Lt. George Emmons in the late nineteenth century, the hat was repatriated as an object of cultural patrimony under the 1990  Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) from the American Museum of Natural History.  The catalog record by Emmons (AMNH-E/2308) describes it as follows: </p>
	
	<p>Brass hat made after the pattern of the native spruce root dancing hat. This is a historical piece and carries the stamp of the Russian factory, as it was made by the order of Baranoff, the first Russian Commander to establish forts or trade ports in South Eastern Alaska, and was presented to the head Chief Michael of the Sitka . . . </p>
