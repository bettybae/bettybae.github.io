<center><b>Nguyen Dinh Chieu (1822-1888), “Elegy for Those Who Fought Righteously at Can giuoc” (1861) </b></center><br><br>
The guns of the enemy have shaken the earth, and the sky has shown the will of the people. <br><br>
Ten years of your hardship in breaking the clods of your ricefields shall not be forgotten, and your fame shall rise like a cork.<br><br>
Your only battle against the French, although it resulted in defeat, shall nonetheless sound your renown like a rattle.<br><br>
I remember you in the past: <br><br>
You worked in loneliness to earn your living, and your only preoccupation was your poverty and misery.<br><br>
You were not accustomed to bows or horses, nor had you much of the habit of battlefields.<br><br>
The only things you knew were rice fields and water buffaloes. You lived according to the village’s customs.<br><br>
Digging, plowing, harrowing, replanting were your usual occupations.<br><br>
Shields, rifles, scimitars, flags -- you had never seen these with your own eyes.<br><br>
The sigh of the wind and the cry of the crane<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> held you breathless for more than ten months<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>. You were expecting news from the official army as one expects rain in the dry season.<br><br>
For three years<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a>, the stain spread and you resented the barbarians’ manners as much as the peasant resents grass.<br><br>
One day, you saw the white cloths<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> spread over hundreds of yards, and you wanted to drive forward to eat the enemies’ livers.<br><br>
Another day, you watched the smoke of their gunboats blacken the sky, and you wanted to surge out and bit their necks.<br><br>
Into this united and sumptuous kingdom, could you admit any foreigner to slay the snakes and hunt the deer?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a><br><br>
Under the brilliant light of the sun and the moon, how could you tolerate those who sold dog’s meat for lamb?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a><br><br>
You did not wait for an authority to summon you or to draft you: this time you decided to hack off the big fish.<br><br>
You did not even think of running away or of dodging your responsibilities; this time you decided to capture the tiger.<br><br>
Alas! <br><br>
You were not professional soldiers of the provincial militia nor of the capital’s guards, experienced in military life and training. You were but inhabitants of villages and hamlets turned partisans to serve the cause of righteousness.<br><br>
You did not wait until you had been thoroughly trained in the eighteen weapons of the military art. The ninety schemes of military tactics had never been demonstrated for your instruction.<br><br>
On your back, a shirt of cotton; you did not wait for holsters or cartridge belts.<br><br>
In your hands, a pointed stick; you did not ask for knives or helmets.<br><br>
The match for your gunpowder was made of straw; but this did not prevent you from successfully burning the missionary house.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> <br><br>
For a sword, you used your kitchen knife; yet you were able to behead the enemies’ lieutenant.<br><br>
Your officers were not compelled to beat the drums in order to urge you forward. You advanced on your own, clambering onto the barricades. You looked upon the enemy as if he did not exist.<br><br>
You were not frightened by the French who shot large and small bullets at you. You forced your way into their camp, risking your life as if you had no material body.<br><br>
Some you stabbed, some struck so eagerly that the French soldiers and their mercenaries lost heart.<br><br>
You screamed at the forefront, you shouted at the rear regardless of the enemies’ gunboats, their ships, or their rifles.<br><br>
You had hoped that your patriotism would serve your country forever. Who could have foreseen that your material body would betray you so soon.<br><br>
You had thought that your right conduct would earn you victory in the battlefields. Who could have predicted that the horse’s skin would so swiftly swathe your corpse.<br><br>
Now you have returned to the world of the dead for many hundred years; you did not wait for your sword to be suspended on your grave.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> <br><br>
On the Can giuoc river, the grass and the trees mark grief along many thousand miles.<br><br>
At the market of Truong binh<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a>, tears fall from young and aged faces.<br><br>
Had you been bandits or robbers, and therefore condemned to fight, this fate would have been acceptable.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a><br><br> 
Had you been deserters from your ranks while in charge of the guard of citadels or fortifications, and therefore condemned to redeem your misconduct, you would have deserved this destiny.<br><br>
But what you felt was that each foot of your land and each shoot of your vegetables, you owed to your king. Your talent must therefore benefit your country.<br><br>
For a bowl of rice and a cut of cloth - what is the matter with the enemies’ ancestors that they come and dispute them with us? <br><br>
Who causes all the difficulties to our mandarins and our troops that they must taste snow and lie on dew? <br><br>
Because of whom have our posts and forts been shattered, swaying in the rain and collapsing in the wind? <br><br>
What was the meaning of life when you were compelled to live with heretics<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> who threw away the incense burner, thrust off the reading stand? The spectacle enhanced your sadness.<br><br>
What was the meaning of life when you were impressed into the enemy militia and when you had to share their wine and nibble their bread. The situation only accentuated your shame.<br><br>
You preferred to die fighting the enemy, and return to our ancestors in glory rather than survive in submission to the Occidentals and share your miserable life with barbarians.<br><br>
O, now all is finished! <br><br>
The Lao ngo pagoda, through the five watches of the night, remains quiet and cold. You have entrusted the full moon with the care of the faithfulness of your heart.<br><br>
The military posts of the enemies from the Western Seas witnessed for one minute how you expressed your resentment. It is to be lamented that your unpropitious lot caused you to drift with the outflowing current.<br><br>
How mournful is an old mother weeping for her young son under the midnight lamp, its light flickering around the hut.<br><br>
How pitiful is a feeble wife in search of her husband; still she falters at the doorway though the sun has set.<br><br>
O, the smoke of your battle has already dissipated, but your right conduct shall be recorded for a thousand years.<br><br>
Let their generals and soldiers establish their camp on the Ben nghe river<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>, we shall see who is responsible for the clouds blackening all four horizons.<br><br>
Our ancestors and parents still live on the land of Dong nai<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>, we shall see who will be able to save the next generation.<br><br>
You are dead, but your debt to your country has been fully honored, and your reputation shall be praised by the whole population of the six provinces.<br><br>
You are dead, but temples and shrines have been erected for your cult, and your name shall be cherished by thousands of generations to come.<br><br>
You fought the enemy during your life. Now, dead, you continue your struggle by letting your souls follow and support our garrisons and troops. For ten regenerations, you have pledged revenge.<br><br>
You served your king during your life. Now, dead, you continue to serve him. The Imperial edict demonstrates it clearly and a simple word “recognition”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> suffices to compensate you for your noble deeds.<br><br>
The heroes’ tears shall not run dry, and we love you because you acted according to the will of Heaven and the people.<br><br>
The incense sticks burnt in memory of the partisans are the most fragrant, and we are grateful to you because you struggled for the king and for the land.<br><br>
O, mourn.<br><br><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>

<center><b>Phan Thanh Gian (1796-1867) and Truong Cong Dinh (d. 1864) “After the Peace Treaty” (1863)</b></center><br><br>
PHAN THANH GIAN’S LETTER<br><br>
Since the court has signed the peace treaty, the duty of officials is to call off their struggle. There is no reason for any exception to this rule. Loyalty and filial piety deserve equal praise, but both have limits not to be exceeded. To surpass these limits is as reprehensible as not to reach them. <br><br>
Were you able to return to the court’s territory the entire provinces of Bien hoa, Gia dinh, and Dinh Tuong, yours would be an unprecedented achievement deserving the gratitude of the country. But now, as the main army has been withdrawn, and as the commanders who had gone into hiding have been appointed by the court to various other posts, what can you achieve with only a very small number of troops? Do you really think that you will be able to launch a general offensive? Furthermore, will you even be able to retain your present positions? I am convinced that, clearly, it will be impossible. <br><br>
TRUONG CONG DINH’S REPLY<br><br>
The population of the three provinces would not accept the partition of its country. This was why it chose me as its military commander. We cannot now do other than that which we are doing because we are convinced that we are acting according to the will of the people and that of Heaven. We are therefore determined to give our lives to our struggle. We shall harass the enemy from the east, attack him from the west. We shall continuously fight the enemy, and we are convinced that, in the end, we shall overcome. As long as you speak of peace and surrender, we are determined not to obey the court’s orders. Given these circumstances, any cooperation between you and us will be impossible. We hope that you will not be surprised by our determination.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[1]</a><br><br> 

<b>Memories of the Ship-of-the-line Captain Rieuner about Phan Thanh Gian in September 1863 (September 1863)</b><br><br>
... “After spending four months with this noble old man, we had come to appreciate all his qualities from which we learned a lot. And coming back (from the embassy), we could still find him surprised by the twists and turns of this great crossing from the Chinese seas to Toulon, supported by his patriotic zeal and moved by the desire to serve his country ... <br><br>
We remember that three times, when the view was particularly great and splendid, around the Krakatow islands, near the Perim islet, and in the Messine strait ..., the ambassador, sitting, worried, close to us on the footbridge of the European steamboat, started conversations about the purpose of his mission. <br><br>
We dissuaded him of the illusions he could have regarding the transfer of our conquest, and we promised him that he would find in France the most friendly and benevolent welcome. We would then chat about the future of his motherland, the abilities of its inhabitants and the advantages that the people and the mandarins would receive from our civilization. More than any of his compatriots, he appreciated its value. And he always ended the conversation with these words: “We still have to wait, and until that time our two nations won’t be less than on good terms.” ...<br><br>
... The day of the arrival of the ambassador to Toulon, in September 1863, a rumor, published in the Belgian Independence and reproduced in all French newspapers claimed that the king Tu-Duc offered 85 million francs for the buyback of the three conquered provinces, while leaving us the port of Saigon. Our Minister of Finance, for whom the balance of the budget had become very difficult from the excessive expenses in Mexico, was, we can easily understand, the most favorable toward this proposition, which would be done in different terms by the ambassadors. A signed report, printed in 50 copies, had already been transmitted to the Emperor, his ministers and all the high dignitaries who were interested in the question. The author had the honor of developing the conclusions in front of the assembled Ministers; the Emperor even had approved them and the official press supported them. <br><br>
This statement, launched behind the back of the Governor General of Cochinchine, retained in Vichy because of his dilapidated health, was gaining popularity at the court. However, upon reading, it would lead every serious spirit indecisive and hostile toward its paradoxical argument. It was bad advice, given unconsciously maybe, and disguised with ideas that seem seducing by their originality. As soon as we learned about this report, we decided to fight it vigorously. But the most basic common sense indicated, of course, that it was not necessary to dress up all our government officials as Chinese mandarins after having laboriously informed them, at great expense, about the poor lettered background of the Celestial Empire, all this in order to be able to govern the population subject to our domination. Furthermore, the last words pronounced by the Emperor in response to the speech given by the first ambassador, were more severe in their translation. The Annamese, who have been waiting in anxiety for more than one month to be able to meet the Emperor, left shattered from the phrase that has been applied to their situation. They believed they had failed. The day after, they received the notice that the response to their mission will be sent to Hue within one year. At the same time, we asked them to communicate the propositions concerning the trade relations between the two nations. From this moment, their faces started to blossom. They understood that their departure could be achieved with a certain hope of success ...” <br><br> 

<center><b>Interview with Commandant Ansard & Phan Thanh Gian (Mytho, November 18, 1866)</b></center><br><br>
“Admiral, I have the honor to communicate to you the conversation I had with Phan Thanh Gian on the 16th when he was in Mytho on his way from Saigon to Vinhlong. At four o’clock in the evening, I brought Phan Thanh Gian to the kiosk in the garden, and there, when I had discharged all his staff, he started himself the conversation through the intermediary of Father Marc, and he asked me this question: “When are you going to take the three provinces.” I answered him that I knew nothing about that, and that before going farther I would have to remind him that I had no official power to answer similar questions and that if I accepted to continue this conversation, he should only understand from my speech my pure personal opinion, which could, in no case, be linked to the French government. <br><br>
He answered that he wanted to discuss with me as a friend, and he continued the conversation by asking me why we wanted to grab the three provinces: “Aren’t they yours, he asked me, and aren’t all the authorities aren’t working to satisfy the demands of the Governor? Don’t all the products of these provinces go to you? Don’t you have the key? Don’t you practice an almost sovereign authority, such that the fanatical party reproaches us at Court, calling us the slaves of the French?”’ I answered him that if the government was looking forward to possess the three provinces it could not only be for the purpose of territorial expansion, but also for a political necessity that he should understand better than me. <br><br>
He said to me: “What reason could the French government give to embellish this abuse of force since we won’t oppose this invasion with a resistance that we know to be useless? Did we fail in the last treaty? Haven’t all of the clauses on our side been implemented?” I reminded him not to forget the 1863 rebellion, incited by the Court of Hue at the exact same time when it was processing the peace treaty with Admiral Bonard. I reminded him of all the excitations related to the rebellions spread into the provinces by envoys who were clearly authorized, because if not, they wouldn’t have received the enthusiasm of the population. I reminded him of the attempts of Quan Dinh’s son, those of Tien-Ho, two chefs who found support, asylum and protection with them [the Court], and to whom the gangs are still making common cause with the Poukombo. Going back in history, I asked him how did the Hue Court consider the treaty of Louis XVI and how it did recognized the important services provided by Bishop Adran as well as the French officers who came to serve Gia-Long. The French government and all European governments in general now know that Asian governments think nothing of treaties made with Europeans, therefore we can’t believe anymore in the sincerity of these [Asian] governments without having material and palpable proofs. <br><br>
Phan Thanh Gian replied that the Annamese who supported the Poukombo were immoral people from both our provinces and their provinces, that since the Annamese have always defeated the Cambodians, that they [the Annamese] have despised them too much to follow them, furthermore we shouldn’t look for reproaches in history, that past was past, and that the previous faults of the Annamese government were born from ignorance of Europeans values and intelligence, but since today the two people know each other, the strongest has to provide the weakest its support and lights in order for him [the weakest] to enter the way of civilization. The treaty concluded between the French Emperor and Tu Du is not only a peace treaty, but also a friendship treaty that erases all the past, and, going back to its previous arguments, Phan Than Gian told me that Annamese did nothing in fact to break this treaty, but that however, on their side, the French did not effort to educate the Annamese on European sciences; and that despite this friendship treaty, they were leaving them rotting in their barbarism and ignorance, and even planned to grab without any motives three poor provinces. <br><br>
I answered to Phan Thanh Gian that we were doubting, until proven otherwise, of the sincerity of the Annamese government, that if we were to work to bring Annamese to join the civilized nations, we would have to fear that we could arm our own enemies, that we would never enter this path before having obvious proofs of their sincerity. <br><br>
Phan Thanh Gian then asked me what kind of proofs we would like in addition to the ones already made by the scrupulous enactments of the letter of the treaty.--I then answered him: ‘‘If, as you says, these three provinces are poor, if Hue acknowledges that they [these three provinces] are slaves and dependent on the French, wouldn’t it be better to get out from this false position, give up on these poor provinces, and on this base make a new treaty which would ratified and acknowledge this fact, that you admit you are accomplished? This voluntary handover of a territory which is at our mercy would be for the French government, I believe, a token of sincerity and rectitude of the Hue Court’s intentions. And I have no doubt that the French government would give up on its politic of distrust that had strongly weaken the Annamese government. On the contrary, it would have all the interest in the prosperity of a kingdom that genuinely became its friend; it would assume the tranquility and would prevent all the internal struggle, that you know are imminent, from going down under the Cambodian kingdom and to become an easy target for the first nation that would lust after it.’’ --- ‘‘But, answered Phan Than Gian, what I see from this are only expensive conditions for us, without serious and material compensation from you.’’ I replied: ‘‘Did you forget that Tonkin is in permanent state of insurrection, that revolt is never contained, never extinguished, that the day that we will throw there a handful of European soldiers and few weapons, the Annamese will lost this rich kingdom? Did you ignore that the Spanish wanted to grab it and that France never authorized that? Do you evaluate as nothing the rest of the war contribution that Tu Duc still has to pay us? Do you evaluate as nothing the repression of the piracy which destroy your shores and famish the Empire? Do you believe that the ships we use to purge the seas from these pirates don’t cost you anything and that their machines work without money? Now you see how much the poor boats you buy in Hong Kong cost you and calculate the sacrifices that we would have to do if your interests would come to join ours. Finally, think about it, if the French want the three provinces, they could take them using living force, without any of these serious compensations that would certainly be spared with another treaty.’’ <br><br>
Phan Thanh Gian honored me by saying that if a French officer has to ever live in Hue, he would wish it would be me. I recognized the compliment and answered: ‘‘Aubaret’’. He started to laugh, and since the dinner has been served, we left this conversation and the old mandarin, drowned his sorrow with wine, and returned to his boat stumbling on Father Marc’s arms ... ‘‘<br><br> 

<center><b>An Anonymous Appeal to Resist the French (1864) </b></center><br><br>
This is a general proclamation addressed to the scholars and the people.<br><br>
Our country is about to undergo dangerous upheavals.<br><br>
Certain persons are plotting treason.<br><br>
Our people are now suffering through a period of anarchy and disorder.<br><br>
That is but Heaven’s will.<br><br>
Nonetheless, even in times of confusion, there remain books that teach us how to overcome disorder.<br><br>
Past generations can still be for us examples of right and wrong.<br><br>
Intelligent persons should meditate on them with care.<br><br>
Were they illiterate or unintelligent, their ignorance would be forgivable.<br><br>
Do you not see that,<br><br>
When the Hsiung-nu attacked the Han, their officers were as strong as tigers, their soldiers numerous as grass? They seized passages, they held passes. But when the game was over, being nu they were again nu.<br><br>
Do you not observe that,<br><br>
When the T’u-chueh oppressed the T’ang, their elephants filled the mountains, their horses covered the highways. They besieged outposts in the north, they destroyed the ones in the east. But when the theater was removed, t’u, they resumed the nature of t’u.<br><br>
The Han succeeded in maintaining their unity.<br><br>
The T’ang territory was never divided.<br><br>
Let us now consider our situation with the French today.<br><br>
We are separated from them by thousands of mountains and seas.<br><br>
By hundreds of differences in our daily customs.<br><br>
Although they were very confident in their copper battleships surmounted by chimneys,<br><br>
Although they had a large quantity of steel rifles and lead bullets,<br><br>
These things did not prevent the loss of some of their best generals in these last years, when they attacked our frontier in hundreds of battles.<br><br>
The sun and the moon have always shown us the right way; shall we now suffer that a flock of birds come to sing and dictate our behavior?<br><br>
Our country has always been known as a land of deities; shall we now permit a horde of dogs and goats to stain it?<br><br>
The moral obligations binding a king to his subjects, parents to their children, and husbands to their wives were highly respected. Everyone enjoyed the most peaceful relationships.<br><br>
Our customs and habits were so perfect that in our country, in our ancestors’ tombs, and in our homes, all things were in a proper state.<br><br>
But from the moment they arrived with their ill luck,<br><br>
Happiness and peace seem to have departed from everywhere.<br><br>
Our heart cannot restrain its sadness when we look at the incense burner and the bowl of water: offerings on the altar.<br><br>
A foot of our land and a shoot of our vegetables remind us of the humiliation our country endures.<br><br>
Righteous conduct turns into a misdeed in their eyes.<br><br>
Honest people become the basest culprits in their hands.<br><br>
They execute our brave and loyal defenders while they feed and cherish gangs of scoundrels and hooligans.<br><br>
Alas!<br><br>
The double-barreled rifle is a heartless rifle.<br><br>
Now we clearly see that the tricolor flag is a devious flag.<br><br>
Where can you not see that<br><br>
They excavate our tombs, destroy our shrines and pagodas – what they do is all against human nature.<br><br>
Where can you not hear that<br><br>
They burn our houses, rape our women - what they do is all athwart the right way.<br><br>
Heaven will not leave our people enchained very long.<br><br>
Heaven will not allow them the free enjoyment of their lives.<br><br>
From antiquity to the present day, who could lay claim to the strength of Heaven.<br><br>
At the end, everything shall encounter its master.<br><br>
You, officials of the country,<br><br>
Do not let your resistance to the enemy be blunted by the peaceful stand of the court.<br><br>
Do not take the lead from the three subjected provinces and leave hatred unavenged.<br><br>
Where are those moments<br><br>
When you sharpened your scimitar, when you lifted your wooden rifle, descending on the streets in great glee as if you would beat up or hack at all men.<br><br>
Now,<br><br>
Your hands have touched silver taels, your mouth has counted notes of a hundred, and you can no longer hold high your head anywhere. You kneel down and bow low before the enemy.<br><br>
With what face may you go to them to receive your diplomas?<br><br>
With what face may you go to them with your offer of surrender?<br><br>
You swore to give all your efforts to fight the French.<br><br>
And now, because you like riches too much, you turn to serve the enemy.<br><br>
In doing that, you contribute to the division of the South from the North.<br><br>
Do you thus have the heart to dye half the silk thread blue and the other half gold?<br><br>
You, inhabitants of villages,<br><br>
you owe a heavy debt of gratitude to your land and to your rivers,<br><br>
You should at each moment bear in mind your duties as subjects of your ruler,<br><br>
You should help each other to maintain the flame of resistance, waiting for better circumstances.<br><br>
Do not heed their perfidious appeals to surrender.<br><br>
On hearing of the loss of our garrison in Go cong, do not change your mind so as to massacre each other.<br><br>
Because the population of Ben nghe was evacuated, do not let yourself be tempted to offer submission to the barbarians.<br><br>
Alas!<br><br>
Such a hostility, such a hatred, such an enmity; our heart will not be quieted before we are avenged.<br><br>
So many years of labor, of energy, of suffering – shall we now abandon all?<br><br>
Rather, we should go to the far ends of jungles or to the high peaks of mountains in search of heroes.<br><br>
Rather, we should go to the shores of the sea in search of talented men.<br><br>
Do not envy the scholars who now become provincial or district magistrates [in the French administration]. They are decay, garbage, filth, swine.<br><br>
Do not imitate some who hire themselves out to the enemy. They are idiots, fools, lackeys, scoundrels.<br><br>
At the beginning, you followed the way of righteousness. From beginning to end you ought to behave according to the moral obligations which bind you to your king.<br><br>
Life has fame, death too has fame. Act in such a way that your life and your death will be a fragrant ointment to your families and to your country.<br><br>

I<br><br>
TON THO TUONG <br><br>
Three provinces of our territory are left. <br><br>
To be at such an extremity is undoubtedly the result of the will of Heaven and Earth.<br><br>
Swiftly, telegraphic cables were installed, straight.<br><br>
Like black clouds, the smoke of battleships rose to the sky.<br><br>
Wavering in their actions, they are furthermore slow in devising plans; I truly have much pity for them.<br><br>
As for me, I too am apprehensive of future days.<br><br>
It is indeed not easy to play with the mouth of the tiger or the jaws of the dragon.<br><br>
I therefore advise these children not to act recklessly. <br><br>
PHAN VAN TRI <br><br>
The outcome of the struggle between here and there is not yet definitive.<br><br>
If we have been reduced to extremities, it has been quite beyond our will.<br><br>
We cannot allow our determination to falter because of the many fires in Ben nghe. At Con rong, no one was impressed by the ash that blew in the sky.<br><br>
There will be a time when the dogs we now raise will kill the rabbits, There will be days when the nets we now string will trap the deer.<br><br>
Do not rely on the tiger’s smell to terrify the monkey.<br><br>
My heart is of iron, it shall never waver. <br><br>
II<br><br>
TON THO TUONG <br><br>
In acting recklessly, one gathers naught but a bad reputation.<br><br>
No one asks me to mind what are not my matters, <br><br>
Yet, my heart aches when I see a careless child play near a deep well.<br><br>
The way is long, and the day already declines. Age will not wait. <br><br>
My robe is now on my shoulders, and you shall see my artisan’s ability; <br><br>
With towers and horses, I will change the trend of this chess game. <br><br>
Who can be sure where fortune and misfortune lie? <br><br>
My ears are deaf to words issuing from snakes’ mouths and moths’ tongues.<br><br>
PHAN VAN TRI <br><br>
Your iron heart has strayed, and your reputation is already tarnished.<br><br>
Why do you not examine your own situation and why do you excel in uttering nonsense? <br><br>
A man of intelligence is deeply concerned lest his fame be not great.<br><br>
An idiot forever fears that age will not wait.<br><br>
Uncertain as a chess game though the struggle is, <br><br>
Your artisan’s hands have already printed a plan for a peaceful settlement.<br><br>
As long as the family’s hatred is unavenged and the country’s debt unhonored, How can one veil one’s face and deaden one’s ears? <br><br>
III<br><br>
TON THO TUONG <br><br>
I had to veil my face and shut my ears in the midst of this turmoil.<br><br>
For when I consider the situation of the country, I am all the more keenly ashamed of my own affairs.<br><br>
Of the traditional righteous way there remains only a pile of dying embers.<br><br>
Our familial nobility is encased in dust and relegated to obscurity.<br><br>
As a bell of hundred pounds is suspended from a slender thread,<br><br>
The five moral obligations weigh on my shoulders.<br><br>
Buffalo, horse, or whatever they call me, I accept all these names.<br><br>
My life itself does not concern me, should I care for my reputation?<br><br>
PHAN VAN TRI <br><br>
How do ears remain insensitive in this turmoil? <br><br>
Rebuking others, you neglect to blame yourself.<br><br>
And then, you dare speak pompously of the righteous way, <br><br>
In your situation, how can you presume to evoke your familial nobility? <br><br>
In a deep gully, a small bark is a miscalculation.<br><br>
You are foolhardy to suspend a heavy bell from a slender thread.<br><br>
As long as life lasts, reputation must be considered, <br><br>
I advise you then to have regard for your life and your reputation. <br><br>
IV<br><br>
TON THO TUONG <br><br>
How can I consider my reputation when all is wrecked? <br><br>
I am all the more grieved when I chance to think of the immensity of the sea and the height of the sky, <br><br>
Or course it is arrogant to go into the mountain after the tiger. <br><br>
But is it ambition to dive into the river for fish? <br><br>
People stare open-eyed at me, showing their white pupils. <br><br>
Others suffer in their heart for the loyalty lost. <br><br>
As for me, I pity this brood of tender chickens that has lots its mother. <br><br>
I am doing my best to help them, and far be from me the desire to praise myself.<br><br>
PHAN VAN TRI <br><br>
What a fool you are, who do not consider your life or your reputation. <br><br>
The candle has burnt to ashes, and my tears are still not dry. <br><br>
You have ruined completely the nobility of your family; <br><br>
And the fame which has accrued from so many generations, you have torn to pieces. <br><br>
You act like a merchant who chances upon a pearl, <br><br>
Your hurry resembles that of a pauper who is in view of gold. <br><br>
It is because I pity persons who belong to the same cultural background that I recall these matters for you. <br><br>
It is certainly not my intention to speak highly of myself.<br><br>
V<br><br>
TON THO TUONG <br><br>
You speak highly of your physical strength and you are over-confident in your intellectual abilities. <br><br>
And yet you belong to the category of those who sell shadows and move their lips. <br><br>
The dragonfly is not aware of the power of the spider’s web until it is caught in it. <br><br>
The wind which carries the tiger’s odor sufficiently terrifies the fox. <br><br>
If you are so thoughtful, why do you wait there calmly for the rice bowl to be brought to your mouth? <br><br>
Too slow in devising plans for action, you do not know that the water will soon reach your waist, <br><br>
The situation remains too complex for one to point out who is right and who is wrong. <br><br>
Therefore kindly restrain your dance of triumph.<br><br>
VI<br><br>
PHAN VAN TRI <br><br>
It is indeed the mark of an intelligent person to speak highly of what he does rightly. <br><br>
How can the perfidious belong to the same category as the just? <br><br>
The swan, though she is wounded, does not fear the sparrow, <br><br>
And the tiger, once cornered, is overcome by the fox. <br><br>
Men like Nhan are not terrified by the blade placed against their tongues. <br><br>
Men like Khuat are not perturbed when the water reaches their waist. <br><br>
I shall begin to move when the opportunity comes. <br><br>
If we are to realize the great project, we ought not hurry.<br><br> 

<center><b>Phan Thanh Gian’s letter to the Emperor Tu Duc (8 July 1867)</b></center><br><br>
“I, Phan Thanh Gian, make this presentation, expressing frankly, head down, my humble feelings, and soliciting, head up, your clairvoyant examination. In the period of difficulties and misfortunes we are going through now, rebellion arises around the capital; the pernicious influence spreads to our borders. The territorial question is rapidly moving towards a situation in which it is impossible to stop. By duty, I must die. I dare not live thoughtlessly, leaving a legacy of shame to my Sovereign and to my Father. Fortunately, I have confidence in my Emperor, who has a wide knowledge of antiquity and the present and that has deeply studied the causes of peace and disorder . . . By respectfully observing the warnings of Heaven and having mercy on the man’s misery. . . , by changing the strings, by shifting out of the rut, it will still be possible for You to act according to your strengths and resources. At the very end, with a tight throat, I do not know what to say, but, wiping my tears and raising you to my loving looks, I can only wish fervently (the realization of this wish). With respect, I am making this presentation, Tu Duc, 20th year, the sixth moon, the seventh day, Phan Thanh Gian.”<br><br> 

<center><b>Phan Thanh Gian (1796-1867), “Letter on His Surrender” (1867)</b></center><br><br>
Officials and People, <br><br>
It is written that he who lives according to Heaven’s will is in the right way; he who departs from Heaven’s will is wrong. To act according to Heaven’s will is to act according to one’s reason. Man is an intelligent animal created by Heaven. Each animal lives according to its proper nature, like water which seeks its own level or fire which spreads in dry places . . . Man to whom Heaven has given reason should endeavor to live according to that reason. <br><br>
The Empire of our King is ancient. Our gratitude towards our kings is total and real, we cannot forget them. For several years now, the French have come, with their formidable war matériel, to implant trouble among us. We are weak compared to them; our officers and soldiers have been defeated by them. Each battle merely added to our misery . . . The French have huge battleships, full of soldiers and armed with powerful cannons. Nobody can resist them. They go where they choose; the strongest fortifications collapse under their attack. <br><br>
I raised my spirit to Heaven and made myself attentive to the voice of Reason. And I said to myself: It would be as senseless for you to assail your enemy as for the fawn to attack the tiger. You would only draw suffering upon the people whom Heaven has entrusted to your care. I, therefore, wrote to all the civilian and military officials [under my jurisdiction] to lay down their arms and to surrender their fortresses without giving battle. <br><br>
But, if I have followed Heaven’s will in averting calamities from the people’s heads, I am a traitor to my King in surrendering without resistance the provinces that belong to him. <br><br>
I deserve death. <br><br>
You, officials and people, you may continue to live under the command of the French - who are ruthless only in battle - but their flag should not fly over a fortress where Phan Thanh Gian still lives.<br><br>
<br><br>

<center><b>The Agony of Phan Thanh Gian, Commander Ansart to the head of General Staff Reboul, Vinhlong (August 4, 1867)</b></center><br><br>
“My dear Captain, We have arrived at the fatal outcome of the drama of the poisoning of Phan Thanh Gian. He died last night and his body was transported this morning outside of the citadel. The interment will take place in Kebon (home village of Phan Thanh Gian) in a few days. It is not without a strong sense of sorrow that we saw this remarkable old man perish and I’m sure this feeling will be shared by all who knew him. He completed his suicide with a stunning resolution of firmness. Having already prepared his body with the ravages of diet of 15 days of poison, he coolly made all the arrangements, bought his coffin, mourning clothes for his family and servants, paid for the funeral ceremonies to the smallest detail, and gave his children wise and worthy advice. He urged them to stay with the French, but not to accept any job from them. They had to stay well behaved, peaceful people, honestly rallied to France, without participating in matters of policy, except for advising peace and work everywhere. As for his grand-child, for whom the same reasons abstention could not exist, he recommended they be raised with care by the French, and he showed me, a few days before the performance of his fatal resolution, his desire to leave me a few thousand francs to meet the costs of their education in Saigon. I did not understand then the meaning of his words, which would not have escaped Father Marc, if he had been present, and everyone is convinced that, Father Marc and I, we could have had enough influence over him to prevent him from carrying out his suicide. But fate stepped in; I did not understand his words, which came to me through the channel of an interpreter. When Father Marc came, Phan Thanh Gian made no further allusion to his desperate purpose. On August 1, in the morning he regularized some documents relating to the Christian community. “Hurry,” he said. At eleven o’clock, he took the poison in front of his children and his entourage. When we came to embrace him, Father Marc and me, the agony began. The surgeon, Monsieur Coniat struggled against the poison with intelligence and dedication, who left us until last night a glimmer of hope, but was powerless to save the old man saturated with opium and already defeated by starvation and sorrow ... “August 5, 1867 ...”Father Marc is convinced, based on previous conversations, that this good old man was a Christian when he had been stripped of politics and pressure from other mandarins. They have really pushed him to despair. This is so true that, as long as the mandarins have been in Vinhlong, he stubbornly refused any sort of remedy and that it was only by a kind of violence and enjoying one of his many blackouts, we could make him swallow a counter-poison. But, once we had made him understand that the mandarins were gone, there was no longer anybody but him with us, he agreed to everything. Too late, alas! And what shows how his ideas had taken a better course, it’s that he asked Father Mark twice, “Will I make it?”. Unfortunately, you know the outcome ... “<br><br>
