	<h4>I. AN OVERVIEW</h4>
	<br>
	
	
	<p>
	<p>The “first encounter” of the Portuguese with the people of “Asia” was in some ways very different from the European encounter with the peoples of the Americas and with the inhabitants of parts of southwest and southeast Africa. Beyond <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">Sofala</a>, in the area called Asia by the early Portuguese writers, the situation was different. Although those who had traversed the whole distance from the West to China and vice versa were very few in number, many traders – Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Armenians, Jews – had linked India with the Mediterranean for centuries. Vasco da Gama’s Portuguese were certainly not the first Europeans in these regions and European visits to South and Southeast Asia across the Islamic world continued into the fifteenth-century and beyond. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Nicolo di Conti</a>, a Venetian merchant, traveled for twenty-five years in West, South, and Southeast Asia between 1416 and 1441. Venetian envoys like Josafat Barbaro, who returned to Europe in 1478, and Genoese emissaries like Girolama da Santo Stefano, who ventured to Sumatra between 1493 and 1499, certainly added to what learned Europeans knew of the East. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> Indeed, the Portuguese came to the East precisely because they had heard so much about it.
	</p>
	
	<p> As has been pointed out repeatedly by many scholars, the first man that Vasco da Gama sent ashore at Calicut was taken to two North African Muslims who could speak Castilian and Genoese. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> [f.3]
	</p>
	
	<p> On the other hand, the activities of a few European traders and travelers in the Indian Ocean in the fifteenth century cannot really be compared to the impact of the continuous presence of the Portuguese – soldiers, sailors, administrators, and priests – in forts and trading posts all along the Ocean littoral during the period that followed the voyage of Vasco da Gama. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> In the study of this interaction between the Portuguese and the “Other,” it is sometimes necessary, due to the nature of the evidence available, to regard the Portuguese as a single group. Yet they were, in some respects, very diverse.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> A similar transformation occurred within the Portuguese community settling in the East.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> Contemporary Muslim accounts do not give us an inkling of the preconceptions that Islamic peoples of the region had about the Christians of Europe. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> The reaction of the Samudri, the Hindu ruler of Calicut, can be gleaned from Portuguese accounts.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> 
	</p>
	
	<p> The importance of the Indian conception of the state and of the role of the king in assessing the attitude of Indian monarchs toward the newcomers has been highlighted by Michael Pearson. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> Yet the Portuguese did alienate the principal ruler on the Malabar coast. How much of this rift was due to ignorance of local conditions by the Portuguese? <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>
	</p>
	
	<p> It has been suggested by some analysts that some of the initial misunderstandings might have been eased if there had been greater proficiency by at least one of the parties in the language of the other. [f.24] [f.25] [f.26] [f.27] [f.28] [f.29]
	</p>
	
	<p> Yet communities with divergent cultural traditions (for example, Hindus and Muslims,) had lived amicably for centuries in the Malabar coast of India. It is clear that some of these adverse views of each other were a result of a conflict that stemmed from the Portuguese decision to use force to monopolize the import of spices from Asia. [f.30]
	</p>
	
	<p> There are numerous instances of excessive violence by the Portuguese. [f.31] [f.32]
	</p>
	
	<p> On the other hand, there were many Muslims (as well as those of other faiths) who proved willing to assist the Portuguese for their own profit. [f.33] [f.34]
	</p>
	
	<p> One of the factors that overshadowed possibilities of political and economic cooperation was the divergence of the Portuguese attitude toward religion from that of the Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. [f.35] [f.36] [f.37] [f.38] [f.39] [f.40]
	</p>
	
	<p> However, religion was also significant in terms of the differential integration of Asian communities in the European universe. [f.41] [f.42] [f.43] [f.44] [f.45] [f.46] [f.47]
	</p>
	
	<p> Differential integration with indigenous peoples led to changes in Portuguese social stratification within the colonial possessions. [f.48] [f.49] [f.50]
	</p>
	
	<p> Other more widespread instances of the intermingling of artistic traditions can be seen in the use of Asian decorative motifs in Indo-Portuguese furniture and household goods. [f.51] [f.52] [f.53] [f.54] [f.55]
	</p>
	
	<p> Another area that has shed light on the extent of cultural interaction is the study of Portuguese creole languages. [f.56] [f.57]
	</p>
	
	<p> Obviously in the long run the extent of the accommodation varied according to location, class or caste, and religion. [f.58] [f.59]
	</p>
	
	<p> Beyond the pale of Portuguese power the impact of their culture was certainly limited; its greatest impact came through religion. Even those Portuguese who ate rice with the fingers of their right hand were brought up in the belief that those other than Christians were idolaters. A century of Portuguese writing on the wonders and novelties of South Asia include some comments on Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism but indicate no real understanding of any of these religions. Long after political conflicts were resolved, religious prejudice and historical memories on either side kept peoples apart.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>II. A CASE STUDY: SRI LANKA</h4>
	<br>
	
	<p> The interaction between the Portuguese and the people of the Kingdom of Kotte, located on the southwestern plain of the island of Sri Lanka, provides a rare example of a “first encounter” that is described by both indigenous and Portuguese sources. In this case, two accounts – one Portuguese and one indigenous (Sinhalese) – allow us to discover how each side interpreted the incidents of the initial encounter and trace how memories and traditions relating to the “first encounter” were modified by later contacts and experiences. The two documents chosen are very different in nature. The Portuguese description is drawn from the long, rambling, and detailed The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon, written by a Jesuit priest, Fernao de Queyroz. [f.60] Queyroze, born at Canavezes (Portugal) in 1617, entered the Jesuit Order in 1631 and lived in India from 1635 till his death in 1687. He never visited Sri Lanka (Ceylon), but assiduously collected data relating to Portuguese activities in Sri Lanka after his countrymen were expelled from the island by the Dutch. His major motivation in writing this work seems to have been the fact that a fellow Jesuit whom he admired, Pedro de Basto, [f.61] had predicted that some day the Portuguese would regain control of Sri Lanka. Queyroz, in his book, believed that the loss of Sri Lanka was simply God’s punishment of the Portuguese for the inequities of their rule in Sri Lanka. Therefore he had no compunctions about exposing Portuguese misdeeds; indeed, evidence of them was essential to prove his own thesis. On the other hand, as a Portuguese and a missionary, Queyroz could not but regard the conquest of Sri Lanka as a laudable and glorious achievement, both for the King and for the Faith.
	</p>
	
	<p> In this respect, Queyroz is squarely in the tradition of the Portuguese historians such as Joao de Barros, Diogo do Couto, Fernao Lopez de Castanheda, Gaspar Correa, Joao dos Santos, Francisco de Souza, and Paulo de Trinidade, who recorded the deeds of their compatriots in Asia in great detail. [f.62] [f.63]
	</p>
	
	<p> The Sinhalese account is much harder to define. [f.64] [f.65]
	</p>
	
	<p> The main events of this first encounter in Sri Lanka have been carefully examined by many generations of historians. [f.67] [f.68]
	</p>
	<p> This description, while revealing few specific details of the first impressions that the Portuguese themselves had of the people of Sri Lanka, provides many clues relating to the preconceptions that they held. [f.69] [f.70] [f.71]
	</p>
	<p> The interpretation of Sinhalese attitudes toward the Portuguese as portrayed in this quotation from the Rajavaliya depends partly on the author or source of information for this section of the chronicle and the possible transformation the text might have undergone during transmission. [f.72] [f.73] [f.74] [f.75]
	</p>
	<p> The description of the first meeting has elements of drama and the story, in time, entered the folk memory of the Sinhalese. [f.76] [f.77]
	</p>
	<p> What the recent reexamination of the text has done is to open up the possibility that the text might have been reinterpreted (and even subtly altered in the process of copying) in later times. [f.78]
	</p>
	<p> A further analysis of the Rajavaliya account of events that followed shows a distinct difference in perception between its author and the Portuguese chroniclers. [f.79] [f.80]
	</p>
	<p> Here is a story of Sinhalese cunning thwarted by Portuguese foresight. [f.81] [f.82]
	</p>
	<p> This was woven into the picture of cowardly and deceitful Asians. [f.83]
	</p>
	<p> The Portuguese view of the Sinhalese as cunning and deceitful was reinforced in time by the numerous wars and uprisings against Portuguese dominance. [f.84] [f.85] [f.86]
	</p>
	<p> Then again, the Portuguese did begin in time to make distinctions between various indigenous peoples. [f.87] [f.88]
	</p>
	<p> The Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, or at least one version of it, seems to be reflected by the section of the Rajavaliya/Alakeshvara Yuddhaya dealing with the events from about 1550 to 1581. [f.89] f.90] [f.91] [f.92] [f.93] [f.94] [f.95] [f.96]
	</p>
	<p> The Mandarampurapuwatha, a local history of a small portion of the central highlands of Sri Lanka that never came under Portuguese rule, offers a much more critical view of the Portuguese. [f.94] [f.95] [f.96]
	</p>
	<p> The argument that the attitude of the Sinhalese Buddhist toward the Portuguese grew increasingly bitter with the continued oppression and warfare in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries is borne out by other Sinhalese documents such as the Parangi Hatana, or Rajasiha Hatana. [f.97] [f.98] [f.99]
	</p>
	<p> The Sinhalese war poem composed in the late seventeenth century, the Maha Hatana, relates how the Portuguese arrived from Goa with presents for the king of Kotte, and at his feet asked for permission to lay as much merchandise as could fit on a cowhide to show their goods. [f.100] [f.101]
	</p>
	<p> What seems to emerge from this examination of the first encounter is that while images of the “Other” at the time of contact could well be multiple in time, each community created a composite image of the Other by concentrating on what seemed to be new and different among the strangers. As a rule, the image seemed to be a negative one, especially in times of misunderstanding or conflict; but in any case, the image of the Other is often influenced by self-perception. To the Portuguese who saw themselves as conquerors, the Sinhalese were timid and unwarlike. To the Sinhalese Buddhists to whom self control and contentment were noble ideals, the Portuguese were simply rapacious. On the other hand, even in literate societies where some accounts of the first contact were recorded within one or two generations, the traditions came to be embroidered or altered in subtle ways to explain current realities. The emergence of new social divisions, such as the growth of a Christian community in Sri Lanka, resulted in efforts to modify the image of the newcomer. As Greg Dening reminds us: “. . . The Past and the Other are two of humanity’s main preoccupations. Rendering significant what has happened is a daily, seasonal, celebratory, generational activity, done in private and in public, personally and institutionally . . .” [f.102]
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>III. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</h4>
	<br>
	<p> In the closing years of the fifteenth century and in the early years of the sixteenth, the explorations of the Europeans brought them into contact with diverse groups of peoples. It is not necessary to belabor the point that in all these interactions, the two sides in each encounter saw each other through a cultural filter and that in each case the reactions to first contact also depended on historical memories of earlier contacts with other “Others” modified by ongoing experiences.
	</p>
	<p> By the time the Portuguese reached Asia they had already met many different groups in Africa.
	</p>
	<p> The destruction of the court archives of all of the coastal states of South Asia and the disappearance of many local traditions have made it difficult for us to make detailed evaluations of the Asian reactions. [f.103]
	</p>
	<p> Interaction between two different groups also involves the interaction of individuals. The perception of the Other by an individual could depend on the position in society, the degree of acculturation, the personality, and the personal experiences of that individual. Obviously, the greater the degree of division within a community and the more diverse the interests of the individuals within it, the more likely it will be that there will be differential reactions to the newcomers. Of the many different interpretations of the first encounter, we can hope to have a glimpse of just a few. [f. 104]
