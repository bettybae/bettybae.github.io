Appleby, L. Hunt and M. Jacob, <i>Telling the Truth about History</i> (New York, 1994), 272.] Such comments seem to me to reflect a very American perspective and to underline the fact that, for the USA, the “long” Second World War did not constitute the visceral crisis which it did for other combatants.

Nations Examine Their Past: A Comparative Analysis of the Historiography of the “Long” Second World War</p>
<p>R.J.B. Bosworth
University of Western Australia
</p>
<p>IN RECENT YEARS we have lived through a slew of commemorations of the end of the Second World War. 
As early as April, 1994, an editorial writer on 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100"><i>The Economist</i></a> wondered about the meaning of this 
commemorating.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> The anniversaries of the end of the 
Second World War, the author of the editorial 
suggested, signaled the chance to review what had been said, and, thus, what had been left unsaid 
about that conflict in its widest ethical definition, and, thus, about what I have called, in my 
own recent book, the “long” Second World War. What I implied in my usage of that term was that the
 military events of the war, with their own inextricable civilian connections, were also welded to
 their immediate pasts. Thus, Italy’s “long” Second World War began with the Fascist accession to 
 power in 1922, Germany’s in 1933, Japan’s in 1931, the USSR’s in 1929, or perhaps in 1917, 
 <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Britain’s</a> and 
 <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">France's</a> in the Depression or in the commencement 
 of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">Appeasement</a> policies.
 <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> 
 Seeming to understand this concept of a war larger than the events from 1939 to 1945, <i>The 
 Economist</i>’s journalist argued: “For nations as for people, denial of the past can be 
 corrupting... ‘Never again’ and ‘know thyself remain handy maxims for just about every 
 country under the sun.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> In this regard, 
 the article concluded, Germany had become probably 
 the most “honest” society in its “collective self-analysis.” Other ex-combatant states— the 
 journalist mentioned Russia, France, Italy and Japan, but, strangely, not Great Britain
 <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a>—had 
 not yet done as well in grappling with this aspect of their past.</p>
<p>
As I scanned the editorial (and wondered self-indulgently whether someone had read my book),
it seemed to me that the journalist, in writing an assessment of the present 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>
of the Second World War, nonetheless had not yet fully reckoned with the history of this
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>. In the paper which follows 
I shall endeavor to overcome that absence by
briefly examining the turning-points in post-1945 explanations of the “long” Second World
War. For, I shall argue, the historicization process has been underpinned by its own
structures. Individual historians, the historiographies of particular nations, naturally
have nourished their own idiosyncrasies. Every person or unit possesses some free will.
And yet the history of fifty years of history writing, of historical “representation” and
“explanation” about so terrible, so wrenching, so “ultimate” an event as the war, does
reveal many commonalities, and shows, predictably, that, as 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">E.H. Carr</a> remarked after his
own, highly equivocal, experience of the “long” Second World War, "the fact is that all
human actions are both free and determined, according to the point of view from which one
considers them.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>
</p>
<p>After 1945, cities and lives were reconstructed out of the devastation of bombing,
after the passage of armies and after having endured the horror of German occupation.
As Bruno Bettelheim and many others<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> 
would remark, so, too, were ideas to be re-made
after the war and with the holocaust and “Auschwitz” at least partially in mind. The
war’s assault had injured time itself—not for nothing would people believe that the
worst abyss of the Second World War should be dated at Anno Zero, Year Nought, a moment
in which national continuities, and therefore “history,” had been shattered as surely
as had the buildings of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Warsaw</a> and 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-112">Hamburg</a> and Leningrad and Tokyo and 
the rest. All survivors of the conflict were to some extent left with the task of either 
abandoning their history or re-working it.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> 
All had to re-establish a national calendar and
re-locate a usable past. All had to find a strategy to repair the trauma of war, to
permit time to flow again and thus to resume the more ordinary chronology of national
history.
</p>
<p>The historical reconstruction which occurred under the brightest glare of attention
was that of “Germany,” or, rather, of West Germany, since the DDR (the German
Democratic Republic), at least by the 1980s, was following a historiographical track
bearing some similarity to that taken by the Soviet bloc which shall be reviewed
below.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Frank Fiiredi, in his 
self-consciously radical analysis of the place of history
in our society, has concluded that, “after the end of the Second World War, it was not
possible to think of a return to a normal past.” He has spoken of an “intellectual
crisis of the Western world,” a crisis which would survive until the 1960s: “If there
is a single experience which dealt a severe blow to nationalist history, belief in
absolute values and identification with society, it is the Second World War.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> But in
so arguing, Fiiredi underestimates the shamelessness and durability of conservative
versions of history. At least in so far as West Germany is concerned, what is striking
about the 1950s is precisely the German history profession’s initial ability to write
off the whole Nazi experience and to re-compose a familiar nationalist account of the
past. This comfortable re-working was accomplished by the simple expedient of blaming
Nazism either on Hitler—the Wicked Great Man whom a malevolent Destiny could have
wished on any society, the “accident in the works”—or on the general corruption and
sinfulness of the “West” since the French Revolution, a milieu in which the feeble
Weimar Republic had been only one bit-player among many. Sociologically speaking,
the German historical profession had emerged relatively unscathed from the highly
uneven “Nazi Revolution.” For historians like Hans Rothfels or Gerhard Ritter, “Business
as Usual” was the first slogan for the post-Auschwitz world.
</p>
<p>This slogan would be amended (in some part) only in the 1960s. The symbol of change,
and the object of major controversy over his two great books—Griff <i>nach der Weltmacht</i>
(1961) and <i>Krieg der Illusionen</i> (1969)— which conveniently marked out the beginning
and end of the decade, was Fritz Fischer. Bolstered by some new-generation historians,
who would assemble in the so-called Bielefeld school, and by the work of the liberal
sociologist, Ralf Dahrendorf, Fischer gave intellectual legitimacy to the idea of the
“negative <i>Sonderweg” </i>  (negative separate path). According to this interpretation, Hitler
and his regime were not mere aberrations. Rather a continuity ran through German history
from the flawed unification of 1870 to 1914 to 1933 to 1945 and, perhaps, beyond. In
that “German era,” the German nation bore the greatest responsibility for two world wars
in all their horror, and did so not just because of geo-politics and strategic machination,
but also because of the German elites’ refusal seriously to countenance democracy.
German decision-making, certainly in the Imperial era and perhaps in the Nazi one,
reflected the “primacy of internal politics.”
</p>
<p>Moreover, the Fischerites alleged, for the sins of this <i>Sonderweg</i>, historians themselves
must take some blame. Secure in the prestige of being the children of Leopold von Ranke
and confident that their understanding of his “scientific” historicism meant that they
wrote the truth, the German professors had traditionally served their nation to the cost
of humankind. But these same professors, as they gravely occupied their much-reverenced
and well-rewarded chairs, now, it seemed, needed to engage in some self-criticism.
There were plenty of messages, too, for West German politics at large. To make sure the
“negative special path” had been abandoned, West Germans must accept that the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) should at last be legitimized, as it had so signally failed to
be before 1914 or during Weimar. Willy Brandt’ s <i>Ostpolitik</i> was plainly the proper line
for West German diplomacy; only an <i>Ostpolitik</i> could officially end the Second World War
and repudiate the traditions of the <i>Drang nach Osten</i>. No wonder controversy raged around
Fischer’ s books. As Dahrendorf would explain: “Its bitterness and intensity are
understandable only if we remember that Fischer has pulled the center piece out of
the whole, useful conception of history the profession has built up”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> and, he might
have added, out of the basic conservative comprehension of the German past, present
and future.
</p>
<p>From the fire of these controversies came spiritual and practical growth. When, in
the 1970s, the Social Democratic Party entrenched itself in government and the Bielefeld
school seemed to gain hegemony in the writing of contemporary history, West Germany
appeared to have learned the “lessons” of the Second World War and, indeed, to be
democratizing its politics and society even as it democratized its history. Nor,
despite some very public alarms, has the situation been drastically reversed since
then. In time, the Bielefeld concentration on high politics, or at least on the
relationship between politics and society, the school’s still largely Rankean
methodology and its cautious preference for the social models of Max Weber rather
than those of Karl Marx, brought criticism from the Left. In the Anglo-Saxon world,
Geoff Eley wrote of his determination “to help establish the legitimacy of Marxist
analysis in the plural discourse of German historians,”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> and urged that the sin of
Imperial Germany lay not so much in the persistence of its ancien regime as in its
modernity. The German <i>Sonderweg</i>, in his eyes, was not so “peculiar” after all. In
his fertile writings Eley thus in a sense spoke for those inside and outside Germany
who believed that the Social Democratic Party had paid for its political legitimation
by surrendering its radical soul and who asserted that new times demanded a new
critique.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> Nor were Marxists and 
Marxisants the only doubters. By the end of the 1980s
Martin Broszat, in preaching the cause of <i>Alltagsgeschichte</i> and of what some have
called the “barefoot historians” of everyday life, warned that “the Nazi era has lost
much of its singularity in light of new catastrophes and atrocities, and we are left
with a set of convictions, as safe as they are vague, that no longer carry any moral
force.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> From the perspective of 
every day, perhaps, the “long” Second World War was
no longer the only or the chief ethical touchstone for the politics of the 1990s.
</p>
<p>While the Left sought out new issues, on the Right there was plenty of evidence that
minds had not been radically purged by the “contestations” of the 1960s. The theory of
totalitarianism remained the dominant paradigm in West German school history and
communism remained a literally unspeakable ideology. Nor had other conservative ideas
been abandoned. In the <i>Historikerstreit</i> of the mid-1980s, figures such as Ernst Nolte,
Michael Stiirmer and Andreas Hillgruber enunciated anew beliefs for which Fischer and
his followers had criticized the Imperial or interwar intelligentsia. They argued that
the Bolsheviks had a primacy in evil which the Nazis only imitated, that Germany’s
geo-political position, “living in the center of Europe,”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> carried certain inevitable
strategic demands and requirements, and that the nation deserved to be proud of its
history and its happy future was inseparable from a happily understood past.
</p>
<p>The nationalists may not have won so sweeping a victory in the <i>Historikerstreit</i> as
the conservative leader Helmuth Kohl, with the help of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP),
was winning in German politics, but the dispute would indicate that their views did
have some echo in more moderate circles. In a much praised speech in 1985, liberal
resident Richard von Weizsacker, although he re-affirmed that the genocide of the Jews
constituted an event “unparalleled in history” and accepted a liability for the Holocaust
on the part of all Germans, nevertheless stayed more equivocal about some other aspects
of the Nazi story. For him the Nazi regime still marked “an aberration in German history”;
its only proper dating ran from 1933 to 1945 and, then, “at the root of the tyranny was
Hitler’s immeasurable hatred against our Jewish compatriots.” Though Weizsacker acknowledged
the suffering of “twenty million” Soviet and other Eastern European dead and, indeed,
of German communists, he did not give great emphasis to the Nazis’ anti-Marxism. Instead,
he argued that the fall of the Nazis represented the conclusion of a [West] “European
civil war”; the meeting of the Soviet and American armies on the Elbe was, he said, “a
symbol of the temporary end of a [West] European era.” And, of course, he repudiated
the most obvious, short-term, result of the Second World War—the disunification of Germany.
“We Germans are one people and one nation,” he reiterated, “We are confident that the 8th
of May [1945] is not the last date in the common history of all Germans.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a>
</p>
<p>A decade later, a reasonable historiographical peace seems to reign in reunited Germany.
Some re-writing of history has been occurring since 1990 but, perhaps, not in too exceptional
a manner, even if there are signs that “reunited” history will once more be defined, not
merely by politicians but also by some members of the profession, as a nation-building
device.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> The new Germany doubtless has a number of cultural blind spots, especially about
the histories of societies to its East and, most notably, about the no longer existing DDR
(German Democratic Republic of East Germany). Here lie some evident perils. Nonetheless, it
is important not to over-state any reviving German problem. Germany’s present 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>
is as open to free debate and, indeed, to free international debate, as is any in the world.
It is hard not to agree with that journalist of <i>The Economist</i> in observing that the Germans,
at least when compared to other ex-combatant societies, have undertaken a very considerable
“collective self-analysis” of the “long” Second World War . In 1996, it seems reasonable to
assert that now there is no peculiarity of German 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> and no longer a special
German way of comprehending the past. Indeed, the history of contemporary 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> in
Germany seems to provide a yardstick against which other historiographies might be measured.
Have they, too, moved from a denial to a first controversial understanding to a more serene
acceptance that a democratic debate about the meaning of the Second World War will and should
continue?
</p>
<p>The country the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> of 
which displays the most immediate parallels with that
of Germany is Great Britain. Keith Robbins<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> 
and others have commented on this matter in detail.
Three or four distinct stages can be detected in Britain’s historicization of the Second
World War. In the 1950s the lessons seemed clear. Once the moral weakness and “Ethelred the
Unready-style” back-sliding of appeasement had been overcome, Britain, especially as embodied
in the heroic and charismatic figure of Winston Churchill, had claimed the best moral part
in the war. However, as Robbins has noted, this sense of a special history exemplified in
the stubborn fight and the ultimate victory, ironically, gave Britain a damagingly positive
<i>Sonderweg</i> to cleave to, a too “evident” and, in fact, a misleading continuity, one with the
rapid effect of increasing British isolation and blinding Britain’s leaders and Britain’s
people to post-war developments on the continent such as the Common Market, the European
Community, and the European Union.
</p>
<p>Such clarity and simplicity were, however, from time to time attacked. The most bitter
public controversy broke out in 1961, the same year that saw the publication of <i>Griff nach
der Weltmacht</i>, and it centered on A.J.P. Taylor’s <i>The origins of the Second World War</i>.
Taylor’s messages have remained disputed. Twenty-five years after its original publication,
<i>The origins</i> remained a teasing enough book to produce learned disagreement from such experts
in their fields as Paul Kennedy, Akira Iriye and Sally Marks.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> Nor has Taylor’s death 
stilled the debate over his role as a historian.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> 
Many, in 1961 and later, read the book as an extreme example both of empiricism and of relativism. 
In its conception of high politics, everything, it seemed, happened by accident. 
As Taylor would typically remark: “I am sometimes tempted to think that... [historians] talk so much 
about...profound forces in order to avoid doing the detailed work. I prefer detail to generalizations; a 
grave fault no doubt, but at least it helps to redress the balance.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> And yet Taylor, too, had his 
continuity theses— about Germany in the “German century,” about the connection between the Second 
World War and the First, about the reasonableness of reason, and about history as debate.
</p>
<p>Though there might seem to be drastic differences between Fischer’s and Taylor’s books—
the first archival, learned, sober, accurate, the second based on published sources, brilliant,
erratic, and “inaccurate”— they did carry messages that had some comparability. Each attacked
his society’s first understanding of the Second World War. Each wrote, or was read, with an
eye on the present, in which the chance for human agency, for “free will,” for the possibility
that men and women could to a degree make their own history, needed to be re-asserted against
those who had established a single meaning for the past and, therefore, by implication, for
the present and for the future. Each may have written as a methodological traditionalist but
each undermined Rankean-style historicism. Though Taylor would review E.H. Carr’s <i>What is
History? </i>, which also first appeared in 1961, critically, and single out for attack Carr’s
idea that historians always to some extent reflect their age (“study the historian before
you study the facts”),<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> the Taylor and 
Fischer controversies did indicate that a democratic
world was, or should be, a place of historical relativism, in which, as Taylor on a number
of occasions noted, using the phrase coined by Dutch liberal historian, Pieter Geyl, the
discipline of history was accepted as “an argument without end.”
</p>
<p>The artfulness of Taylor’s style, his cleverness, his fondness for aphorism and his
anxiety to show the way to many, sometimes contradictory, answers meant that his fame did
not always guarantee understanding. The more obvious historiographical legacy of the
People’s War” was taken up instead by the “new social historians,” particularly those
in debt to E.P. Thompson, another individual very much “made” in (a certain version of)
the Second World War. Taylor himself retreated from being a European to being a British
historian and, by the time he reached a somewhat prickly old age, his heirs, at least in
stylistic brio and the ability to reach popular audiences, were such historians of the
Thatcherite Right as Norman Stone.
</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s, Britain, too, experienced its quieter version of a
<i>Historikerstreit</i>. Corral Barnett<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> 
was only one who argued that, for Britain, entry
into the Second World War was a mistake, while John Charmley has re-stated the case of
those appeasers who thought the Soviet Union (or the United States?)
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> was the real
enemy. As Charmley put it somewhat archly: “To go on a crusade against evil was one
thing; to do so with evil at your side was another.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>
</p>
<p>The hard men, however, have never swept to power in the British 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> of the
Second World War. Rather, consensus, in and out of academe, probably still lies with an
interpretation which it is tempting to call Majorite, i.e conservative but residually
“wet,” little Englander and not very interested in the theories or practices of foreign
historiographies, full of a nostalgia for the perceived patriotism and decency allegedly
possessed by the British people in wartime but also oppressed by a certain resigned
pessimism,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> and ready to wind down 
but not quite cast aside the Welfare State, that fundamental payment to the British people 
for the people’s side of the war. Britain,
in 1996, is a place for which the history of the Second World War matters both too
little and too much. Britain’s collective self-analysis of that history is still
riven by many gaps.
</p>
<p>What then of Italy, another country in whose 
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> battles have raged over
the meaning of the nation’s “long” Second World War. Listen for a moment to the words 
of Silvio Berlusconi, businessperson, media magnate, football club owner, inventor, for
a brief moment, of the newest of new politics, and fleeting Prime Minister, on 25 April
1994. He was speaking in the immediate aftermath of an apparent electoral victory which
had brought his <i>Forza Italia</i> party into power along with Gianfranco Fini’ s <i>Alleanza
Nazionale</i>, the allegedly “post-Fascist” successor to the neo-Fascist MSI (Italian
Social Movement). The 49th anniversary of the end of Italy’s Second World War was,
Berlusconi urged, the moment to make peace between Fascists and Anti-Fascists; their
past conflicts must now be viewed as only “a piece of history.” From here on, 25 April
should be celebrated by all as “the beginning of a new era.”
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Italians should look to
the future and forget the divisions of the past.
</p>
<p>How, then, did Italy reach this particular “end of history” or, rather, “end of
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>,” the moment at 
which the “myth of the Resistance” to Fascism had its
official obsequies pronounced. The story is by no means unfamiliar. If ever a country
arrived at <i>Anno Zero</i> it was Italy on 8 September 1943. After a war effort which was
feebler, more disorganized, more “corrupt” and, after the loss of its initial impetus,
more lacking in popular support than that managed even by the Liberal regime in the
First World War, the rulers of Italy, and especially King Victor Emmanuel III and
Marshal Pietro Badoglio, nakedly displayed their incompetence, self-interest and
cowardice by then abandoning their capital and their people to the Nazis in the interest
only of saving their lives. Their flight ensured that, in the months that followed, a
new or old Italy had to be forged from the competing forces of the clients of Anglo-American
liberal capitalism in the South, of Fascist “true believers” in the Sala Republic in the
North, of the diverse groups which constituted the “Resistance,” and of those aiming to
stay out of the clutches of all armed forces. As the war front raked the Italian peninsula,
Italians themselves engaged in multiple hot or cold “civil wars” with the aim of
re-connecting past and future.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of these events it is not at all surprising to fmd that the initial
Italian interpretation of the “long” Second World War preferred forgetting to analysis.
Benedetto Croce only put it more starkly than the rest when he urged that the whole
Fascist period be treated as a “parenthesis” in what he deemed the otherwise positive
history of an Italy of liberty and civilization. Even the Italian Communist Party (PCI)
opted for so-called “national populism” and, particularly through the marketing of
Antonio Gramsci as a sort of lay St. Francis, portrayed their own history as incarnating
the natural good of the Italian people. This good, they claimed, had only been prevented
from full development by misguided and self-interested minorities in the <i>rivoluzione
mancata</i> of the Risorgimento or in the tyranny of Fascism, a tyranny which possessed no
“genuine popular base.” But the most typical Italian historian of the 1950s, and the
one most acclaimed abroad, was Federico Chabod, an anti-Marxist liberal, who clearly
separated the Italian people from any responsibility for the more drastic aspects of
Fascism. “By 1939,” Chabod would argue in his lectures on contemporary history, “Fascism
no longer had the country behind it: the prestige of the leader and regime alike had
crumbled. It was ready to fall to pieces, like a machine whose spring had been broken.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>
</p>
<p>Unlike West Germany and Great Britain, Italy in the 1960s did not produce a major
historiographical controversy to reverse these rather comfortable conclusions about
the recent past. Nevertheless, “the myth of the Resistance” did strengthen in that
decade and was particularly invoked in the 1970s, that time of the Red Brigades, of
the “historic compromise,” and of the “crisis of the Italian crisis” between the
rejection of the anti-divorce referendum in 1974 and the murder of Christian Democrat
leader Aldo Moro in 1978. Perhaps the most vivid parading of a Marxistoid understanding
of Italy’s Fascist experience was provided in Bernardo Bertolucci’s film <i>1900</i>, whose
release in the summer of 1976 coincided with national elections in which the Italian
Communist Party (PCI) won more than a third of the votes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> In its aftermath, Michael
Ledeen, a young American historian whose politics were drifting ever more to the right,
diagnosed a “Nero complex” in the mind of the Italian Republic. This complex, at least
in Ledeen’ s eyes, explained events like the Moro kidnapping and murder in March-May
1978. Italy’s complaint sprang from a misreading of history. Such sad events as Moro’s
killing were, Ledeen wrote, the “logical outcome of a 30 year process that has destroyed
the cultural humus in which democracy can survive.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a>
</p>
<p>In reality there are major reasons to doubt that “the Left” had seized control of
Italian culture, and, if it had, an observer must conclude, in despite of Antonio Gramsci
(and of the constant reiteration of this claim by the contemporary Right), that cultural
hegemony by no means always equates with political and economic power. Certainly in
the history trade during the 1970’s, conservative and liberal professors predominated
in most Italian universities. But Ledeen’s words did foreshadow that a conservative
counter-attack on the “myth of the Resistance,” and thus an Italian version of the
<i>Historikerstreit</i>, would not be long in coming. Here the key figure was Renzo De Felice,
the laborious and pertinacious<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> biographer 
of Mussolini.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> The travail of the Italian
Republic had coincided with the publication in 1974 of the third volume of De Felice’s
study, which covered the years from 1929 to 1936 and which had put forward the
debatable and contested theses that the Ethiopian war was “Mussolini’s masterpiece,”
that, after a decade in power, the Fascist regime could boast of having won the “consensus”
of the overwhelming majority of Italians, and that it was, indeed, succeeding in its
“totalitarian” ambition to forge new men and new women.
</p>
<p>In 1978 it was still unclear who had won this debate, but in the next decade and a
half it became apparent that De Felice indeed was the victor. His successive volumes,
with their massive “factual” base, continued to appear and De Felice became accepted,
certainly outside Italy<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> and to an increasing extent within it, as the master historian
of the Fascist period. He himself went on claiming a simple dedication to objectivity
and the truth revealed in documents. As he had advised modestly in 1975, “before we can
define Fascism we must first write its history.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> Unlike Ledeen,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> he avoided overt
political commitment. But, during the Christmas-New Year period of 1987-88, originally
prompted by a public controversy that followed an official meeting between the then
seemingly triumphant Prime Minister, the anti-communist Socialist Bettino Craxi, and
the young leader of the neo-Fascist “Italian Social movement” (MSI), Gianfranco Fini,
De Felice did clarify the relevance of his work and thus underlined what his representation
of the past meant for the Italian present.
</p>
<p>In a series of interviews De Felice pronounced the death of AntiFascism as an ideology
and as a guide to contemporary life. Mussolini’s regime was not responsible for genocide,
he declared, and the communists had no particular claim to have saved Italy from Fascism.
The Fascist bureaucracy had had its faults but he could not see that it was any worse
than that of the Italian Republic in which he said the only two serious political forces
for the future were Craxi and some Christian Democratic youth movements (and thus demonstrated,
yet again, what inadequate prophets historians usually are). All in all, De Felice told
a journalist from <i>Corriere della Sera</i>: “Anti-Fascism understood as an ideology of state
is not, in a historical or a political or a civil sense, a proper discriminator which can
establish democratic authenticity.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> No wonder Gianfranco Fini, who was still securing
his place as leader of the heirs of Fascism, declared gratefully that De Felice’s wisdom
had ensured that “the <i>dopoguerra</i> is over and done with” and that “after De Felice, no one
can think of Fascism as a hell fallen on Italy.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a>
</p>
<p>It is true, of course, that, for all Berlusconi’ s occupation of the media and for
all his expectation of “hegemony,” Italy remains a place of many voices, a functioning
cultural democracy. However, it is also true that De Felice’s alleged “objectifying” of
Fascism has very much fostered the decline of the Italian Left to its current parlous
condition. Without the ethical impulse of the “myth” of the Resistance to Fascism and
the ideas of social justice it proclaimed, the Left has lost a past and not yet discovered
a future. Although its record doubtless always contained some equivocations, the most
evident victim of these processes has been the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Today it’
is known instead as the Partito Democratico di Sinistra (Democratic Party of the Left,
PDS), even if, as a sort of furtive attempt to retain product-recognition, for a time
it let its old name peep out on its new standard, where the hammer and sickle of yesteryear
(even if patriotically backed by the green, white and red of the national flag) were
almost obliterated by an oak tree. This tree is a choice of symbol of extraordinary irony,
presumably appealing vaguely to environmentalists, but mainly trying to proclaim that
the PDS, stalwart as an oak, is a bearer of longevity, national longevity, and of history,
a “genuine,” “popular,” national, history. Its Anti-Fascist history no longer relevant
and all but excised from some scholarly books and public discourse, the PCUPDS is left
to rely on an advertising message, an <i>etichetta</i>. But, in advertising, how could such an
enfeebled and confused construction of the past compete with the images crafted either by
a real master of virtual reality, and of all that is newer than new, like Berlusconi  or,
indeed,  with  so apparently  straight-forward, commonsensical and patriotic a marketer
of politics as Gianfranco Fini?
</p>
<p>We turn now the vast Union of Socialist Soviet Republics where the fate of Communists
of Italy is writ large. The decline and fall of the Soviet Union is a tale of a society
losing its past just before it became completely plain that it had no future. Those bits
of the past to which, for example, Gorbachev clung, as his “revolution” swept him along,
were in the final analysis two in number—the Revolution of 1917 and the Second World War,
the “Great Patriotic War.” A.J.P. Taylor once sagely warned that “there was no such thing
as the Second World War in the abstract. There was a war in relation to each country and
each of these wars was different.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> His comment usefully bolsters the thesis, already
advanced in this paper, that cultural and political life 1945-1990 was scoured by a contest
for the historical ownership of the Second World War (both “long” and short). Certainly
that Soviet regime, in which a type of Stalinism would stubbornly survive the death of the
dictator and in which the Brezhnevs and Chernenkos seem literally to embody the familiar
refrain that “old [Stalinist] soldiers never die, they only fade away,” was inseparable
from its version of the war.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>
</p>
<p>Of course the Soviet Union had many reasons to claim the war as its own. Though its
leadership for a number of years tried to conceal the extent of its casualties, speaking
of seven million dead when the real figure was twenty, or, maybe, twenty-seven, twenty-nine,
or even more, million, recent historians have recalled that, in 1944 after the Western
allies landed in Normandy on D-Day, for example, the Soviets were killing more than 200,000
Germans a month on the Eastern front at a time when Nazi casualties in the West totaled
some 8000 a month.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> Even if American “Lend Lease” provided some twenty percent of the
Soviet economy in 1943-44,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> the Herculean war effort required to expel the Nazi invaders
was very much that of the Soviet regime and/or of the Soviet people. As Stalin would
put it in February 1946—in words which pre-figured the concept later advanced by British
historian, Arthur Marwick, that war is the ultimate “test” of a modern state and society—
the defeat of the Nazis was “a great school of testing and verification of all the people’s
forces...an examination for our Soviet system, our state, our government, our Communist
party.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> It was a war effort which, still in 1996, has not been well explained, given the
many obvious brutalities and incompetencies of the Stalinist system, and given the way
the invaders seem at first to have been accepted as liberators by considerable sections
of the Soviet populace.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a>
</p>
<p>One notable obstacle to the communist regime’s ambition to monopolize the history of
the war, and to assert the primacy of Russia’s Great Patriotic sacrifices, was the Jews,
those who lived in the Soviet Union, those who, after 1945, survived in the Soviet satellites,
and those who had found refuge in Israel, in the United States and in other parts of the
West. Soviet <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> downplayed Jewish suffering—it was not until 1960 that Anne
Frank’s diary was made available to Soviet readers,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a> while the Auschwitz site in Poland
notoriously memorialized all the victims of fascism rather than singling out the million
or more Jews who had died there.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> The official Soviet line continued to contest the views
of Zionist historians like Lucy Dawidowicz that the Second World War, and, in fact, the
whole Nazi regime, began and ended as a “war against the Jews.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> Indeed, a theme of the
Cold War, a theme which was, if anything, still increasing in importance in the 1980s,
was precisely this radical and often macabre disagreement over who had suffered the worst,
over who had the history of the Second World War on its side and, thus, over who had
most earned the war’s blessing.</p>
<p>
The great symbol of the Soviet regime’s determination to learn only one lesson in the
history of the war was its official textbook, the <i>History of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union/Bolsheviks/ Short Course</i>. At Stalin’s death, there had been 301
editions of this work and 42,816,000 copies had been printed in a total of 67 languages.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a>
Although criticized in 1956 and, from time to time, revised, and despite the fact
that the Soviet historical profession could engage in its own lively debates on
some issues, this manual, with its single and unimpeachable history, was still casting
a long shadow when Gorbachev took over.
</p>
<p>Gorbachev’s economic and then political reforms were soon accompanied by cultural
change. First in literature, theater, and film, and only later in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>—
presumably because history was such a visceral discipline for the Soviet state—new
voices were heard and old ideas were challenged and then, reluctantly, abandoned.
There was an almost bathetic slide into exonerating first this and then that victim
of Stalinism. By January 1988, Gorbachev himself was declaring that it was “impossible
to agree with those who propose to forget history or to utilize only a certain part
of it,” and one of his supporters mused shortly thereafter: “Learning the truth about
history is difficult work, it stings many people to the quick.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> The sting was
bringing not just difficulty but death for texts and for a whole regime. In April 1988,
Yuri Afanas’ev, a radical who had gained recognition as a historian of the <i>Annales</i>,
stated roundly: “there is not and has never been in the world a people and a country
with such a falsified history as ours.”49 Action followed words. In May 1988,
secondary school history exams in the Soviet Empire were canceled on the grounds that
the textbook was out of date. <i>Izvestia</i> explained: “Even the best and more inquisitive
teachers... [had] presented the history of our homeland in a monstrously distorted
and unrecognizable form.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> Leningrad, City of the Revolution, of the 1941-43 siege
and of Shostakovitch’ s 7th Symphony, reverted to the St Petersburg it had been before
1914. History in the Soviet Union was over (and the promised new standard textbook
would never appear).
</p>
<p>In his contemporary account of these events, R.W. Davies concluded that the
experience of the Soviet Union in casting out its history was unique: “nothing
like this has ever happened in the history of the world.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> From a comparative
perspective it is easy to see that Davies was exaggerating. What the Soviet Union
was going through historiographically did bear some similarity with the experience
of the other ex-combatant states of the Second World War. The sense of dislocation
and of a story being “untrue” was the greater in the Soviet Union because the
revisionism had taken so much longer to arrive there. It was the greater, too,
because the Soviet elite, frozen in its own experience of the “long” Second World
War, had each year allowed the gap to grow more yawning between the hope maintained
in the regime’s “history” and the decline evident in its “reality.” Stalin once
remarked contemptuously: “Who, save hopeless bureaucrats, can rely on written
documents alone? Who, besides archive rats, does not understand that a party and
its leaders must be tested primarily by their deeds and not by their declarations.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a>
Ironically, by 1989-90, Gorbachev was left only with the words of a history which
did not make sense; as a party historian then mused with splendid naiveté, “at the
moment we still do not have the answer.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> Nor, since 1990, has the magic recipe
been found. Rather, all the Russias remain places where memory, both of communism
and of non-communism, may well be “dangerous”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> and where, as one historian has
wryly put it, “the past cannot be predicted.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>
</p>
<p>No doubt the USSR was particularly stubborn in its refusal to engage in a “collective
self-analysis” of its history. Its representations of the past were particularly
crude and inadequate. But the Soviet Union was by no means the only society which
preferred to keep its myths of the Second World War simple rather than subjecting
them to too much debate. To conclude this brief over-view paper let me turn to the
examples of France and Japan.
</p>
<p>Of all post-Second World War histories, France’s is in many ways the most remarkable.
Germany, Japan and even Italy may have transmuted the dross of defeat into the gold
of economic advance but France experienced a different but still more dramatic
transmutation. From the nation which, so utterly and so humiliatingly, given its
“history,” collapsed in 1940 and which did not much recover in 1940-44 (nor, arguably,
in 194446), from the nation which seemed to have given definition to “Year Nought,”
France has become the great cultural victor since 1945. De Beauvoir, Sartre, Levi-Strauss,
Barthes, Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Iragary, Kristeva, the names run on and
on and compose an intellectual (and, indeed, imperial) galaxy of a brightness unequaled
by any other national intelligentsia. Similarly Paris has been the home of what is
widely accepted as the “greatest history journal in the world,” the <i>Annales ESC</i>. Fernand
Braudel, the author who would cheerfully accept the responsibility of a “weighing up of
the world,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a> and who preached the need to write <i>“histoire totale,” </i> was, before his
death in 1985, acknowledged in many places as the world’s best historian.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> Repaired by
the balm of these cultural achievements, the “Fall of France” has been obliterated in
the world’s memory and replaced by the manifest <i>gloire</i> of a cultural imperium on which
the sun never sets. What is to be made of this disjunction? How did France restabilize
itself historiographically after the apparently terrible disruption of defeat,
collaboration and <i>la guerre franco-francaise? </i>
</p>
<p>Marc Ferro, a third generation editor of the <i>Annales</i>, and unusual in that journal for
his interest in contemporary history, has observed that “to control the past is to master
the present, to legitimize dominion and to justify legal claims.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a> But when an
investigator asks how France has controlled the history of its “long”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> Second World
War, there is a paradoxical answer. The most authoritative attempt to trace the
lineaments of this paradox is Henry Rousso’s <i>Le syndrome de Vichy</i> (1987). Rousso has
provided a graph of the neurosis he has detected in France’s reviewing of its past.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a>
It displays something which by now ought not to be unfamiliar to a reader of this paper.
After an initial obsession with the events of the war and its aftermath, for almost a
generation, from the mid1950s to 	1971, France largely forgot about its recent past.
Here, as elsewhere, the history of the war was swiftly made as comfortable and morally
straightforward as possible. For the majority, contemporary history meant the Gaullist
legend of a good French people resisting, to a man and a woman, from beginning to end,
and of a people absolutely uncontaminated by the Holocaust, except for those few villains
who rightly paid a price in the post-war purges. As Stanley Hoffmann has explained, De
Gaulle “was a firm believer in pedagogical sublimation: the French had to be turned
forward, to effort and greatness, not backward to a morose and divisive analysis of
their failings or crimes.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> De Gaulle himself, and, eventually, the political order
of the Fifth Republic, would embody a France which, except in simple and controlled
patriotic celebrations, excised “Year Nought” out of its public memory, just as surely
as it had overcome the old divisions between those for and those against the French
Revolution, divisions which had so marked French history since 1789, and which had,
indeed, helped to explain the nation’s psychological “fall” in 1940.
</p>
<p>In so doing the Gaullists were assisted by the <i>Annales</i>, or at least by those
historians who accepted the leadership of Braudel. Braudel and his theoretics made
the time of 1940-44 a little thing, a trifling “event” before the greater power of
the structure and the <i>longue duree</i>. Braudel, along with his “scientific” history,
preached a patriotism, an “eternal” France<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> and an acceptance of very strict
limits to human free will in pursuit of change. Braudel, as a sort of intellectual
testimony, stated, in contradiction to the Marx of <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire</i>: “men
do not make history, rather it is history above all that makes men and thereby absolves
them from blame.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a>
</p>
<p>Such a learned, if self-interested, basis for forgetting may have served for
a while. Rousso’s graph, however, moves upwards again after 1968, that is, while
the Fifth Republic was endeavoring to work out whether its institutions could
survive the end of De Gaulle’s own political career (and when Braudel, “boss” of
the second generation of the <i>Annales</i>, handed over the editorship of his journal
to the “third”). The immediate trigger for renewed debate about France’s “long”
Second World War was not a history book but a film, Marcel Ophuls’ <i>Le Chagrin et
la Pitie.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a></i> When a critical history book bearing some resemblance to <i>Griff nach
der Weltmacht</i> or <i>The origins of the Second World War</i> did appear, it would be written
by Robert Paxton, an American.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> The works by Ophuls and Paxton did mark a certain
turning-point with parallels to what had happened in Germany and Britain a decade
earlier. And, in the subsequent twenty years, a debate has continued about the meaning
of the war-time French regime in Vichy, though I would doubt Rousso’s reading of
its intensity. Rather, a comparative analysis indicates that the French history
profession’s contribution to our understanding of the general crisis of the “long”
Second World War is decidedly minor and thus, in this special field, inferior to
the overall cultural success of the French intelligentsia and, more specifically, of
the <i>Annales</i>.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the successes which should be most remarked. It would be churlish
to doubt the contribution of the <i>Annales</i> in so many historical fields, or to deny
its “span” of interests and method. Post-communist Europe today is particularly
attracted by the <i>Annales</i>, at least partially because of its assertion that politics
is, as Ferro put it, often “a kind of shadow-play .”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> The Braudellian concept of
the structural majesty of the <i>longue duree</i>, before which the events of one or two
generations are of evanescent significance, also has an obvious appeal for those
anxious to cancel Marxism-Leninism from their history. And yet, for all its triumphant
export industry in these and other ideas, there is also something rather troubling
about France’s continuing reticence about some aspects of its “long” Second World
War. Such trouble was incarnated by Francois Mitterrand, that <i>socialiste sans
doctrine</i>, with his own doubtful past and ambiguous present.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> Despite the hopes of
some of his supporters, whatever it was that Mitterrand brought to power 1981-95,
it was not a clearsighted reading of French history. Nor have Mitterrand’ s defeat
and death clarified matters. Rather, present French politics are dominated by Jacques
Chirac, a Gaullist determined to forget nothing and remember nothing (though perhaps
per force vulnerable to the appeal of “free market” economics), and by Jean-Marie
Le Pen, the man of the Right who has long written off the gas chambers as a “minor
point in the history of World War II.” Generally, then, French politics in the 1990s
remain unmoored to any credible, or at least any appealing, pasts, and France,
relying more on the nostalgia of memory<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> than the criticism of history, confronts
a political future of an uncertainty comparable to Italy’s.
</p>
<p>Another polity in a state of high ambiguity is Japan, that economic wonder of
the modern world, or at least of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Japan, of course,
experienced very much its own version of a “long” Second World War, even if it was
one which culminated in the bombs which fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and which,
therefore, simultaneously carries a universal significance. Part of the story of
this Japanese war is the conflict after Pearl Harbor with the United States, a
conflict which recent <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>, not altogether convincingly, has been seeking
to define as a struggle between “enemies of a kind.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> Perhaps the more troubling
area of Japan’s history is domestic, and covers the imposition of those policies
which have been felicitously described as “cool fascism.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> Internationally, the
greater issue is not so much Japan’s wartime policy towards the United States
(or Australia) but rather the imperial regime’s campaigns against its Asian
neighbors, disfigured, as they were, by a brutality which ranged from a medieval
style sacking of cities to germ warfare to the gross exploitation of “comfort
women.”
</p>
<p>An extended review of Japanese <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> on these issues is not possible
here. But the Japanese representation of this difficult past carries two or three
major themes. The first is the superficial virtue, or utility, of forgetting.
Silence about the “long” Second World War has hidden the fact that, for all its
“Americanization,” “democratic” Japan was a place of many continuities, best
symbolized by the survival of wartime Emperor Hirohito himself. Moreover, the
bureaucrats of “democratic” Japan remained almost completely unreconstructed
figures and those in charge of education have never accepted that textbooks should
suggest any criticism of national policies, or that history, if it is to have
any humanist purpose in a modern society, must foster debate and accept and endorse
a certain social “disunity.” With the collapse of the Soviet Union and its myths
of the Great Patriotic War, Japan is now the society which remains most impervious
to historiographical change, the country in which the initial interpretation of
the catastrophes of 1941-45 is still the authoritative one.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a>
</p>
<p>Critics of this bureaucratized and homogenized history there have always been,
notably from within Japanese universities’ history departments, and, more erratically,
from within Japan’s socialist party. Since the death of Hirohito, such voices
have been heard more regularly, or with less overt condemnation, than in the past.
Emperor Akihito himself has, on a number of occasions, expressed his sorrow over
Japan’s brutal treatment of its neighbors, even though Japanese textbooks have
certainly not abandoned their conservatism and patriotism. To a distant observer
present-day Japanese <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a> thus seems to exhibit a new uncertainty which
parallels the apparent confusion of contemporary Japanese politics. Japan’s postwar
era may well be over, but just what will replace it politically and economically,
and what it will rely on culturally and historiographically, are not yet clear.
Japan’s past and future are as clouded as is its present.</p>
<p>
I began this paper by seeking to study the ways in which historians have sought to
represent and explain the “long” Second World War, now that we have passed the
fiftieth anniversaries of its end. Though there were many diverse second World
wars, each conflict, and the knowledge that each was part of a whole, had a searing
impact on those who came after; each ex-combatant society had its “syndrome,”
induced by the recollection of war and “resistance,” of tyranny and a mass and
civilian killing unknown in previous times. Each society lived self-consciously after
Auschwitz and Hiroshima, incapable altogether of forgetting its history and, in
that sense, dependent on historians to find a way to “explain” this past.
</p>
<p>Historians by no means were always free agents, however. Their histories were as
“written” by their societies, and by those societies’ pasts, presents and futures,
as by the individuals concerned. In most instances there was soon a numbness about
the appalling past, and this numbness could easily be adapted by conservatives
(including Stalinist conservatives) to their own political ends which usually
entailed obscuring the part they had played in engendering the catastrophe. But,
because of the Resistance and because the Second World Wars were in part “people’s
wars,” and wars which had been won for and by the people, new interpretations of
this past soon appeared, often with initial controversy, but often also with the
effect of further assisting democratic reforms and of facilitating the construction
and expansion of the Welfare State.
</p>
<p>In their turn, these critical accounts fell under attack, as the Right regained
its confidence and resumed its “natural” political authority. Conservatives became
newly aggressive in deploring the wickedness and irresponsibility of the Left. By
the mid to late 1980s, Lucy Dawidowicz, battling to keep “pure” her Second World War
as a conflict wholly defined by being “against the Jews 1933-1945,” averred “today
the worldwide anti-Semitism of the Left has become if anything more open and
unmistakable.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> Alan Bloom complained more simply that students were nefariously
being indoctrinated with the view that men and women in the past were always wrong.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a>
Gertrude Himmelfarb thought that “new historians,” among whom, remarkably, she
numbered Braudel, were fragmenting the present even as they fragmented the past:<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a>
</p>
<p>In the main, however, this refreshed Right, sometimes with the playful and
unreliable backing of radical post-modernists, was not especially preoccupied with
history. As far as its devotees were concerned, economics offered the most reliable
way to predict and thus comprehend the future.” As Henry Rousso commented: “now that
history no longer has the purpose of forging a national identity, it has no
therapeutic value, and, in the short term, at least, it often has the effect of
perpetuating old divisions.” But, he added: “World War II...gave birth to the world
as we know it today. The birth occurred not only in pain but in alienation and
division.” It would be my contention that, as much of the history of the Second World
War slips into the theme park or into oblivion, historians will do something to put
off the horror of an “end of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">historiography</a>” while they go on exploring the meaning
of these terrible events and while, in free and fragile debate, they keep arguing about
those divisions, that alienation and that pain.

Appendix
</p>
<p>Not a Foreign Country
<i>Nations Need to Know Themselves and Confront Their Pasts</i>
</p>
<p>For nations as for people, denial of the past can be corrupting. The more unpleasant
the face in the mirror, the more vital it is to look at it. “Never again” and “know
thyself” remain handy maxims for just about every country under the sun. None is without
skeletons. But how to overcome a natural reluctance to take them out of the cupboard?
</p>
<p>The Germans have achieved a remarkable feat of collective self-analysis and contrition.
That painful process—still going on, with the viewing in Germany of the film “Schindler’ s
List”—has helped to create an exemplary democracy and a nation generally sensitive to the
fears of foreigners.
</p>
<p>The Russians have done less well. True, during the Gorbachev era, the belated
exposure of crimes committed in the name of a totalitarian regime played a valuable
part in bringing the collapse of communism. True, Russian historians can now dig in
the archives and reveal the horrors that were kept out of the national consciousness,
and therefore its conscience. But there is still no public self-examination, in the
German manner, of the extent to which millions of Russians were complicit in Stalin’s
crimes.
</p>
<p>Other countries have found it no easier to master the art of <i>mea culpa</i>. Japan’s
just ex-prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, courageously admitted a wider measure of
collective guilt for Japanese war crimes, but the Japanese have yet to look that
history straight in the eye. Italy’s crimes during the fascist era were less horrific
in scale, but as a nation Italy has avoided the kind of collective self-analysis
engaged in by the Germans.
</p>
<p>The task of self-examination is even harder in countries, such as France, where
the post-1945 issue is not so much the initiation of crimes as collaboration in the
crimes of others. The wounds caused by brother betraying brother often go deeper
than those inflicted by an external foe. So it is understandable that politicians,
from de Gaulle to Mitterrand, should wish to draw a veil over the squalor and dwell
instead upon <i>la gloire</i>. Yet when the victors look back this summer to celebrate
their D-day landings 50 years ago, their view of the past will surely be more honest
than it would have been had not Paul Touvier, a Frenchman, just been convicted of
wartime crimes against humanity. Whatever the shortcomings of a trial so long after
the event, the introspection it has inspired should help to stifle the crowing.</p>
<p>
Raking over the past is never pleasant, but to forget the lessons of history is worse.
Nationalism, racism, and hostility to immigrants have risen in much of Europe.
Mussolini’s heirs are coming back to government in Italy. Vladimir Zhirinovsky has
done alarmingly well in Russia. This is a time to remember the evils of rampant
nationalism, not to forget them.
</p>
<p>
<i>The road to understanding</i>
</p>
<p>National pride is not ignoble. But the line between pride in valor and gloating
triumphalism should be clear. Old soldiers who actually fought on the beaches know
where to draw it; their fond memories are invariably tempered by solemnity and
sadness, if only for fallen friends. Next year, when the peace of 1945 is marked,
the emphasis will rightly shift to reconciliation.
</p>
<p>Pride, in any event, should be matched with sober self-knowledge. The place to
start is in rigorously frank textbooks at school. Lest they be smug, Briton should tell their children candidly about the ill-treatment of Irish and colonial peoples, just as Americans should pull no punches about Indians and slavery. The next place for conscience-pricking is in an inquisitive press. Best of all are leaders, like President von Weizsacker of Germany, who foster national honesty about historical guilt. If the past is indeed to be a place where they do things differently, it must be recognized that it is not a foreign country.

<p>Notes
</p>
<p>1. 	The editorial writer remembered the title of David Lowenthal’s, <i>The Past Is a Foreign Country</i> (Cambridge, 1985), though he or she was modernistically anxious to detect “the lessons of history” from it and other sources.
2. 	Naturally, I develop this argument more fully in R.J.B. Bosworth, <i>Explaining Auschwitz and Hiroshima: History Writing and the Second World War 1945-1990</i>, London, 1993.
3.	See appendix.
4.	Actually, the journalist did think the British and the Americans had things to
worry about in their pasts (imperialism, slavery etc.). They just were not matters directly relating to the “long” Second World War.
5.	E.H. Carr, <i>What is History? </i> (Harmondsworth, 1964), 95.
6.	Most recently by J. Winter, <i>Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: the Great War
in European Cultural History</i> (Cambridge, 1995). Winter’s account of commemorating and mourning the First war is based on a sense of the impossibility of doing this for the Second.
7. 	In so arguing I am disagreeing with those commentators who aver that the authority of the Second World War was rapidly ousted by that of the Cold War. Joyce Appleby and her colleagues have urged that a “new Republic of learning’ is possible since the end of the Cold War. As far as they are concerned this event also entailed the end of the way in which ‘throughout the globe, for forty years, rigid categories of right and left have polarized all thinking about society both between nations and within those societies where free speech was tolerated.” [J. Appleby, L. Hunt and M. Jacob, <i>Telling the Truth about History</i> (New York, 1994), 272.] Such comments seem to me to reflect a very American perspective and to underline the fact that, for the USA, the “long” Second World War did not constitute the visceral crisis which it did for other combatants. The US did not in any sense arrive at Year Nought in 1945 (and, in 1994, a new republic of learning sounded disturbingly like a “new world order” for intellectuals in general and historians in particular).
8. 	But note Georg Iggers’ acute comment on the large and increasing significance of a “correct” reading of history for the East German regime: there, he has noted, “history occupied a very important role second only to <i>Marxism-Leninism in the hierarchy of academic disciplines because of the special function it served in legitimizing their regime.” G.G.

Taylor: the Traitor Within the Gates</i> (London, 1993) which is dull, literal and “scholarly,” and A. Sisman, <i>A.J.P. Taylor: A Biography</i> (London, 1994) which is lively, personal and “journalistic.”

Robertson (ed.), <i>The Origins of the Second World War: Historical Interpretations</i> (London, 1971), 140. Taylor would then also note in modest <i>goak</i>: “I am an old-fashioned, hack historian.” (141).
21. 	Taylor also, characteristically, was troubled by the glibness of Carr’s optimism. For the review, see A.J.P. Taylor, <i>Politicians, Socialism and Historians</i> (London, 1980), 53-55.

23. 	Clive Ponting has recalled that R.A. Butler, that quintessential appeaser, stated in 1939: “In my political life I have always been convinced that we can no more count on America than on Brazil” and, in May 1940, on Churchill’s accession, he complained: “the good clear tradition of English politics...had been sold to the greatest adventurer in modem political history...a half-breed American.” C.

25. 	For a case study in this regard, compare and contrast, A. Calder, <i>The People’s War: Britain 1939-45</i> (London, 1969) and his <i>The Myth of the Blitz</i> (London, 1991).
26. 	I owe this detail to R. Ben-Ghiat, “Fascism, Writing, and Memory: the Realist Aesthetic in Italy, 1930-50”, <i>Journal of Modern History</i>, 67 (1995), 627-665.
27. 	For far and away the best analysis of the ambiguities of this time, see C. Pavone, <i>Una guerra civile: saggio storico sulla morality nella Resistenza</i> (Turin, 1991). The usage of the term “civil war” is not without its dangers, however. They are well exemplified in an interview with De Felice published in 1995 in which the historian seemed almost regretful that Fascist Italy failed to win the Second World War. See R. De Felice, <i>Rosso e nero</i> (Milan, 1995). For Pavone’s own, more sensible thoughts on these matters, cf. <i>Passato e presente della resistenza: cinquantesimo anniversario della Resistenza e della guerra di liberazione</i> (Rome, nd), 111-16.
28.	F. Chabod, <i>A History of Italian Fascism</i> (London, 1963), 84.
29.	For my own reading of this film, see R. Bosworth, “Bemardo Bertolucci, <i>1900</i>
and the Myth of Fascism,” <i>European History Quarterly</i>, 19 (1989), 37-61.
30. 	See, e.g., M. Ledeen, “Aldo Moro’s legacy,” <i>New Republic</i>, 178 (13 May 1978) and cf. his <i>Italy in Crisis</i> (Beverly Hills, 1977). At around the same time, Walter Laqueur, who was assisting Ledeen’s career, argued, with extraordinary exaggeration, that, as a result of the De Felice controversy, “some foreign observers even reached the conclusion that the Gleichschaltung, something akin to self-Finlandisation, had already taken place and that it was a foretaste of how much political and cultural freedom would ultimately survive under a government with communist participation.” W.  Laqueur, “‘Eurocommunism’ and Its Friends,” <i>Commentary</i>, 62 (August 1976), 30.
31. 	The first volume of De Felice’s biography was published in 1965. Thirty years later, after 4 volumes (3 with 2 parts) and more than 5600 pages, the last volume is still awaited. It is typical of De Felice that his “introductory” bibliography on Fascism should list 12,208 items. R. De Felice (ed.), <i>Bibliografia orientativa del fascismo</i> (Rome, 1991).
32. 	In 	1976, Michael Ledeen acted as De Felice’s interviewer in a summary <i>Intervista sul fascismo</i>. For its English-language version, see R. De Felice, <i>Fascism: An Informal Introduction to Its Theory and Practice</i> (New Brunswick, NJ: 1976). Ledeen, it was alleged with considerable ingenuousness or cynicism, acted as interviewer to avoid the “bias” inevitable in an Italian.
33. 	For a recent, and still largely uncritical, example, see B.W. Painter, “Renzo De Felice and the Historiography of Italian Fascism,” <i>American Historical Review</i>, 95 (1990), 391-405, and cf. the portentous, if not necessarily convincing, explication of the
De Felice line in N. Zapponi, “Fascism in Italian Historiography, 	1986-93: A Fading National Identity,’ <i>Journal of Contemporary History</i>, 29 (1994), 547-68.
34. 	R. De Felice, <i>Interpretations of Fascism</i> (Cambridge MA: 1977), 153. He was quoting views expressed by Angelo Tasca in 1938.
35. 	Among other interests, for example in the Middle East, Ledeen became particularly associated with the “new man” of Italian politics of that decade, Bettino Craxi. For his own versions, see, e.g., M. Ledeen, <i>Grave New World</i> (New York, 1985); Perilous statecraft: An Insider’s Account of the Iran-Contra Affair</i> (New York, 1988).

38.	A.J.P. Taylor, <i>Letters to Eva 1969-1983</i> (London, 1991), 87. Taylor regularly
stated the “real” Second World War was that of 1941 	(June and December), not the “little” war of 1939 or 1940.
39. 	For a lively study of the memorialization of the Great Patriotic War, see N. Tumarkin, <i>The Living and the Dead: The Rise and Fall of the Cult of the Second World War in Russia</i> (New York, 1994).

42. 	Cited by M. Harrison, “Stalinist Industrialization and the Test of War,” <i>History Workshop</i>, 29 (1990), 66. Harrison noted as well that Gorbachev in October 1987 used very much the same language: —The aggression imposed upon us was a pitiless examination of the viability of the socialist structure, the fortitude of the multinational Soviet state and the strength of patriotic feeling of Soviet peoples. And we passed this examination by fire and sword, comrades’ (prolonged applause).”
43. 	For a recent example of the avoidance of explanation even by a particularly acute historian, see S. Fitzpatrick, <i>Stalin’s Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village after Collectivization</i> (New York, 1994). This book tells a moving but ultimately bleak tale of the peasants’ hostility to Stalin and all his works, and of the same peasants’ “demoralization.” Its chronology, however, ends before Fitzpatrick is obliged to explain the war effort of that same peasantry. For an earlier paper of hers on this subject, see <i>“War and Society</i> in Soviet Context: Soviet Labor Before, During and after World War II,” <i>International and Working-Class History</i>, 35 (1989), 37-52. She then concluded: “For forty years the Soviet Union has been remembering and memorializing the war as the nation’s [sic] central shared experience, an affirmation of its spiritual strength, common purpose, and claim to the respect and admiration of the world.” (48).
44. 	B. Pinkus, <i>The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority</i> (Cambridge, 1988), 282. Pinkus notes that, to some extent, the regime’s initial reluctance to “give credit” to Jewish suffering may have had a “genuine popular base” in the sense that the leadership feared too much recognition to the Jews might have engendered a traditionally Anti-Semitic response from a populace reluctant to share its war, and its suffering, with anyone.
45. 	For a case study of a Lithuanian moment of forgetfulness in which the local Jews can be said to have died twice, see E.T.
