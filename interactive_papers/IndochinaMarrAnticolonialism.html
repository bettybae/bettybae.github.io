		<p>
	
	The Nguyen rulers and their representatives attempted to meet the barbarian
threat in the only ways they knew&#8212;namely, by exclusion of
Westerners, repression of Catholicism, antiquated military defense from
within citadels and breastworks, and, when all this failed, negotiation
from positions of abysmal weakness, perhaps hoping to stall or perhaps
unconsciously envisioning a simple “shifting of tribute” from Peking to
Paris. In the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1860s and 1870s</a>, however, as the tragedy worked itself out,
a few mandarins began to leave office in disgust, while literati who did not
hold office began to find more and more reason simply to stay in their
home villages and avoid involvement. As in the south, these people remained
loyal to the monarchy as an idealized institution but became increasingly
hostile toward those who were conducting state policy.
</p>

<p>
When events came marching to their doors, however, all were forced
to take stands. They were expected as scholar-gentry to provide guidance
and leadership. Yet, though no figures are available, we can surmise that
a numerical majority chose passive resistance, an angry but nonviolent
withholding of services and support. Traditionally, this was an acceptable
form of scholar-gentry protest to a new dynasty, but it had never achieved
much respectability as a tactic against foreign invaders. We may wonder
whether this time the bulk of the villagers&#8212;the peasantry&#8212;found it to be
an acceptable form of “leadership,” as French patrols began to enter the
very bamboo hedges around the villages and to disrupt their existence
entirely.
</p>

<p>

In the long run, it would be the minority of the elite that would put the
heaviest imprint on modern Vietnamese history, in this case those obdurate,
militant, idealistic scholar-gentry who “knew the proper way of dying”
for a person of their status in society. It is important to understand
what this meant, since the message was lost on most French contemporaries
and even to this day has been misinterpreted by most writers not familiar with 
the ethos of the period. In an objective sense, the violent 
actions of these men forced the French after 1885 to intrude more directly
and comprehensively into the affairs of north and central Vietnam
than was wise in a “protectorate,” exposing the fist of foreign de facto
control down to the district level and thereby undercutting the effectiveness
of court and mandarin collaborators. Even more significant was the
subjective impact. By their armed resistance, seemingly hopeless by any
rational criteria, they sustained an alternative ethic to those being presented
in Hue and Saigon, an ethic deeply rooted in Vietnam’s previous experiences
with foreign intervention. It was this ethic, nurtured on a day-to-
day basis by the slights and savageries of French colonial rule, that was
successfully passed on to subsequent generations, providing what I believe
is one of the real keys to an understanding of anticolonial
movements in Vietnam.

</p>

<p>

I have made passing reference already to the breakdown well before
1882 of official authority in the north. The origins of this lie far back in
the long Trinh/Le domination of the north and in the recurrent popular
risings of the nineteenth century which made that area the most difficult
to control for each Nguyen ruler.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> When 
Garnier stormed <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a> in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1873</a>,
making Hue’s impotence perfectly obvious, he met little or no locally organized
resistance. This was partly because the events happened so fast,
including Garnier’s death and the consequent withdrawal of most French
forces from the scene, but also because people in the north were already
demoralized and directionless, having been subjected to raids and extortion
from every imaginable source.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>

</p>

<p>

With the return of French forces to the Red River delta in 1882 and the
second fall of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a>, northerners were just about through with any hopes
of concrete royal leadership. They organized more and more without
reference to Hue. We know from the backgrounds of some later resistance
leaders that villages already were being organized for self -protection,
were establishing their own ties outside the district, and were obtaining
firearms from China via a wide range of Chinese, Vietnamese, and tribal
intermediaries in the hills. Royal court records of this period were filled
with messages from district mandarins to the effect that the people were
asking to fight, wanting to fight. And Riviere’s messages praised certain
Hue representatives for “helping quiet” the people in and around <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a>
After the August 1883 agreement was signed in Hue, a French diplomat
accompanied a group of mandarins northward to order general observance
of the new, harsh provisions. But they were avoided or refused outright
in many places; some local mandarins turned in their seals of royal
patent and headed out to recruit resistance forces, and a few committed
suicide-several trying to kill a Frenchman personally before killing
themselves.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> Perceptive 
Frenchmen had reason to compare the situation
with the grand fiasco of Napoleon III in Mexico, guerrilla resistance and
all. There was major resistance, but it would come too late, with no
central direction, and&#8212;perhaps most important&#8212;with the depressing
knowledge that Vietnam after 1885 was without allies, since China would
not influence events in anything like the manner of the United States in
Mexico.

</p>

<p>

The poor showing of remaining royal units during the French attack on
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">Son Tay</a> December 14, 1883, put a final cap on northern alienation from
Hue (see Map 2). One leaflet circulated at the time spoke of the royal
officer who opened the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">Son Tay</a> gates to the French as a “God-cursed
traitor who acted like a worm in one’s bones.” “Imperial edicts reach us
in bitterness,” the leaflet grumbled, and court officials are “cowards excessively
anxious to save their lives.” The writer significantly found his
heroic symbols in pre-Nguyen times:

</p>

<blockquote>

We possess our life, but we must know how to give it up.
Shall we remain silent and thereby earn the reputation of cowards?
As long as there exist people on this earth, we shall exist.
As long as there is water, we must bail it out.
We must read the Proclamation on the victory over the Wu.
We shall follow the example of those who exterminated the Mongols.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a>


</blockquote>

<p>
During 1884 there were numerous local attacks on French units, in
direct violation of orders from Hue. Some former mandarins began to
achieve fame as resistance leaders well beyond their home districts, for
example, Nguyen Thien Thuat (Hai-Duong, Quang Yen provinces), Ta
Hien (assisting Ch’ing forces in Bac-Ninh province), Nguyen Quang Bich
(with Liu Yung-fu in Tuyen-Quang province), and Nguyen Cao (BacGiang
province).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> French 
operational timetables for pushing the Chinese
out of Vietnam toward Kwangsi and Yunnan were repeatedly upset by
the necessity of retaining or shifting large numbers of troops in rear areas
as defense against “bandits.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> A striking Ch’ing victory at Lang-Son in
March 1885 raised local Vietnamese hopes. As the Chinese were making
preparations for new attacks against Bac-Ninh and Hung-Hoa, however,
word arrived of a Sino-French armistice, and Vietnamese spirits
plummeted accordingly.

</p>

<p>


With the withdrawal of Ch’ing troops being essentially complete by the
end of May 1885, the French could turn full attention to emasculating
the lingering war party in Hue and to crushing all centers of local resistance.
General Roussel de Courcy, the new French commander-in-chief
and plenipotentiary, was almost a caricature of the arrogant colonialist,
convinced that he could solve all France’s remaining problems in Indochina
by humiliating and destroying the regent Ton That Thuyet and his
slightly more moderate associate, Nguyen Van Tuong. For all that, however,
it may be a measure of Ton’s self-serving character that it took de
Courcy’s personal thrusts, which virtually forced him into a corner, to set
him at last to resolute action-namely, a surprise attack on the French
garrison at Hue and, failing there, the escorting of King Ham Nghi into
the mountains.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>

</p>

<p>


There should be no hesitation in marking July 5, 1885, the date of Ham
Nghi’s flight from the capital, as a turning point in the history of Vietnam’s
response to foreign intervention. First, it brought central Vietnam into the
resistance struggle with a vengeance for the first time, no small factor if
we recall the active historical role of this area in struggles against Mongol,
Ming, and Ch’ing. Particularly by providing leaders, imagery, and psychological
sustenance, the center was destined to be in the forefront of
Vietnamese resistance from 1885 right up to the present.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a>

</p>

<p>

Next, this date marked the termination of all remaining vestiges of
Hue’s sovereignty and the imposition of the final structural elements of
French colonial rule on Vietnam&#8212;without a native monarch to sanction
these acts. This does not mean that the French neglected to place an
alternative to Ham Nghi on the throne in Hue: King Dong Khanh, the
brother of Ham Nghi, went through the necessary rituals in September
1885. Collaborator mandarins could and did argue for his legitimacy.
Indeed, no less a figure than Tu Due’s widow wrote wistfully that under
the protectorate there could again be high mandarins, and they would
“recover and govern as in the past.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a>

</p>

<p>

On strictly legalistic grounds, particularly among those who put survival
of the dynasty ahead of all else, such a position was not illogical.
Nevertheless, the realities of serving a puppet king could hardly have been
lost on these sophisticated students of political power.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Vietnamese mandarins
choosing thenceforth to collaborate with the French had no reasonable
monarchist ideal to defend: they were tools of foreign rulers, and
they knew it. But mandarins choosing to fight&#8212;even those who perceived
the hopelessness of their situation&#8212;retained the monarchist ideal and
something more&#8212;the confidence that they were neither betraying their
forefathers nor leaving a besmirched reputation for their descendants to
live down. In many cases they had to make agonizing Confucian choices
between staying behind to protect family tombs and elderly parents and
sallying forth to defend king and country, a choice that in itself would
advance the development of modem patriotic norms.

</p>

<p>

Finally, and perhaps most important, the significant numbers of scholar-
gentry and peasants who had been pursuing local resistance efforts in
previous years without traditional royal sanction must have been tremendously
relieved and elated to find the king and some of his highest
mandarins moving out among them, depending on them, and calling in the
most emotive terms for a final struggle to throw out the foreign barbarians.
For the young king, the mandarins, and some of their families, such an
existence would be new and physically trying in the extreme&#8212;all the
more reason for followers to empathize and develop an even more venomous
hatred for the French. It has been easy for some observers, particularly
those who cannot sense the Vietnamese people’s agressive pride in
themselves and their history, to dismiss this loyalist movement as simply
the last stand of an outmoded, obscurantist ideal. Yet there is a continuity,
an unbroken thread tying this antiquated resistance to more successful
efforts in the twentieth century.

</p>

<p>

For more than a year before the flight from Hue, Ton That Thuyet had
been storing weapons, rice, gold, and copper cash in several mountain
strongholds, particularly one named Tan-So which was situated above
Cam-Lo in Quang Tri province. By the time the entourage reached this
location, however, a good portion of the royal family had decided to turn
around and take their chances with the French in Hue. That initiative
seems to have come from Tu Due’s old mother, probably encouraged by
Nguyen Van Tuong, who had by then split completely from Ton That
Thuyet. Then, with the hotly pursuing French troops cutting off the road
north and seizing Cam-Loin the valley below, Ton realized that Tan-So
was more of a trap than a stronghold. So he proceeded to escort the king
and his greatly diminished retinue westward in a long, perilous swing up
into north-central Vietnam. Much of the gold and cash was captured by
Hue mandarins who were accompanying the French.

</p>

<p>

The major accomplishment up to that point lay in the promulgation and
distribution to all corners of Vietnam of the Can Vuong (Loyalty to the
King) Edict, which gave the resistance movement its name and which
deserves translation in its entirety here:

<blockquote>
The Emperor proclaims:
From time immemorial there have been only three strategies for
opposing the enemy: attack, defense, negotiation. Opportunities for
attack were lacking. It was difficult to gather required strength for
defense. And in negotiations the enemy demanded everything. In this
situation of infinite trouble we have unwillingly been forced to resort
to expedients. Was this not the example set by King T’ai in leaving
for the mountains of Ch’i and by Hsuan-tsung when fleeing to Shu?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a>
<br><br>
Our country recently has faced many critical events. We<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> came to the
throne very young, but have been greatly concerned with selfstrengthening
[tu-cuong] and sovereign government [tu-tri]. Nevertheless,
with every passing day the Western envoys got more and more
overbearing. Recently they brought in troops and naval reinforcements,
trying to force on Us conditions We could never accept. We received
them with normal ceremony, but they refused to accept a single thing.
People in the capital became very afraid that trouble was approaching.
The high ministers sought ways to retain peace in the country and
protect the court. It was decided, rather than bow heads in obedience,
sitting around and losing chances, better to appreciate what the enemy
was up to and move first. If this did not succeed,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> then we could still
follow the present course to make better plans, acting according to the
situation. Surely all those who share care and worry for events in our
country already understand, having also gnashed their teeth, made their
hair stand on end, swearing to wipe out every last bandit. It there anyone
not moved by such feelings? Are there not plenty of people who will
use lance as pillow,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> thump 
their oars against the side,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> grab the
enemy’s spears,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> or heave around water jugs?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a>
<br><br>
Court figures had best follow the righteous path, seeking to live and die
for righteousness [nghia]. Were not Ku Yuan and Chao Tsui of Chin,

Our virtue being insufficient, amidst these events We did not have the
strength to hold out and allowed the royal capital to fall, forcing the
Empresses to flee for their lives.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> The fault is Ours entirely, a matter
of great shame. But traditional loyalties are strong. Hundreds of mandarins
and commanders of all levels, perhaps not having the heart to
abandon Me, unite as never before, those with intellect helping to plan,
those with strength willing to fight, those with riches contributing for
supplies&#8212;all of one mind and body in seeking a way out of danger, a
solution to all difficulties. With luck, Heaven will also treat man with
kindness, turning chaos into order, danger into peace, and helping
thus to restore our land and our frontiers. Is not this opportunity fortunate
for our country, meaning fortunate for the people, since all who
worry and work together will certainly reach peace and happiness
together?
<br><br>
On the other hand, those who fear death more than they love their
king, who put concerns of household above concerns of country, mandarins
who find excuses to be far away, soldiers who desert, citizens
who do not fulfill public duties eagerly for a righteous cause, officers
who take the easy way and leave brightness for darkness&#8212;all may
continue to live in this world, but they will be like animals disguised in
clothes and hats. Who can accept such behavior? With rewards generous,
punishments will also be severe. The court retains normal usages,
so that repentance should not be postponed. All should follow this Edict

<p>

It should be evident, even in translation, that this was a resistance edict
in the classical tradition, appealing above all to the scholar-gentry, but
not without emotional impact if read or interpreted to the people in general.
We do know that copies reached the major provincial centers of the
north and even penetrated the Mekong delta; and undoubtedly the message
spread by word of mouth to practically every village and hamlet in
Vietnam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> In subsequent 
days more detailed edicts were sent to specific
provinces and commanders, calling either for direct assistance to King
Ham Nghi in central Vietnam or granting belated royal “permission” for
local anticolonial uprisings.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> Royal 
sanction was thus squarely behind
popular resistance&#8212;too late for any temporal success, but still of great
importance in sustaining resistance through its most barren years. With
the flight of the monarch, indignation could no longer turn against him
and therefore focused increasingly on the French.

</p>

<p>

Without the prospect of reinforcements from France in the immediate
future, General de Courcy was disturbed enough by the popular response
to their edict to propose to the Minister of Foreign Affairs a partial or
even general troop withdrawal from the north in order to concentrate on
quieting the center.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> 
As it turned out, this was a pessimistic appraisal.
Enough high-ranking members of the royal family proved willing to collaborate
and enough high mandarins were found to set up a new Secret
Council (Co-mat Vien) to begin to counter the influence of Ham Nghi
and Ton That Thuyet in the provinces. With the enthronement of Dong
Kha’nh as a pliant, unassuming replacement for Ham Nghi, the French at
least could feel a bit more in control, even though Hue meant less each
month as a physical symbol for the Vietnamese at large. Dong Khanh
was the closest the French would come to having an eager collaborator
king (of a total of five until 1945), but his premature death four years
later nullified their ambitious plans for royal tutelage and manipulation.

</p>

<p>

While such activities in Hue were becoming a matter of mere derisive
interest to more and more Vietnamese, there is considerable evidence that
emotional, idealistic monarchism was about to enjoy a last burst of glory
which centered on Ham Nghi until his capture in 1888, and then somehow
continued without a monarch for six or seven years more. After the Can 
Vuong movement had been crushed totally, the activists of the next generation
still felt the need for a royal pretender, until new symbols began to
emerge after 1911.

</p>

<p>

To the degree that the Can Vuong was a disembodied monarchism, it
was not within the mainstream of Vietnamese tradition, which empowered
the physical king with both temporal and spiritual functions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> Nevertheless,
certain ideals would be nurtured by the Can Vuong and passed
on without break to subsequent generations, including a deep sense of
reciprocal leader-follower responsibility, violent resistance in the face of
hopeless odds, ruthless self-denial, and glorification of death in service to
a principle.

</p>

<p>

Lest we ourselves engage in idealization of this traditionalist phenomenon,
it was important to remember that the scholar-gentry of the nineteenth
century were closely rooted to the soil, specifically the soil of their
home villages and districts. Only a scant few were born and raised in the
cities, which is in effect to say Hue or <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a>. Even these cities should in no
way be thought of as approaching in size, grandeur, or functionality such
contemporary East Asian metropolises as Peking, Canton, Kyoto, or Edo.
For example, Hue had a rather modest court, an oversize citadel, and a
satellite town clustered along the river&#8212;all surrounded by an ocean of
ricefields and hamlets. It was a place to which scholar&#8212;gentry at various
times in their lives came and went, but they spent most of their existence
far from court and close to the annual harvest cycle, teaching, writing, or
serving in district and provincial positions. In short, it was the ricefields
that provided them, as well as the peasants, a reason for being and sealed
the contract between man, the soil, and the sky.

</p>

<p>

Thus the scholar-gentry could and did communicate regularly and easily
with the mass of the populace, an advantage that subsequent more urban
elites shared less and less over the decades. However, this also rendered
them highly provincial: in many cases their regional loyalties
paralleled or bisected countrywide loyalties, depending on conditions at
the time. As I have argued, Vietnamese scholar-gentry did share a firm
sense of ethnic identity with the lower classes. The scholar-gentry themselves
were held together by their common educational backgrounds, by
sharing across Vietnam the same elitist values, by the contact maintained
among exam graduates of the same year, and, of course, by traveling much
more than the average person. In the end, however, scholar-gentry leaders
of the resistance after 1885 would find it more difficult each year to maintain
effective liaison with their counterparts in other provinces and regions,
and much more so to develop any overall political or military strategy.
The situation would get much worse before it got better, with no
anticolonial organization until the 1930s even coming close to surmounting
the problem.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>

The only way that the Can Vuong movement can be rendered coherent
in detail is to describe it along essentially regional lines. Almost all the
scholar-gentry leadership had, as we shall see, followings drawn substantially
from their own villages, districts, or provinces. In the short term
this gave backbone to local resistance. In the long term, however, it enabled
French and native colonial units to partition the movement gradually,
crushing one segment at a time. Lack of a central command, lack of
a common strategy, and even the breakdown under stress of elitist bonds
of loyalty proved more important in defeating the Can Vuong warriors
than the more obvious geographical hindrances and technological
deficiencies.

</p>

<p>

The first area worth describing centers on the province of Quang-Binh,
with overlap into Nghe An and Ha Tinh to the north and including the
nearby mountains of Laos (see Map 3). After Ham Nghi’s flight, the
French moved quickly to seize the forts at Dong-Hoi and Vinh, but patrols
found nearby villages practically deserted and rice going unharvested.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Soon 
the heart of resistance became the lateral spur of hills dividing
Quang Binh and Ha Tinh, quite heavily populated in the upper reaches
of the Ngan-Sau and Gianh rivers and connected with provinces to the
north by numerous footpaths which skirted the vulnerable coastlands. It
was to this area that Ham Nghi and his diminished retinue eventually
retired. French units coming down from Vinh moved into the hills in
December 1885 and again in January 1886. Each time, however, they
lacked the resources to stay in the area, while several successful ambushes
against them raised the popular prestige of local partisans (nghia quan)
to the point where Ton That Thuyet was allegedly turning back
volunteers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a>

</p>

<p>

There was a weakness to this particular region, nevertheless, which
the French would quickly learn to exploit. Of an estimated fourty thousand
residents in the Gianh River valley itself perhaps one-fourth were
practicing Catholics. Considerable blood had already spilled between
Catholic and non-Catholic villages before 1885. Now Ton That Thuyet
did nothing to discourage the destruction of churches, and French units
hardly intervened when local Catholics burned pagodas. Memories of the
killing, raping, and pillaging of this period would still be alive in the middle
of the twentieth century. After a while, the French had no difficulty
in persuading whole Catholic communities to move and cluster at key
lowland junctions, where small forts could be erected, colonial troop units
could be trained, and terror or counterterror expeditions could be organized.
In February 1886 French units, striking by surprise with the aid of
an informer, almost caught Ham Nghi in a pagoda where be had been
residing for some months. Ham Nghi fled west into the mountains, but the
destruction and demoralization wrought by this enemy sortie seems to
have convinced Ton that his only long-term hope was once again to
“knock at the gates” of the Middle Kingdom. Leaving his two sons as personal
guardians of the king, he set off for the border to request assistance.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a>

</p>

<p>

In the meantime, however, uprisings in north Vietnam induced the
French to shift some of their units up there again. This gave Quang Binh
resistance units under Le True, the former governor of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Hanoi</a>, the opportunity
to roam the coastal lowlands almost at will until late in 1886.
After that the net tightened perceptibly, with the French even managing
to establish a fort square in the midst of Le.Truc’s home area. Replying
to French letters offering lenient surrender terms, Le True castigated the
French policy of turning Vietnamese Catholic (giao) against non-Catholic
(Iuong) by using priests to lead invasions and spread religious turmoiJ.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> 
During the Tet holidays of 1887 a French patrol was led by an informer
to the hideout of one of Le True’s prime mandarin associates, Nguyen
Pham Tuan.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> His death and the increasing viciousness of French and
Catholic terrorism in local villages marked the beginning of the end in
Quang Binh. Spies were everywhere, demoralized resistance units fell
prey to nighttime attacks (in one of these Le True’s wife and children
were captured), and Ham Nghi let himself be gradually boxed in rather
than leaving for other areas to the north.

</p>

<p>

Ham Nghi had the additional problem in his upper mountain retreat of
being heavily dependent on villagers of the Muong tribal minority, a people
who had not been treated kindly under the _rule of his royal predecessors.
In the end the French developed a complex plot with a Muong
follower of Ham Nghi, whereby the king would be betrayed for some
opium and a minor military title. In these more and more desperate circumstances,
some of the youngest resistance leaders turned out to be the
most fanatically determined and ioyal. Ham Nghi (then sixteen years
old) was finally surprised and captured in November 1888 but not before
Ton’s sixteen-year-old son, Ton That Thiep had been slain at his feet.
Ton’s eldest son, Ton That Dam (twenty), upon hearing the news at a
nearby defensive position, instructed his followers to disperse, wrote a
letter of apology to Ham Nghi, and committed suicide in a pagoda.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a>
Ham Nghi, sounded out by his French captors to see whether he would
“cooperate,” refused to answer to his name or to express any willingness
to meet his relatives in Hue. He was subsequently put aboard a ship for
a life of exile in Algeria.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a>

</p>

<p>

The next resistance area to the north included most of Ha Tinh, Nghe
An, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, all cordoned off from points south by concentrations
of French troops, although liaison was maintained by the mountain footpaths.
First to recruit local forces in support of Ham Nghi was a young
Ha Tinh man named Le Ninh (often known as Am Ninh), one of the
few Can Vuong leaders without civil examination credentials, but nevertheless
of rather wealthy parentage. Moving swiftly, he and his band
stormed the Ha Tinh provincial seat and executed a mandarin who had
declared his opposition to the Can Vuong Edict. Word of this exploit
having stimulated his recruiting, Le Ninh set up headquarters in his home
village of Trung-Le. However, attacks on several Catholic villages failed,
and fortune turned against Le Ninh. His entire village was wiped from the
face of the map, the survivors being either jailed or resettled. Le Ninh
himself managed to flee to the hills, where he died of illness the next
year.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> His followers soon entered the ranks of the more sophisticated
organization of Phan Dinh Phung.

</p>
<br><br>
<p>

A man of different status led early Can Vuong efforts in Nghe An
province. Nguyen Xuan On (1825-1889), often called Nghe On, had
achieved tien-szi<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> rank in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1871</a> and served as prefect (tri-phu), provincial
education commissioner (doc-hoc), and provincial judge (an-sat) before
turning in his seal of office to go recruit resistance forces in his home
province.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> In December 1885 his concerted attack on the French garrison
at Vinh was thwarted by reinforcements from Ninh Binh. In December
1886 and January 1887 Nguyen Xuan On did whatever he could
to take enemy pressure off <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> and the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> defense complex,
causing the French to divert at least one unit south to Vinh to curtail
his attacks. Weapons and ammunition, particularly sulphur for gunpowder,
seem to have been at a premium in the area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> In May 1887 the
French captured one of his bodyguards and forced the man to lead a
surprise assault on Nguyen Xuan On’s headquarters. Nguyen was captured,
refused entreaties to collaborate, was transferred to Hue in a
cage, and died in jail two years later.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> He left behind a volume of poems,
one of which I attempt to translate here:
</p>
<blockquote>
Cam Tac (Touching Impressions)
Wherefore our land of perpetual trouble?
Half is Heaven’s doing, half is man’s.
The barbarians could terrorize the Chin<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a>
Yet three clans could also overthrow the Ch’in.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>
Peace offerings of jade and silk simply made things worse.
Yet how many have dared to thump oars,
brandish spears to kill the enemy?
How odd: from old mandarin cap and gown,
To all those people running around in savage
barbarian clothing!<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>

In the first three years in central Vietnam by far the most important
Can Vuong effort centered in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> province, particularly around
the village bastion of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a>, adjacent to the road connecting the central
and northern parts of the country (see Map 2) . In essence this was a
carefully planned, well executed position defense ’of three integrated villages,
aided by the surrounding maze of swamps, mud flats, and high
bamboo thickets. As such, it was bound to fail, given complete French
superiority in artillery and naval gunfire. Still, there are aspects of this resistance
wbich deserve more than passing mention. First, there was the
precise, studied manner in which scholar-gentry from throughout the
province&#8212;not just the local district&#8212;agreed on <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> as the most
defensible position, selected a scholar-gentry commander-in-chief, and
parceled out jobs to units in other villages. They then devoted several
mont~s to directing the construction of fortifications, for which they drew
supplies and labor from villages many miles away. For example, each village
in the districts of Nga-Son and Tong-Son contributed thirty large
wicker baskets, one hundred bamboo poles, and ten shoulder-pole loads
of straw.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> Thousands of peasants dug a moat around the entire complex
and piled the mud up to make a wall, using straw as the strengthening
agent. Behind this, one or more shorter defense rings were constructed.
The wicker baskets took the place of sandbags; they were filled with dirt
and used in the construction of firing embrasures. Most of the bamboo
poles formed multiple rings of spikes around the position, many of them
under water.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a>

</p>

<p>

The commander-in-chief, an 1884 cu-nhan<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> graduate and doc-hoc
named Pham Banh, was wise enough to know his military limitations: he
delegated all tactical authority to Dinh Cong Trang, a nonmandarin from
outside <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, with considerable guerilla experience and a small,
tough band of his own. While skirmishes occurred from October 1886
onward, the French only moved in seriously in December, first cutting
off access routes and forcing in Vietnamese outposts, and then launching
a major assault on December 18. Several units did penetrate the outer
defenses, but they were pinned down and isolated and their officers killed
or wounded. Hasty withdrawals finally were executed under cover of 81
millimeter cannon fire. French forces then marked time while distant
reinforcements were called on, building up by early January 1887 to some
fifteen hundred French and one thousand native colonial troops, plus
four gunboats and five thousand coolies recruited from the Catholic villages
of Phat-Diem.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a>

</p>

<p>

Their next full-scale assault, on January 6, proved to be even more disastrous
for the French. Using explosives to clear holes in the bamboo
hedges, several units again penetrated the outer defenses and again were
isolated and forced to retreat under artillery cover. Reluctantly settling
then for classic seige tactics, the French built their own impressive counterfortifications
closer and closer to the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> resisters, bombarding
incessantly and even using oil slick fires in the moats and swamps to
destroy the bamboo hedges and force back snipers. Captain J. J. C. Joffre
(later a marshal) commanded the engineer units which undertook most
of these seige efforts, even as pressure was building from higher authorities
to finish the campaign before political repercussions occurred in metropolitan
France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> At this point Dinh Cong T~ang sent word out to other
resistance units in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, particularly to one of about two thousand
men a half-day’s march away, calling for major actions to divert some of
the French seige force. The best response he got was some ineffectual light
harassing fire from the outside. Informal cooperative arrangements had
been adequate in the planning and preparation stages, but in actual engagement
there was no substitute for a unified area command.

</p>

<p>

By this time both sides were suffering the ill effects of the scores&#8212;perhaps
hundreds&#8212;of unburied bodies strewn around the defense works.
Cholera was beginning to spread rapidly. On the night of January 20
Dinh ordered his troops to break out at all costs and head for another
carefully chosen defense position to the west, this one on high ground and
protected on several sides by a deep, rapidly flowing river. It was a bloody
escape, however, and the French gave them no time to rest or regroup.
The new position was hit February 2, forcing resistance remnants to
retreat southward several days later. Pham Banh surrendered to gain
release of his mother and his children and then immediately committed
suicide. Dinh Cong Trang escaped to Nghe-An, where he was killed later
in 1887. The three villages of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> were ordered razed and their names
removed from government maps. Physically, nothing remained of BaDinh
but a hump of earth amidst overgrown fields; but spiritually&#8212;that
was another matter.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a>

</p>

<p>

Whereas resistance in central Vietnam from Quang-Binh northward
was widespread and occasionally systematic, the action from Quang-Tri
all the way south to Binh-Thuan appears to have been episodic, allowing
the French to delegate most pacification duties to their mandarin collaborators.
Catholic enclaves in Quang Tri were the scene of some acrimonious
encounters in September 1885, as local scholar-gentry circulated
copies of the 1883 royal ordinance urging village logistical support of
the resistance and then took the provincial fortress without opposition
and distributed the weapons and ammunition to their followers. This was
apparently the signal for partisans throughout Quang Tri to move against
the nearest Catholics, pillaging and burning houses and killing those who
did not recant or flee to their churches. In several cases the churches
themselves were set afire, with hundreds of persons being burned alive.
Native Vietnamese priests were captured and forced, sometimes under
torture, to admit that they had “called the French into their country.”
The seminary at An Ninh, overflowing with four thousand refugees, managed
to defend itself against perhaps three thousand partisans employing
cannon and desultory seige tactics. In reaction to this, General de Courcy
marched up from Hue and quickly reoccupied the fortress, but it was
almost a month before he had enough troops to relieve such Catholic outposts
as An Ninh. Subsequent retributions against non-Catholics were
equally bitter, and memories of this episode also continued to haunt the
people of Quang Tri well into the twentieth century.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a>

</p>

<p>

The strongest sustained effort south of Quang Binh may have been in
Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh, but even there the defection of a prime
scholar-gentry leader and some of his following exposed the other scholar-
gentry to rapid extermination.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> In 
Quang Nam the Can Vuong leaders
in the end came to question each other’s loyalty, which led, among other
things to the killing of the father of Phan Chu Trinh, one of the prime
leaders of the next anticolonial generation. In Binh Thuan the French
employed the services of the infamous native pacification expert from
Cochinchina, Tran Ba Loc, to destroy and pillage all suspected villages.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a>

</p>

<p>

When looked at from the French side, the decade after 1887 in central
Vietnam was one of gradual but definite progress in the consolidation and
rationalization of colonial rule. By this time the bulk of the royal family
and a fair proportion of the scholar-gentry had reluctantly accepted foreign
domination as a fait accompli, a fortunate thing for the French, since
there is some doubt that they could have financially sustained a top-heavy
system of direct rule in the center like that imposed on the south. Until
1895 there would still be a substantial, if manageable, financial drain for
the training and maintaining of military forces in their efforts to wipe out
the last major pockets of resistance. Increasingly, however, the French
were able to rework the local tax structure so that not only did Vietnamese
kill other Vietnamese for the foreigner, but they bore the financial
costs of the operation as well.

</p>

<p>

<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>, after the collapse of the resistance centered around BaDinh,
was seemingly quiescent until early 1889. At that point Tong Duy
Tan, a tien-si and former doc-hoc in his own home province of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>,
as well as an early Can Vuong mountain base commander, returned from
hiding and roused the scholar-gentry of several districts to dig and supply
another major fortified position. The first colonial patrol sent to investigate
was ambushed October 8, 1889, suffering heavy casualties. A larger force
returned after several days, but had to withdraw under fire. This brought
a French colonel with one hundred and eighty-five French troops, who on
October 22 forced the resistance units to flee their fortifications. However,
word of these exploits had spread, causing risings and even some sustained
assaults on French camps and posts from December through March 1890
in other parts of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a>. Propaganda leaflets were distributed among
Vietnamese serving in colonial units, implying imminent assistance for the
anticolonials in north Vietnam from China and Germany and appealing
for an end to Catholic/non-Catholic fratricide in the common cause of
throwing out the foreigner. If soldiers did not feel they could actively join
the resistance, then they were advised to return to their families and turn
over their weapons to those who had joined, in exchange for cash.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a>

</p>

<p>

On both sides of this new <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> conflict, however, the numbers of
participants never seem to have approached those in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Ba-Dinh</a> effort.
By April 1890 the French were able to mount a long series of counterattacks
and succeeded in smashing or scattering the main resistance units
by the end of that year. Tong Duy Tan and his prime associate, Cao Dien,
held together a force of perhaps one hundred men and fifty rifles until
1892, at which time Tong was captured and executed and Cao forced to
flee to north Vietnam, where he was caught in 1896.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a>

</p>

<p>

In Nghe An and Ha Tinh the French crushing of the initial risings and
capture of Ham Nghi in 1888 had deeply stunned the scholar-gentry. On
the one hand, this tended to stimulate significant new defections to Hue.
On the other hand, however, it set the minority to developing a more sophisticated,
long-term concept of resistance. The soul of this resistance
would be Phan Dinh Phung, the highest ranking court official after Ton
That Thuyet to take part fully in the Can Vuong movement. The muscle,
the elan, and the tactical expertise of this effort,. would above all reside in
Cao Thang, a young bandit leader of decidedly nongentry background,
whom Phan’s brother had protected from royal troops ten years earlier.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a>

</p>

<p>

Phan Dinh Phung was born in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1847</a> in Dong-Thai village, La-Son district,
Ha Tinh province. Dong-Thai village had a reputation for producing
high mandarins far back into the Le dynasty, and the Phan family could
boast successful examinees and mandarins in each of twelve generations
before Phan Dinh Phung. All three of Phan’s brothers who lived to adulthood
passed exams and became mandarins. Phan himself gave early indications
of a real distaste for classical learning. Nevertheless, he was determined
to follow the traditional route, passing the regional exams in
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1876</a> and then receiving highest honors in the metropolitan exams of the
following year. Finally, in the court exams King Tu Due asked a specific
question about the reasons behind the West’s rapid military progress; Phan
is reputed to have cited Japan as an Eastern country already demonstrating
clearly what Vietnam could do if she had the will. There was no reason,
he argued, why the West should keep a monopoly on military skills.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a>

</p>

<p>

For all his scholastic success, Phan would never be known for his literary
ability.It was his reputation for courage and stiff integrity that raised
him quickly to the top and kept him his devoted following unto the very
end in 1895. In his first position as a district mandarin in Ninh-Binh province,
Phan saw fit to punish a native Catholic priest, who allegedly had
terrorized local non-Catholics with implicit support from the French.
Amidst the subsequent diplomatic furor, Phan is said to have avoided
blaming the hated alliance between local Catholics and French on the nature
of Catholicism itself, feeling rather that this collaboration had developed
out of the military and political weakness of Vietnam’s central
government. Nevertheless, the end result was a bowing by Hue to French
pressure and the removal of Phan as district mandarin and his reassignment
to the court as a member of the censorate (Do-Sat-Vien).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[54]</a> There
Phan earned the enmity of many but the trust of his king by revealing to
Tu Due that virtually all court mandarins were making a mockery of royal
orders to engage in periodic rifle practice.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[55]</a> After this Tu Due sent Phan
on an inspection trip to north Vietnam, and his report led, among other
things, to the king’s cashiering the viceroy for that entire area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a>

</p>

<p>

Despite his prominence in the last years of Tu Due’s reign, it is not clear
from the evidence just where Phan Dinh Phung stood on the overriding
court questions of “attack, defense, or negotiation” with the French. Given
subsequent events, we might assume that he stood in the “war party”
with Ton That Thuyet. Yet he almost lost his head&#8212;literally&#8212;just after
the death of Tu Due for trying to oppose Ton’s palace coup which set aside
Tu Due’s will of succession. Phan was lucky merely to have been imprisoned
and stripped of his positions; and he eventually was allowed to leave
Hue for home.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> There Phan seems to have avoided public recriminations
with Ton, for example, accepting secret responsibility for building up
mountain bases in Ha-Tinh long before Ham Nghi’s flight from Hue.
Rather than sharing Ton’s lingering hopes for another Ch’ing intervention,
Phan toyed with ideas of major assistance from Siam, recalling a sister of
King Gia Long who long before had married the king of that country. But
the most that ever came of this, much later, was several pack trains of guns
and ammunition.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a>

</p>

<p>

In the first period of Can Vuong activity after July 1885 Phan used his
home village as nerve center, setting up a small weapons factory and using
local scholar-gentry as troop commanders. Their first serious attack was
aimed at two nearby Catholic villages. French troops arrived some hours
later and chased them all the way back to their home village, where retribution
naturally was heavy. Phan Dinh Phung escaped, but his elder
brother was later captured by his old enemy, the cashiered viceroy of north
Vietnam, who by this time was serving the French as governor of Nghe-An.
The device used against Phan was classic, the pressing of an old friend and
fellow villager into writing an impassioned, deeply Confucian appeal to
Phan to surrender himself to save his elder brother, his family’s tombs, and
&#8212;indeed&#8212;his entire village. Phan is said to have told his lieutenants:

</p>

<blockquote>
From the time I joined with you in the Can Vuong movement, I
determined to forget questions of family and village. Now I have but
one tomb, a very large one, that must be defended: the land of Vietnam.
I have only one brother, very important, that is in danger: more than
twenty million countrymen. If I worry about my own tombs, who will
worry about defending the tombs of the rest of the country? If I save
my own brother, who will save all the other brothers of our country?
There is only one way for me to die now.

</blockquote>

<p>
After this he is reported simply to have written his former friend, “if anyone
carves up my brother, remember to send me some of the soup.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a>

</p>

<p>

This incident helps illustrate why Phan Dinh Phung became important
to later generations of anticolonial leaders for his apparent identification
with a countrywide cause, far removed from questions of family and region.
It would be too much to conclude that Phan was expressing a revolutionary
ethic, since this problem of competing loyalties, of particular
versus universal values, was also a theme in traditional Confucian literature.
Whatever the wellsprings, however, no one can deny that Phan’s actions
and the statements attributed to him came to symbolize the highest
personal standards of Vietnamese patriotism.

</p>

<p>

In 1887, considering his efforts up to that time to be ill-conceived, Phan
ordered Cao Thang and other subordinates to cease open conflict and
concentrate on building a solid network of base camps, food caches, intelligence
agents, and peasant supply contacts. He himself set out for north
Vietnam, hoping to coordinate strategy with scholar-gentry leaders there.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a>
While Phan’s mission ended in failure, Cao Thang in his absence achieved
wonders, carefully reorganizing a main force of one thousand men
equipped with five hundred firearms. Interestingly enough, besides possessing
a variety of older firearms, Cao Thang captured several mo~el <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1874</a>
French rifles, disassembled them personally, and then supervised the
manufacture (by Vietnamese artisans kidnapped for the purpose) of perhaps
three hundred and fifty copies. According to French officers who captured
some later and sent them home for analysis, these copies were proficiently
done in every detail except for the tempering of the springs, which
were made from umbrella spokes, and the lack of rifling in the barrels,
which naturally cut down their effective range and their accuracy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a>

</p>

<p>

Phan Dinh Phung and Cao Thang had in fact picked the only area in
central Vietnam where prolonged resistance was feasible after 1888. The
mountainous western borders of Ha-Tinh, Nghe-An, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Thanh Hoa</a> were
redolent with the history of dynastic and antiforeign struggle. We may
surmise that Phan thought of himself in a role somewhat akin to that of
Le Loi, more than four centuries earlier. In much the same area, both
of them attempted to build small, disciplined guerrilla forces that offered
political alternatives to collaboration. Both patiently endured the worst
trials, waiting for the proper moment to strike into the lowlands, gain local
gentry support, and then sweep north or south to ultimate victory.

</p>

<p>

Small remnants of risings in other locations did gravitate to the leadership
of Phan Dinh Phung and Cao Thang. A command headquarters was
established at Vu-Quang, and fifteen other bases were strung along the
mountains, each with a subordinate commander and one hundred to five
hundred men. A sophisticated balance of centralized command and unit
dispersion undoubtedly was one reason that this resistance lasted so long.
For much of the time a land tax in both silver and rice was levied by the
movement, local bases essentially being supported by nearby villages and
any excess going to Vu-Quang. Cinnamon bark was collected and sold,
while lowlanders gave whatever steel, iron, and brass they had to help in
the production of weapons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a>

</p>

<p>

Upon Phan Dinh Phung’s return from the north in 1889, the first order
of business was to track down the Muong betrayer of King Ham Nghi and
behead him. This accomplished, there commenced a series of inconclusive
small-unit engagements lasting through the summer of 1890, with the
French mostly relying on district and provincial colonial units ( kho-xanh)
to man their ever-expanding string of local forts, each usually under the
command of a French lieutenant. In late 18 90 there was an ineffective
French effort to move into the villages and isolate them from the mountain
bases. A major French sweep in the spring of 1892 in Ha-Tinh failed however,
and in August Cao Thang mounted an audacious counterattack on
the province seat of Ha-Tinh, freeing compatriots in the jail and killing
a large proportion of the native colonial defenders. This apparently led the
French to conduct a counteroffensive during the remainder of 1892, pushing
resistance units back into the mountains and forcing them to abandon
two mountain bases. While still unable to pin down resistance units, steady
French pressure from that time onward did begin to snap covert resistance
links with lowland villages, thus compounding the problems of securing
food, supplies, intelligence data, recruits, and so on. A ring of enemy forts
kept tightening around the remaining base camps. The only bright aspect
was the rather plentiful supply of gunpowder, brought in by pack train
from Siam under the direction of a resourceful female member of the resistance.
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> This enabled them to mix foreign and local powder on a fifty-fifty
basis, compared with the previous weak twenty-eighty mixture.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a>

</p>

<p>

At this point Cao Thang, either wearying of guerrilla conflict or sensing
the ultimate decline of their movement, proposed to Phan Dinh Phung in
open council a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of Nghe An and the
surrounding posts. His plan included diversions to the south and the training
of almost two thousand men in conventional military maneuvers. The
troops were eager, but Phan seems to have approved the scheme much
against his better judgment. Even though Le Loi’s successful attack on
Nghe An in 1425 represented an obvious precedent, Phan must have
known that the chances this time were slim. After overcoming several small
posts en route, their main force was pinned down in an attack on the key
fort of No on September 9, 1893. Leading a desperate frontal assault with
one hundred and fifty men, Cao Thang fell mortally wounded along with
his brother, and the troops retreated in total confusion. Cao Thang had
simply been unable to control and sustain the momentum of such an ambitious
attack. His relationship with his men had always been personal,
not structural, and his previous successes had come from a combination of
meticulous planning and small-unit surprise.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a>

</p>

<p>

Phan Dinh Phung quickly perceived the significance of this loss, as is
revealed in his eulogy and funeral oration for Cao Thang.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> From as early
as 1889 there is reason to believe that Phan had clearly understood both
the advantages and the limitations of prolonged resistance. Although he
may have doubted that he or anyone else could evict the French in his
lifetime, he still saw certain long-term advantages both in threatening
them and in maintaining a viable alternative to the defeatism and venality
emanating from Hue. Now, however, he was unlikely even to present a
threat to the French anymore. All that remained, thus, was the symbolism
of demonstrating to his contemporaries and to subsequent generations
a total unwillingness to accept servility, whether physical or spiritual.

</p>

<p>

French administrators may not have perceived Phan’s intent. But high
mandarin collaborators did&#8212;and none of them better than Hoang Cao
Khai, viceroy of Tonkin and member of yet another prestigious scholar-gentry
family from Phan Dinh Phung’s village of Dong-Thai in Ha-Tinh
province. It was Hoang who then became a prime sponsor of all-out efforts
to crack Phan’s resistance campaign once and for all, by using every political,
psychological, and economic device available. By late 1894 suspected
supporters in the lowlands and relatives of participants in the
resistance had been thoroughly terrorized, several more resistance commanders
had been killed, and their communications had been broken. No
base area was secure. The Phan family tombs had been dug up and all
available relatives jailed.

</p>

<p>

One of those relatives was selected to carry a long message from Hoang
-cao Khai to Phan Dinh Phung. Rather surprisingly, Phan sent a written
reply, so we are extremely fortunate in having a last highly charged, yet
subtle exchange between traditional mandarin paragons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[67]</a> Hoang’s letter
recalled their common origins and promised intercession with Governor
General J. M. A. De Lannessan and other French officials. He credited
Phan with selfless dedication, righteousness, and loyalty toward the monarch:

</p>

<blockquote>
But now the situation has changed’ and even those without intelligence
or education have concluded that nothing remains to be saved. How is it
that you, a man of vast understanding, do not realize this? But I seem to
perceive your reasoning. You are determined to do whatever you deem
righteous. You give all your efforts and talents to the cause you consider
just. And yet, although it is in a man’s power to undertake any enterprise,
its outcome depends upon the will of Heaven. All that matters
indeed is the giving of one’s life to one’s country. No one therefore can
deter you from your goal.
<br><br>
The subject I should now like to introduce is the suffering imposed upon
our country .... I have always been taught that superior men should
consider the care of the people as fundamental; who has ever heard of
men who were loyal to their King but forgot the people’s aspirations?
... I would understand your resistance, did you involve but your family
for the benefit of a large number! As of now, hundreds of families are
subject to grief; how do you have the heart to fight on? I venture to
predict that, should you pursue your struggle, not only will the population
of our village be destroyed but our entire country will be
transformed into a sea of blood and a mountain of bones.

</blockquote>

<p>
Phan Dinh Phung’s reply was a classic in savage understatement, utilizing
standard formalism in the interests of propaganda, with deft denigration
of his opponent. Recalling Vietnam’s struggles against Han, T’ang
Sung, Yuan, and Ming, he asked why even China, sharing a common border
and “a thousand times more powerful than Vietnam,” could not succeed
in swallowing the Vietnamese. “It was surely because the destiny
of our country has been willed by Heaven itself.” Implicitly, the French,
coming from much farther away, would discover this for themselves.

</p>

<p>

To Hoang’s statements about popular grief and suffering, Phan retorted
that responsibility for this must rest with the French, who “acted like
a storm," forced the king to flee, and cast the country into disorder.

</p>

<blockquote>
Our rivers and our mountains have been annexed by them at a stroke and
turned into a foreign territory. <i> These events affected the whole country,
the entire population. It is not any particular region or any particular
family alone that has suffered this trial.</i> [My emphasis.]
</blockquote>

<p>
After reviewing his personal actions and stressing the loyalty of his followers
as a factor in continuing the struggle, Phan concluded with a stinging
rebuke to Hoang and all collaborators:

</p>

<blockquote>

If our region has suffered to such an extent, it was not only from the misfortunes
of war. You must realize that wherever the French go, there
flock around them groups of petty men who offer plans and tricks to gain
the enemy’s confidence. These persons create every kind of enmity; they
incriminate innocent persons, blaming one one day, punishing another
the next. They use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their possessions.
That is how hundred of misdeeds, thousands of offenses have
been perpetrated.
</blockquote>

<p>

Quite clearly, Hoang’s particularistic appeals had been countered with
an appeal to history, a demand that blame for death and destruction rest
with the foreign intruder, and an important raising of the stakes, above
family and village• to the entire country and people. The arena was not
Dong-Thai village or Ha-Tinh province, but Vietnam itself.

</p>

<p>

Hoang Cao Khai translated both letters into French and presented them
to De Lanessan with the recommendation that it was time for final “destruction
of this scholar-gentry rebellion.” In July 1895 French area
commanders brought together three thousand troops to tighten the noose
around three remaining base areas. Several times, resistance units succeeded
in executing skillful ambushes and night withdrawals, but Phan
was by this time wracked with dysentery and had to be carried when his
unit moved every three or four days. A collaborator mandarin named
Nguyen Than, with previous pacification experience in Quang Ngai and
Quang Nam provinces, was brought in to cut the last links with the villages
and to attempt to buy off Phan Dinh Phung’s subordinates.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a> The men
were now living on roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn and were
desperate for salt; their shoes were rotted out, and most were without
blankets. A few committed suicide. Phan himself died of dysentery, probably
on January 21, 1896; later, twenty-five followers who surrendered
were taken to Hue and executed. Nguyen TtJan, following traditional precedent
for “bandits,” managed to find Phan’s grave, burn the corpse, and
fire the ashes out of a cannon.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> The soul of resistance to the protectorate
was gone, said the triumphant report submitted by the governor general
to the Minister of Colonies in Paris.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a>

</p>
<br><br>
<p>

Can Vuong efforts in north Vietnam, while different in approach from
those of the center, were nonetheless just as important in sustaining the
resistance ethic and in setting specific precedents for future generations.
In contrast with people in most of central Vietnam, people in the north
had been living amidst war and chaos for some years already. Conflict
in north Vietnam immediately after Ham Nghi’s flight from Hue in July
1885 was hard to separate from French efforts to terminate the SinoFrench
conflict and consolidate their hold in a few key areas. Promulgation
of the Can Vuong Edict merely signaled another round of deadly
conflict. This time, however, the moral climate was more invigorating.
Confusion bred by Hue’s decades of indecisive diplomacy was swept
away. Popular resistance was now legitimate. It was either fight or collaborate&#8212;
with no room in the middle.

</p>

<p>

In general, Can Vuong command relations in the north were even
less structured than were those in central Vietnam, because newly energized
royalist scholar-gentry had to place themselves in a more intimate
and even dependent relationship with those forces, antidynastic and otherwise,
which had been active well before 1885. Leaders of those forces
already possessed an appreciation of the strategic significance of mountainous
areas_~long the Sino-Vietnamese border. Even for groups choosing
to resist in the Red River delta, it was a great advantage to receive
the small but steady flow of arms and supplies from across the Chinese
border, until about 1894 when the Ch’ing authorities finally moved to
cut off such traffic. In the north there also was considerably more room
to maneuver, and it took the French a much longer time to extend their
strings of forts up the main valleys and along the frontiers there than in
the central provinces. When in 1896 the French succeeded in neutralizing
the Yen-The area and bringing some last mountain commanders to
heel, it was the end of the entire Can Vuong movement.

</p>

<p>

The man selected by Ham Nghi and his advisors to coordinate all resistance
in north Vietnam was a tien-si from Nam-Dinh province named
Nguyen Quang Bich.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> Nguyen’s earlier career had included holding positions
as an-sat (provincial judge) of Son-Tay province, where in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1873</a>
and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1874</a> he had worked closely with Liu Yung-fu’s Black Flags, and as
governor of Hung-Hoa, where failure in defending the local fort had led
him to organize local militia bands for sustained resistance. Now as Ham
Nghi’s representative he twice traveled into Yunnan seeking new Ch’ing
assistance, on one occasion at least bringing back six hundred firearms,
sixty boxes of ammunition, and two thousand catties of opium as convertible
currency.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> Later he received substantial arms shipments from
Ton That Thuyet, who had failed to persuade the Ch’ing to intervene
again but who was still able for some years to coordinate supply shipments
from China across the frontier.

</p>

<p>

In fact, China’s empress dowager, Tz’u-hsi, had decided to abandon
all semblances of traditional tributary relations with Vietnam. The SinoFrench
treaty signed June 9, 1885, reaffirmed the French protectorate and
specified that Vietnam was to conduct its relations with other countries
only through the intermediary of France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> However, 
either Vietnam’s
Can-Vuong resisters failed to understand the significance of Peking’s acquiescence
or they deliberately tried to influence China’s Ch’ing-i clique
to bring about another change of face in Peking. In 1886 a group of northern
Vietnamese scholar-gentry sent a petition to the Chinese governor
general of Yunnan and Kweichow for transmission to the emperor. As
with Nguyen Quang Bich and Ton That Thuyet, this was in the immediate
sense a desperate call for military assistance. But it also played heavily
on the Middle Kingdom’s sense of responsibility toward its vassals and
sought to prevent China from reaching any permanent understanding with
France that would jeopardize Vietnam. It explained why King Ham
Nghi had been forced to flee the capital and denigrated, by name, the
mandarins who had subsequently collaborated with the French in installing
Dong Khanh:

</p>

<blockquote>

Assuming a heavy responsibility toward his country, our King has decided
to resist and to seek a solution to his difficulties rather than remain
quiet and await the catastrophe. Wherever is our King, there is our
country. The other King, established by the French, is rather our enemy.
How can he appropriate temples and command the loyalty of the
gods and the people?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a>

</blockquote>

<p>
The Can Vuong generation, steeped in idealistic respect for traditional
Confucian morality, never quite recovered from the Middle Kingdom’s
final abandonment of Vietnam into barbarian hands. It was left to the
next generation to draw their own sobering conclusions.

</p>

<p>

Nguyen Quang Bich never tried seriously to organize a central command
for north Vietnam, and it is doubtful that he could have. He did
maintain regular liaison with resistance leaders in at least six provinces,
but this does not appear to have produced much coordinated activity.
The French tried to buy Nguyen Quang Bich off and, failing this, jailed his
mother. Nevertheless, his resistance efforts continued until his death of
natural causes in 1890.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> Following 
are portions of his letter answering the
French offers, which doubtless are representative of Can Vuong political
thinking:

</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
You [Frenchmen] came to look our country over, displaying good techniques,
clever skills and a well-trained army. And on this basis it seems
that more than half of our people have left brightness and righteousness
in order to follow you. This land of long civilization, of countless mandarins
and proper ceremony has just about become French property. This
being the case, you may consider us extremely foolish for not having
measured our strength realistically, instead courting disaster by gathering
some hundreds of scholar-gentry [than-si] and several thousand exhausted
soldiers to oppose you. But we think repeatedly of the tie between
monarch and subject in this world, not shirking temporal responsibilities
that are as clearly defined as the waters of the Ching and the
Wei rivers<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-n">[76]</a> and we do not dare forget our obligations. It is simply this
tie that we must live up to.

<br><br>
When you first came to our country, you first talked of peaceful relations,
then of protecting us. But these were no more than the diversionary
tactics of a thief, subsequently allowing you to seize our fortresses, drive
out our King, his generals, and then on your own volition enthrone Dong
Khanh. Political authority is now completely in your hands. Civilian as
well as military officials have been detained and put under your control.
How could you have been more heartless? Calling it peaceful relations,
calling it protection, and then having it work out like this?! ...

<br><br>
As long as you continue to boast about your strength, your skills, we will
continue to refuse to give up our failures, our weaknesses. Then, if we
happen to win, to live, we will be the court’s righteous men [nghia-si]. If
we are unlucky enough to lose and die, we will still be supernatural devils
[qui-thieng] for killing bandits. Better to endure punishment from you
than ever think of punishment from our monarch. Better to be sentenced
once than be sentenced for eternity.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a>

</blockquote>
</p>

<p>

In the Red River delta the most sustained resistance occurred in
Hung-Yen, Hai-Duong, and Bac-Ninh provinces (see Map 2), with
the main base in Bai-Say (Plain of Reeds)-an area in Hung Yen that
had been well cultivated until the dikes had broken repeatedly during
Tu Due’s reign, turning it into a bandit’s lair.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> There 
the early leader
was Nguyen Thien Thuat, a native of Hung-Yen and a former mandarin,
who had departed angrily for China when Hue put pressure on him to
observe the treaties with France. Upon hearing of the Can Vuong Edict,
he returned and quickly organized forces to threaten several enemy communication
routes, the emphasis always on mobile, small-unit attacks
rather than defense of fixed positions. Up through 1887 the French were
too occupied in central Vietnam to threaten Bai-Say, but in 1888 they
organized a special native colonial force under Viceroy Hoang Cao Khai
to mount attacks on nearby villages and slowly to isolate the regular resistance
units. Nguyen Thien Thuat now turned command over to his
younger brother and another deputy in order to return to China in search
of help from Liu Yung-fu and his Black Flags. Fighting was bitter and
widespread through 1888, but by 1889 the noose was drawn tight, and
a number of Vietnamese leaders had been captured or had surrendered.
Remnants managed to flee to Yen-The, where Hoang Hoa Tham was
just beginning his fight.

</p>

<p>

Between 1885 and 1889 the French were vaguely aware that pacification
of the Tonkin lowlands depended ultimately on controlling the
surrounding hills and mountains. Without this control small resistance
units could always slip out for rest and regroupment and then filter back
with new weapons and supplies. Perhaps more important, as long as
resistance continued in the hills, the vast bulk of Vietnamese in the delta
would have adequate psychological rationale for refusing to accept colonial
rule as ultimate, final, and without alternative. Up through 1890
the French lacked the means to control these hills and instead merely
seized strategic points along the frontier (Mong-Cai, Lang-Son, CaoBang,
Bao-Lac, Ha-Giang, Lao-Cai) and tried to keep open the main
communication routes out of the delta (the Red, Da, and Lo rivers and
Lang-Son road). The only exception I know of was their early moves
to control the Tam-Dao spine of hills, which points like a knife deep into
the delta.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a>

</p>

<p>

Thus, in 1890 most of north Vietnam’s midlands and highlands were
essentially autonomous, containing a fantastic conglomeration of ethnic
Vietnamese, remnant Chinese, Nung, Thai, Muong, Meo, and other tribal
groups&#8212;none owing firm allegiance to anyone above the district or provincial
level. It was not an easy period for anyone&#8212;above all, the more
peaceful peasants trying to make a living in the valleys and the less warlike
of the tribal villages on the slopes. Guns were the primary “instrument
of communication,” and stability existed only where various small
armed bands had worked out temporary arrangements with each other.

</p>

<p>

Such armed bands have come down in French history books as
<i>pirates</i> and <i>rebelles</i>, while more recent Vietnamese historians generally
have hailed them as patriots and righteous armies (nghia-quan). Without
wishing to get involved in this semantic quarrel, for which there is a
voluminous history, it should be stated in passing that the French had
little justification for calling the kettle black, for labeling someone else as
<i>pirates</i>, considering the manner in which they took over all of Vietnam
and the spurious attitudes they developed toward the people of the area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
On the other hand, present-day Vietnamese historians should be prepared
to recognize that most of the leaders of these mountain bands operating
after 1890 had motives which differed in degree, if not in kind, from
representatives of the traditional elite like Pham Banh, Tong Duy Tan,
Phan Dinh Phung, and Nguyen Thien Thuat.

</p>

<p>

Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is to outline the career of one
of the most colorful and certainly the longest surviving of these mountain
leaders: Hoang Hoa Tham, better known as De Tham, the “tiger of YenThe."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a>
 De Tham apparently was a peasant from Hung-Yen, where his
father had found reason in the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">early 1840s</a> to join an antidynastic group
in the nearby mountains of Son-Tay. There De Tham’s father and mother
were both captured by Nguyen forces in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1846</a>, she being executed on the
spot and he allegedly committing suicide en route by biting his tongue, a
traditional method. A paternal uncle raised the only son, the future De
Tham, by fleeing to the Yen-The area and changing the family name from
Truong to Hoang.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> Yen-The was host to local bands, Black Flags, and
vigilante units well before the first French penetrations of north Vietnam
in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">1873</a> and the Sino-French hostilities between 1883 and 1885. Serving
in a variety of groups for an unspecified time, De Tham eventually became
a minor leader with an increasing reputation for bravery and cunning.
As other leaders were killed or bought off by the French, and
particularly as the failures of scholar-gentry campaigns in the populated
lowlands sent remnants into the hills, De Tham and a handful of other
autonomous leaders took on greater stature. Also, as local French authorities
appropriated land in the valleys, some peasants gathered around
De Tham because he promised them restitution and showed a general
willingness to aid the poor.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a> It was largely this constant reservoir of
armed men in the Yen-The area that allowed De Tham to recoup and
reform his resistance after repeated setbacks.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a>

</p>

<p>

Yen-The saw its first really serious enemy•penetration between November
1890 and January 1891, with French forces building up to a total of
thirteen hundred troops and forcing resistance units to retreat farther into
the mountains. More weapons and ammunition were secured from China,
using cattle and lumber as exchange. But the French hit hard again in
early 1892, employing overwhelming artillery fire to crack a key mountain
fortress and seize fifteen thousand kilograms of com and rice. Relentless
pressure brought some resistance bands to surrender and others to work
out live-and-let-live arrangements with the French. By December 1893
the famous Colonel Joseph Gallieni (later a general) was in charge of a
high-priority political/military plan to eliminate or at least neutralize De
Tham and his remaining allies. 85 Considerable friction developed at this
point between French civilian and military echelons, the former willing
to make local deals with the “bandits” so that they could concentrate on
their primary interests, which were the seizure of land for plantations and
the completion of the Lang-Son railroad.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a>

</p>

<p>

A great amount of plotting and counterplotting ensued among the
Vietnamese, those leaders who had gone over to the French trying to
assassinate the holdouts and vice versa. Meanwhile, Gallieni was carefully
constructing a web of forts and supply posts around the area, plus
a series of military roads penetrating it. Each time he drove his enemy
out of a valley, he would have a fort constructed and try to persuade the
local people, by force or otherwise, to break all links with the resistance.
Since men like De Tham hardly had the scholar-gentry image of a Phan
Dinh Phung, or even the multigenerational ties that most scholar-gentry
resistance leaders had with surrounding villages, it is no surprise that
Gallieni enjoyed considerable success in the political aspects of dividing,
penetrating, and expanding his control of areas&#8212;which he called his
“oil-spot approach.” His success was temporarily halted, nevertheless,
in September 1894 by De Tham’s counterplay of attacking trains on the
Lang-Son line and kidnapping a very influential colon for ransom and a
military truce. To Gallieni’s chagrin, De Tham succeeded in making a
settlement with the French civilian administrators and proceeded to reconsolidate
a little quasi-feudal domain in the Yen-The area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a>

</p>

For all that, however, by late 1895 the civilian administrators were
again dissatisfied with arrangements, particularly in view of De Tham’s
attempts to infiltrate native colonial units and to extend his alliances to
other localities. Gallieni, who had seen to it that complete political and
military intelligence was maintained on the Yen-The situation, convinced
Governor General Paul-Armand Rousseau that he could resolve the problem
with a short, inexpensive operation, which in fact did force the
surrender of some resistance units and the dispersal of most others into
adjacent provinces. Nevertheless, random skirmishes in 1896 and an
inconclusive sweep of the area in 1897 demonstrated that a permanent
solution had eluded the French. Another deal was worked out, this one
considerably less advantageous to De Tham, yet at least allowing him to
continue for fifteen more years of plotting uprisings and assassinations
and occasionally providing aid and comfort to a later generation of anticolonial
leaders. After 1897 French military and political supremacy in
the pragmatic, “rational” sense made men like De Tham seem anachronisms.
But in the realm of popular mythology his cunning against such a
mighty foe became nothing short of supernatural. Young, angry intellectuals
came to study his tactics and admire his gall, if not his outdated
politics. He was something of a missing link, by his mere existence reminding
proud Vietnamese of martial values that the French would have
had them forget.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">88]</a>

There were other areas of resistance besides Yen-The after .1890, as
the French and their mandarin collaborators slowly penetrated the upper
valleys and mountain ranges. Along the Da River after 1889 resistance
seems to have increased with the arrival of new weapons from Ton That
Thuyet and the defection of some Vietnamese from colonial units. As
contact with the delta diminished, however, resistance units were forced
to rely more and more on the Muong people who made up the majority
in the lower Da valley. There being no particular policy for altering the
traditional Muong attitude of suspicion toward the Vietnamese to a new
spirit of alliance, it is not surprising that French commanders were able
to exploit the situation. By the middle of 1892 the prime remaining
leader, Doc Ngu, was substantially isolated. In August 1893 his assassination
was accomplished by Muong mercenaries.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a>

Unti11894, much to the anger of the French, it was still relatively easy
to cross and recross the Sino/Vietnamese frontier. From China Ton That
Thuyet still managed to harass the French in Cao-Bang, while Vietnamese
and Chinese partisans attacked the coal mines and outposts along the
coast and inland to the Luc-Nam River. With the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese
War, however, Peking gave strict instructions to her mandarins
along the southern frontier to avoid irritating the French at any cost. Resistance 
units retreating into China were not allowed to return, and Ton
That Thuyet was ordered to shift his residence to the vicinity of Canton.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a>
By the time Governor General Paul Doumer arrived in Indochina in
February 1897, the Can Vuong movement was a thing of the past. His
massive administrative and financial reforms would coincide with the
emergence of a new generation of anticolonial leaders.

</p>

<p>

Taken collectively, what was significant about the Can Vuong? From
our vantage point eighty years later, it obviously was doomed to failure,
if success is taken to mean ejection of the French and the revival of a
strong monarchist ethic amidst modernizing conditions. The Can Vuong
movement was never national in scope, even among the scholar-gentry
class alone. It was a mass movement only at times and in rather restricted
locations. Elitist leaders mobilized the local peasantry more for common
soldiering and logistical backup than for the provision of comprehensive
intelligence on the enemy or impressive political response and support.
There was no thought of generating anything that could be labeled revolutionary.
In short, this apparent minority of the scholar-gentry acted as
their idealistic ethic instructed, and some peasants loyally followed, as
they had in resistance against the Chinese in previous centuries. But the
French were not the Chinese. Since the Can Vuong leaders were not irrational
mystics, most of them, after the first barrages from modern French
cannon and rifles, appreciated that the balance of forces was completely
against them.

</p>

<p>

Yet they did fight on to eventual death or capture. In the material sense
their struggle was rather foolish. And certainly very few Frenchmen ever
quite understood what it was all about, to their ultimate misfortune. The
Can Vuong movement provided crucial moral and spiritual continuity
to the long struggle against this new foreign invader. Many of the more
sensitive Can Vuong leaders, acutely aware that they almost surely would
die violent deaths long before their country was liberated, paid self-conscious
attention to their personal images as patriots in the eyes of the
people&#8212;including the yet unborn. The patriotic poems, anecdotes, and
narratives that spread during their resistance and after their deaths were
in many ways historical reality in themselves, quite apart from their objective
truth or falsity. The impact of poetry in particular was more real
than anything conveyed by this page. And as we shall see, the next generation
came to maturity amidst this turmoil. Whether later they were
sympathetic to or skeptical of Can Vuong efforts, the positions they
argued and the actions they took were in large part conditioned by the
tactical failures and the spiritual successes of their predecessors.
