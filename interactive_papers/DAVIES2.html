			case 105: $("div#commentary").html('<b>ACTION FRANÇAISE (1899–1944),</b> nationalist and royalist movement of the extreme Right, influential in shaping the early phase of Vichy’s National Revolution. Led by Charles Maurras and spearheaded by its daily newspaper, <i>L’Action Française</i>, the movement became the avant-garde of the French nationalist Right in the decade before 1914. Mixing violent polemics and street brawling with serious political and literary commentary, the Action Française’s influence peaked in the years just after World War I, when its brand of nationalism was widely shared. Between the mid-1920s and the eve of World War II, the movement suffered a long, but gradual, period of decline hastened, first, by the Vatican’s condemnation in 1926, resulting in loss of Catholic support, and, second, by the steady defection of younger and more activist recruits to the radical leagues of the 1930s. However, the long-term impact of Maurrasian ideas proved to be significant, not only among the many “dissidents” who populated the more radical leagues of the 1930s but also across the spectrum of the nationalist Right. <br><br>Though the Action Française had been, from its earliest days, vehemently anti-German, by the late 1930s, it had become a leading force in the neopacifist campaign, culminating with its support of the Munich agreement. This paradox can be explained in terms of the alignment of ideological forces, both inside and outside France. Though Maurras had little sympathy for Nazism—which he saw as a variety of despised “Germanism”—he had even less sympathy for those who, he claimed, would benefit from a war against Hitler: the Soviet Union, French communists and their Popular Front allies, and Jews. Although the Action Française opposed the dreaded “ideological” war to the last day, when it was finally declared, the royalists supported its prosecution. The defeat of 1940, which brought in its wake the dismantling of the parliamentary Republic and the installation of Philippe Pétain as head of an authoritarian regime, seemed, at first, to open a new and promising phase in the movement’s history. Though the impact of the Action Française on Vichy’s National Revolution has sometimes been exaggerated, it was real, specifically because of the number of well-placed Maurrasians close to Pétain and, more generally, because Maurrasian ideas had had a shaping influence on the Catholic and reactionary Right through the years of the Third Republic. The laws, institutions, and moral tone of the Vichy government reflected long-standing royalist preferences: from the anti-Semitic laws to the emphasis on the ideals of order, hierarchy, corporation, and authority. Even though the royalist daily, published in Lyons, often criticized the slow pace of the National Revolution and its lax enforcement, it stood unwaveringly behind the figure of Pétain. This benefited the royalists early on, when Pétain’s popularity was almost universal; however, as his National Revolution proved increasingly hollow, and his decision to collaborate with the Nazi occupier increasingly disastrous, the Action Française, supporting its surrogate prince to the end, shared in the increasing disfavor directed against his government. Further, the Action Française’s habitually vicious attacks on selected groups and individuals—now focused on communists, Gaullists, and Jews—became, in some cases, tantamount to death sentences as officials, both German and French, hunted down their prey. Hence, when the Vichy regime went down in the flames of the Nazi defeat, the Action Française shared its fate. <br><br>*F.

	<p><b>[PAGE 19]</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Vichy and collaboration</p><p>From the National Revolution to Hitler’s revolution</b></p><p><blockquote>The new order cannot be a servile imitation of foreign experiments — though some of these experiments are not without sense and beauty. Each people, however, must conceive of a regime suitable to its temper and genius. A new order is an absolute necessity for France. Our tragedy is that we shall have to carry out in defeat the revolution which we were not even able to realise in victory, in peace, in an atmosphere of understanding among equal nations.<br><br>Marshal Pétain<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a></blockquote></p><p>Vichy is a tranquil, pleasant and unsuspecting town. In geographical terms it is almost the exact centre of France. It is famous for its spa water and its genteel way of life, and in the mid–1990s it was being marketed under the soundbite ‘<i>La Ville est une fête</i>’ — a totally ironic slogan given the wartime history of the place.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> In 1940 the small provincial town was the administrative HQ of the pro-German regime headed by France’s most decorated soldier, Marshal Philippe Pétain.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> It had been chosen for its convenient geographical location, excellent communications and ample hotel space. It was, if you like, the French equivalent of Cheltenham, Harrogate or Tunbridge Wells. However, a visitor to the town in the early twenty-first century would have to dig long and hard before unearthing any reference to Vichy’s notoriety in the 1940s. The fact is that today the town is quietly embarrassed about its wartime infamy.</p><p>The reality of the situation is that between 1940 and 1944, the humble and picturesque town of Vichy was home to conservatives, traditionalists, anti-semites, and even the odd heart-and-soul fascist. It was the idyllic background against which Pétain and his righthand man, Pierre Laval, attempted to govern the southern, unoccupied zone and negotiated with Hitler. When full executive power passed to the aged Marshal on 16 June 1940, he came to be regarded by some as a God-like saviour figure. The writer Paul Claudel was one of the first people to be seduced by the aura of the man: Marshal, this poem is about someone coming back to life. It is no small thing, coming back from the dead!…Marshal, here is that France in your arms, who has only you and who is coming slowly back to life, slowly and with a low voice…Marshal, the dead have a duty and that is to return to the living…Lift up your eyes and see something great and tricoloured in the heavens! Something in the heavens for ever, which cannot but prevail. Something which is, of itself, stronger than the darkness — the dawn!<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a></p><p>So, there was Claudel-like sycophancy; there was also a genuine and most sincere belief that Pétain <i>was</i> God:</p><p><blockquote>Our Father,<br>Who art our leader,<br>Hallowed be thy name.<br>Thy kingdom come.<br>Thy will be done<br>On earth, so we may live.<br>Give us each day our daily bread.<br>Give France back her life.<br>Let us not fall back into vain dreams and falsehoods.<br>But deliver us from evil,<br>O Marshal!<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a></blockquote></p><p>In time, for some, this image was to consolidate itself; for others it evaporated, and Pétain quickly came to be viewed as a sad and pathetic fool, incapable of governing and totally in the hands of the cold and calculating Laval. Here it is important to note, as Milza and Sirinelli do, that Vichy was not a bloc (as its opponents often claimed) but a ‘tower of Babel’, ‘diverse’ and ‘pluralistic’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> There was a range of ideas and influences at play at Vichy, and anyone wishing to explore and understand the regime has to take this fact on board. It would be more accurate to say that there was, as Birnbaum argues, a ‘Vichy of Pétain’ and a ‘Vichy of Laval’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Nevertheless, a cult rapidly established itself around the Marshal — an idolatry that was enhanced to an astonishing degree by the swathes of propaganda that began to emanate from the apex of the regime. By August 1944, Pétain had been captured by the Germans, and following the Liberation was to be imprisoned for life on the Île d’Yeu, an obscure and isolated island off the west coast of France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Atkin neatly summarises the life and career of Pétain in the headings he chooses for his book chapters: namely, The officer, 1856–1914’, The general, 1914–18’, The marshal, 1919– 39’, The saviour, 1939–40’, ‘Le chef, 1940–2’, The collaborator, 1940–2’, The figurehead, 1942–3’, The exile, 1944…’ and The man and the myth’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> As these titles indicate, Pétain had an extraordinary persona. In 1940 he was, at the same time, France’s most famous living soldier <i>and</i> the man who had led his country into collaboration with Nazi Germany.</p><p>This chapter will consider the general political climate at Vichy and the main contours of government; it will then move on to assess the two ultra-controversial <i>Pétainiste</i> initiatives of 1940 — the National Revolution and collaboration; and finally it will offer a series of perspectives on the question of how we should interpret the Vichy era as a whole.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> A number of key historical debates will underpin the chapter: How did the Vichy regime operate and how should it best be understood and characterised? What was the inspiration behind the National Revolution? What factors explain the policy of collaboration? To what extent was France guilty of assisting Nazi Germany in the <b>[PAGE 21]</b> Holocaust? What was the relationship and interplay between Pétain and Laval, and also between the National Revolution and collaboration? What was the reaction of France and French people to the Vichy regime and Pétain?</p><p>On 16 June 1940 Paul Reynaud resigned as premier and was succeeded by Pétain. Six days later, the Marshal signed the Armistice with Germany and on 10 July the National Assembly voted full powers to Pétain. The Third Republic had, in effect, voted itself out of existence. The Armistice allowed for an ‘independent’ French government in the southern zone and in time this new authority came to be known by a variety of pseudonyms, chief among which were ‘the Vichy regime’, ‘<i>l’État français</i>’ and the ‘Vichy administration’. When these terms are used, historians are talking about the same political entity. And, in essence, what we have to understand is that the Vichy regime was sweet revenge for all those conservative and right-wing forces excluded from the Third Republic in its later years<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> — a vehement riposte to the previous regime.</p><p>The pace of life at Vichy was slow, relaxed and leisurely — a far cry from the trauma, emotion and devastation of world war. It was as if Vichy was insulated from the rest of France and the rest of the world. Things continued as if nothing untoward had happened: a pleasant setting for, arguably, an overtly unpleasant regime. From the onset, Vichy had all the characteristics of a simple, paternalistic monarchy. Following the ‘suicide’ of the parliament-dominated Third Republic, Pétain saw no need to return to representative government and acted, to all intents and purposes, like an <i>ancien regime</i> sovereign. Goubert, for one, emphasises the fact that the Vichy regime meant the end of the Republic and the end too for parliament and democratic elections.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> There were ministers and departments — a façade of democratic government — but the fundamental reality was that Vichy was hierarchical, old fashioned and anti-democratic.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> Pétain did nothing to dispel this notion and actually encouraged it. He began all his official communications: ‘We, Philippe Pétain…’</p><p>The key relationship was that between Vichy and Berlin. At times it was Laval (or whoever else was filling the role of first minister), rather than Pétain, who pulled the diplomatic strings. There is much debate as to the exact nature of the Pétain-Laval relationship; suffice it to say that, in certain periods, Laval was given much room in which to negotiate and barter on behalf of the regime. The view that Pétain was an old man who was quite happy to hand over full power to Laval is clearly too simplistic; the reality was that Pétain involved himself in the things that he wanted to involve himself in, and knew what he wanted to know; and handed power over to Laval on that basis.</p><p><b>The National Revolution</b></p><p>The key development in the early years of Vichy was the National Revolution. It was Pétain’s personal policy agenda: a credo, a slogan, a glorified political statement. In essence it was all about the ‘hope of regeneration’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> Griffin might call the Vichy regime ‘para-fascist’,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> but the National Revolution was, over and above everything else, conservative in nature; and framed, primarily, as a retort to what the Marshal and his confidants perceived to be the innate corruption and weakness of the Third Republic. Here the intellectual importance of Maurras is central: Griffiths, Rémond and Larkin all <b>[PAGE 22]</b> agree that the traditionalist ideas of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">Action Française</a> were of profound significance in the development of <i>Pétainiste</i> thought.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> There is an excellent moment in the 1993 film, <i>Pétain</i>, when on a very tranquil summer day, soon after France’s military defeat, the Marshal and Laval are sitting by the river in Vichy talking about their future plans; Pétain says rather casually that the new regime needs a simple philosophy…and within seconds floats the idea of ‘<i>travail, famille, patrie</i>’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> Pétain viewed 1940 as a political, rather than a military, defeat; and as such argued that an overtly political response to the collapse of 1940 was required. The National Revolution was thus designed, and viewed, as the perfect antidote to the Third Republic: real values replacing undiluted decadence. For the historian of the National Revolution there is a plethora of key debates. Who and what were the main influences on Pétain and his conservative philosophy? What were the prime elements of the ‘revolution’ envisaged by the Marshal? How, and to what extent, was it influenced by Nazism? Was it in essence a ‘revolution’ or something very different — a ‘renovation’ or ‘restoration’ perhaps? How did ordinary French people react to the initiative? And, finally, was it home-grown or imported? There is also a more fundamental question: was the National Revolution, in reality, a political project formulated on the spur of the moment as a response to the crisis and catastrophe of 1940? Or was it, rather, a longstanding <i>Pétainiste</i> scheme — a product in effect of the Marshal’s own right-wing political agenda — that was instituted cleverly and opportunistically amid the ruin of defeat? This is an important question, for if Pétain’s crusade is shown to be planned, and thought out meticulously over decades of political plotting, it must be viewed as a highly ideological development. This in turn would affect our understanding of the whole rationale behind the project and its relationship, or non-relationship, with Nazi ideology.</p><p>The National Revolution emerges, in general terms, as an exercise in nostalgia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> This is exactly how Pétain envisaged it. His ancient mind was drawn naturally towards France’s ‘glorious past’ and, in a sense, it was predictable that his blueprint for a defeated and crisis-ridden France would mean going ‘backwards’ rather than ‘forwards’. It was also entirely in keeping with the new leader’s mindset that all the main influences on him, and his project, should emerge from France’s past, rather than its present: Barrès, Maurras and Péguy were three of these. As Anderson has stated: ‘The principles, the attitudes and the rancours of the National Revolution were deeply embedded in the French Right.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a></p><p>In an era of German occupation, German tutelage and German exploitation, there was in fact something peculiarly French about the National Revolution. In other spheres of policy Pétain may have merited being branded a ‘traitor’ but in, and through, the National Revolution he appeared to make a conscious attempt to return France to her authentic roots: a kind of nostalgic patriotism. This meant that the Vichy regime distinguished overtly between ‘French’ and ‘non-French’ elements; hence the <i>Pétainiste</i> belief in ‘anti- France’ — a make-believe coalition of ‘threatening’ forces (Jews, socialists, foreigners, protestants, freemasons <i>et al</i>.).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> Some will say that the National Revolution was nothing more than ‘imported Nazism’ but this is to miss the point. There were Nazi traits and influences at work in Pétain’s project — how could there not be? — but it is to underestimate the will of the Marshal, and the whole rationale of the ‘revolution’, to describe it as imported <i>anything</i>. Rather, it was a cocktail of Frenchness and indigenous <b>[PAGE 23]</b> tradition — a project all about ‘<i>la vieille France</i>’, as Werth puts it<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a></p><p>The National Revolution was also an innately ‘French’ scheme in the sense that it was the project of those people in the Vichy administration who stood furthest away from the Germans and who wanted to lift the spirits of France by returning to the essence of French society and French history. So, the hiatus of defeat and collapse offered an ideal opportunity for change and reform. In October 1940 Pétain out-lined his thinking: On this mound of ruins we must now reconstruct France. The new order must not in any sense imply a return, even disguised, to the mistakes that have cost us so much; nor should we look for signs of a sort of ‘moral order’, or revenge for the events of 1936. The new order must not be a slavish imitation of other people’s experiments. Some of these experiments are not without meaning or beauty. But every people should conceive a regime adapted to its climate and its national spirit. The new order is a necessity for France. We must bring about in defeat, tragically, the revolution that in victory, in peace, in voluntary alliance of equal peoples, we were unable to achieve.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a></p><p>Here it is important to note that Laval, the Paris Nazis <i>and</i> the German occupiers had little time for the National Revolution. These people viewed it as a parochial and rather strange initiative. While Laval viewed it ‘with contempt’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> — his admiration for Nazism and semi-nostalgia for the Third Republic were always too powerful<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> — the Nazis in Paris ridiculed it as symptomatic of a ‘soft’ administration, and the Germans displayed both ignorance of, and suspicion towards, it. As Anderson notes, Vichy’s authoritarian and retrospective outlook had very little in common with the revolutionary totalitarianism of the Nazis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a></p><p>Although historians constantly use the phrase National <i>Revolution</i>, Pétain tended to prefer the term National <i>Restoration</i>. This indicates the real nature of the initiative; as Sirinelli remarks, the ‘reactionary’ side of the National Revolution was always extremely visible.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> What Pétain was aiming at was not a ‘revolution’ in the strict sense of the word — a radical and progressive change — but a return to old values and norms. The different strands in Pétain’s thinking are reflected in a passage from his speech of 11 October 1940:</p><p>We must reconstruct. I want to achieve this reconstruction with your support. The Constitution will be the legal expression of a Revolution already begun in fact, for institutions are of value only through the spirit which they embody. A Revolution cannot be made only through laws and decrees. It can be successful only if the nation understands it, and asks for it, if the people accompany the Government along the path of essential renewal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a></p><p>In a counter-revolutionary vein that was both fundamental and explicit, Vichy attempted to overturn the heritage of 1789 in one fell swoop. Political democracy was blamed for everything; as Rémond declares, 1940 was the revenge of all the forces that had never accepted the Revolution.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> In trying to do this, it was bound to come across as naïve and cack-handed. In terms of ideas and symbols, it was simple enough to substitute the revolutionary slogan of ‘<i>liberté, egalite et fraternité</i>’ with the new (but old) triptych of <b>[PAGE 24]</b> ‘<i>travail, famille, patrie</i>’; however, in the arena of practical policies it was less sensible to think that a hastily thought-out policy agenda could return France, at a stroke, to an idyllic and over-glorified past. For this reason, Wright labels the Vichy triptych as ‘more slogan than reality’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> It was also difficult to rationalise and comprehend the Vichy war cry, ‘conservative revolution’ — a feeling that is enhanced when one realises that there were ever-present tensions between conservatives and modernisers within the corridors of power. However, in a range of spheres, Vichy leaders genuinely believed that they could turn back time: a solidly-built France, constructed on the pillars of age-old values, <i>could</i> take the place of a nation erected upon the follies of republicanism and 1789.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> The underlying message was clear: simple rules and concrete realities should, and would, replace abstract values. In short, this meant that ‘common sense’ was in, and the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man were out.</p><p>On economic matters — in the early days at least — Vichy was ultra-conservative. Pétain’s conviction was that France would always be ‘an essentially agricultural country’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> he and his associates on the right were convinced that France could be rejuvenated by what was called a’return to the land’. In this spirit, it was inevitable that peasants and peasantism, and the innate strength associated with these two terms, should be idolised by the administration.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> Likewise, the regime glorified ‘soil’ and ‘roots’, ancient crafts and rural trades, and as if to emphasise its self-identification with the ancient agricultural past, it chose the <i>francisque</i> as its primary emblem and letterhead logo.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> Although in many ways this part of Vichy doctrine overlapped with parts of Nazi ideology, it is fairly clear that ‘peasantism’ was a creed conceived in France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a></p><p>In this spirit, Vichy offered special aid packages to small family farms. In the end only ‘about a 1,000’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> people responded to the government’s ‘return to the land’ policy and took advantage of the financial incentives that were offered under the scheme. For the most part, the idea of a renewed, rural nation, administered by a special peasant corporation,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> had to remain an unfulfilled goal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> The idolisation of agrarian France was, however, just one element of the regime’s organised nostalgia. Village life was also admired, as was the age-old role of the Catholic Church in small communities. One Vichy poster tried to bring life to this all-round vision. It featured a picture of a typical French village — complete with neatly-mown fields and church. The caption read: ‘PATRIE SUIVEZ MOI! GARDEZ VOTRE CONFIANCE EN LA FRANCE ÉTERNELLE’.</p><p>Vichy was a regime of contrasts. Rural nostalgia sat side by side with a powerful belief in corporatism. Here perhaps there <i>was</i> a genuinely fascist idea, with all economic activity to be monitored by state corporations. In many ways this idea was sold as a ‘third way’ between capitalism and socialism.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> Twenty-nine professional ‘families’ were put in charge of the French economy — one for each industry. A labour charter was also introduced in March 1941. The overall aim, so the Vichy authorities announced, was ‘social peace’; or as Griffiths puts it, the prevention of ‘class war’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> The underlying assertion was that individualism and the class struggle were unhealthy and antiquated concepts; it was argued that what the ‘new’ France needed more than anything was harmony and reconciliation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> The reality though was different. As McMillan argues, corporatism revealed Vichy’s desire to smash the unions and the working class, and as Milza and Werth also conclude, Vichy was essentially capitalist whatever the corporatist <b>[PAGE 25] </b> window-dressing and propaganda might suggest.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a></p><p>Initially, therefore, there was a myriad of influences at Vichy — ‘reactionary, monarchist, corporatist, clerical’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> — but in the end it was the ‘modernists’ who took sway and the government, whatever Pétain’s personal prejudices, began to embrace state planning and technology (the inception of a 10-year plan being a prime example of this policy in action). This development was also a consequence of increased German control in the southern zone and the after-effects of the 1942 invasion. Thereafter, the Germans dominated and Vichy economic thinking had no choice but to adapt itself to the prevailing wind. (Larkin claims that, in 1943, 15 per cent of France’s agricultural produce, 40 per cent of her industrial output and 85 per cent of her vehicle production went straight into German hands.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> The influence of the ‘sharp young things’ reached a peak in the period between 1942 and 1944; and in the end, as Rémond notes, the legacy was a positive one for France, with the country’s post-war economic planners heavily in debt to the strategists of the late-Vichy period.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a></p><p>It could also be argued that there was a progressive dimension to Vichy rule in the realm of social affairs and welfare.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> For the most part, however, the regime’s attitude to issues like demography and reproduction has been interpreted as traditionalist and reactionary; Copley argues that ‘conservative France wished for a moral revolution’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> and Pétain was sure that the disaster of 1940 was inextricably linked to the falling French birth-rate — and the knock-on consequence of this for the military effort. More children, he argued, would mean more soldiers, and more soldiers, he surmised rather simplistically, would mean more military victories. This then, for Pétain, was the urgency of the situation and, for us, a graphic illustration of the Marshal’s way of thinking.</p><p>In power, Pétain prioritised the birth-rate issue and sent a clear message out to the effect that a woman’s place was in the home. His regime used both stick and carrot in trying to make this edict a reality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> Abortion and contraception were made illegal and all female employment was prohibited in October 1940. To encourage reproduction, family allowances were increased in April 1941, parents who had three or more children were granted special privileges (the mother would acquire a ‘priority card’; the father would be allowed to work overtime), and women who rejected offers of paid employment would be paid an average wage to stay at home. Predictably too, homosexuality and pederasty were also vilified.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> In the end, whatever the success of the policy — and that was debatable — the impression left was of a man and an administration eager to return to a society in which women were valued only for their fertility. This sentiment runs through much of Vichy’s propaganda. For instance, the government issued a special poster which stated: ‘1941 L’ANNÉE DU NETTOYAGE’. The meaning was clear: France had to rid herself of ‘unhealthy’ influences. However, the key image was of a blonde, bare-footed, cleaning woman tidying up. It was no coincidence that the female in the poster was presented in such a traditional role.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a></p><p>More generally, Pétain glorified the family. As an opening gambit he banned the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, arguing that ‘man’ and the ‘individual’ did not exist except in the abstract. In reality, he argued, it was communities like the family that existed and that deserved praise, attention and rights.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> He also established a government department — the General Secrétariat for Youth and the Family — to monitor developments and make policy in this area. Vichy’s social policy had a number of <b>[PAGE 26]</b> emphases but there was one overall aim: to strengthen the institution of the family. The regime tried to encourage ‘enlarged families’ — where adults would care for the very young and the very old. It also railed against divorce which in April 1941 was banned in the first three years of marriage. The reactionary nature of Vichy policy was illustrated by the fact that all divorce cases linked to adultery had to be referred to the police.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a></p><p>There were other planks to Vichy’s moral crusade. Youth and its virtues were glorified and the regime encouraged an array of almost fascist-style movements for teenagers and young people: the <i>Chantiers de Jeunesses</i> and the <i>Compagnons de France</i> to name but two.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> These groups attempted to imbue youngsters with the ‘right’ attitudes. However, as Milza points out, it is significant that Vichy never created one <i>single</i> youth movement — a sign for him that there was no real totalitarian project.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a> Nevertheless, the <i>idea</i> of youth was integral to Vichy — despite, or maybe because of, the fact that the regime was personified by an ageing leader. A key Vichy propaganda poster featuring the words, ‘FRANCE NOUVELLE’ incorporated the phrase ‘A NOUS JEUNES’. Significantly too, this poster incorporated the image of two blond, dynamic-looking faces.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a></p><p>The administration was eager to ‘clean up’ what it viewed as a decadent and corrupt education system and thus determined to help foster a more ‘patriotic’ climate in schools. The Vichy regime also made a strenuous effort to point out the dangers implicit in alcohol and over-indulgence (this of course harked back to one of the right’s initial post- 1940 observations: that the Fall of France was more about social indiscipline — alcoholism, for example — than about military failure pure and simple).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a></p><p>In all of its strictures on the family, morality and demography, Vichy knew that it was also tapping into Catholic and Christian teaching. In this sense, it anticipated that it would have a <i>de facto</i> ally in the Church. Rémond states that Vichy was ‘allied to the Church’ and ‘invoked its patronage’, while Larkin claims that the Church gained ‘various tokens of government favour’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a> Halls also explains how the Germans viewed Pétain’s National Revolution as essentially antisecular; they were, he claims, wary of its ‘clericalism’ and ‘antisecularity’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> For most of the time this was most certainly the case. However, as Atkin and Tallett warn us, the Church never spoke with one single voice; it was a mosaic rather than a monolithic bloc. And on some issues, like marital separation, it is clear that the Church did not always get its own way.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a> In the light of this, it would probably be sensible not to exaggerate the extent of the Church’s influence and the strength of the Vichy-Church ‘alliance’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a></p><p>Throughout its policy pronouncements and preaching on morality, there was one underlying theme: the belief that Vichy incarnated some higher kind of patriotism. In sinister propaganda posters individual people were challenged to emulate Pétain’s level of patriotic service — ‘<i>Êtes-vous plus Français que lui? </i>’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> Throughout the Marshal’s time as puppet leader of the unoccupied zone, he talked in a passionate way about ‘France’. This was done more in spiritual than in territorial terms (as in truth Pétain had to, given the provision in the Armistice which split the nation into ‘French’ and ‘non-French’ zones). The Marshal claimed that, in becoming leader of France in the summer of 1940, he had ‘sacrificed himself’ to the nation in some kind of profound, ultra-noble gesture. He also believed, less than modestly, that he alone personified all the main French virtues.<b>[PAGE 27]</b></p><p>Although in one sense Pétain’s patriotic credentials <i>were</i> unquestionable — the ‘Victor of Verdun’ was France’s greatest living soldier — in another, perhaps more important way, it was difficult to comprehend how a man who had agreed to collaborate with Hitler could continue to play the ‘patriotic’ card. The fact of the matter was that France was divided — not just in a geographical sense (occupied zone/unoccupied zone) but also in social, political and economic terms. In this situation, how <i>could</i> Pétain have the arrogance to claim to be patriotic, especially when he was collaborating with and, in some respects, aping fascist ideas? In the end, after the Liberation of France, Pétain was sentenced to death for his treasonous activities during the period of the Occupation, even though he continued to believe that through the National Revolution and other initiatives, he was piloting France back to her essential roots and eternal values.</p><p>On the whole, it is difficult to gauge the popularity of the National Revolution with ordinary people living in the southern zone. Perhaps the best that can be said is that it was tolerated. While there was respect for Pétain and his personal history, there was no genuine love — hence the need for massive, and often ridiculous, Vichyite propaganda campaigns to whip up support. There were other problems at the heart of the Marshal’s master plan. The speed with which the National Revolution was launched hinted at one of two things: either that it was the natural outcome of Pétain’s increasing political involvement in the 1930s — he was a behind-the-scenes plotter in the political crisis of February 1934–or that it was a spontaneous, and perhaps hasty, response to catastrophe. Lee argues in fact that the only chance ‘fascism’ had of imposing itself in France was through war and collapse.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> The National Revolution was never a product of the popular will; rather, just the personal agenda of an aged and perhaps bitter old man — and also, significantly, of a man who never had the political instincts of a Laval. This meant that Pétain was invariably viewed as out of touch, and his political ideas suffered naturally as a result.</p><p>There were also the inevitable tensions: on the level of ideas between traditionalists and modernists, on the level of personalities between Pétain and Laval, and on the level of governance between Berlin and Vichy. These frictions often boiled over into confrontations, with negative consequences for practical policy-making. Nonetheless, one is left with the feeling that Pétain did not really care greatly about the practical success of the National Revolution; perhaps all he really wanted to do was to make a statement of belief and to rubbish the hated Republic. With no real time to make its mark, the National Revolution did not leave a massive imprint on French society. Apart from the legacy in terms of state planning — which the Fourth Republic eagerly built upon — there was very little bequeathed to France, except the memory of a rather sad and anachronistic valuesystem.</p><p><b>Collaboration</b></p><p>If the National Revolution was, in essence, about France returning to its roots and rediscovering its Frenchness, collaboration was, in fundamental terms, about the Vichy regime and ordinary French people kowtowing to a foreign power. If one term has emerged from the wartime period with a horrible, unpleasant stigma attached to it, it is <b>[PAGE 28]</b> this one. Collaboration, though, is not the most straightforward word to define, nor the easiest phenomenon to identify. It is very much an umbrella term and, as such, it is essential to think of it in the plural. At its narrowest collaboration can be defined as a ‘working relationship’ at governmental level between victor and vanquished; and at its broadest, as any sign — or even hint — of contact between occupier and occupied. Similarly, the way in which collaboration has been perceived varies widely; in the case of the arch-conspirators at governmental level, or on an ideological plane, it has been viewed as the most heinous of crimes — to be punished with death — while in the context of ordinary people going about their everyday lives, it has been interpreted as an almost inevitable consequence of the Occupation.</p><p>Collaboration came in many forms: liaisons in the black market, personal friendships and, most notorious of all, ‘<i>collaboration horizontale</i>’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> As Price remarks, it could take the form of calculated behaviour or just accidental relationships.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> At its most overt — Defrasne argues that it reached its ‘summit’ between June 1941 and December 1942<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a> — collaboration meant partnership at a governmental level between the Vichy administration and Hitler (or put more accurately, the subservience of France to Germany).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> The logistics of collaboration were mentioned initially in the Armistice of 22 June 1940, and confirmed via the historic Pétain-Hitler handshake at Montoire on 24 October 1940.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> This handshake was a potent symbol, but thereafter, it was Laval and Hitler’s ambassador in France, Otto Abetz, who played the pivotal roles in Franco- German relations. It was the former who, with the tacit approval of Pétain, masterminded one of the most controversial of Vichy’s policy initiatives, the STO, and on a level even more gruesome, the deportation of Jews to Germany.</p><p>While it is interesting to debate the ethics and morality of collaboration, it is probably more important to assess how and why it actually took place. Defrasne helps us in this respect. He says that at root collaboration was the product of ‘passion’ (sympathy and admiration for Nazi Germany), ‘acceptance’ (the notion that some type of ‘partnership’ was unavoidable given the events of 1940) and ‘self-interest’ (the ambition of many French politicians and officials).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> Each of these themes is important in trying to understand the essence of collaboration.</p><p>At its most stark, collaboration was a desperate and unavoidable reaction to defeat and collapse in 1940. There was, it could be argued, no real alternative. That said, there were other factors at play. In this, Pétain’s behaviour was central. In agreeing to collaborate, the Marshal believed that he was ‘giving’ himself to protect France from further Nazi savagery — the ‘shield’ that would work in tandem with de Gaulle’s ‘sword’ (as he was happy to reiterate so frequently). In this sense Pétain was pursuing a strategy of damagelimitation.</p><p>Laval’s attitude was different, and on the surface far less ‘principled’. As an ultrapragmatic politician (Pétain, of course, was first and foremost a military man), he had deduced that the war was a confronta tion between fascism and communism and that everyone, including himself, had to make a choice. He opted for Hitler. Collaboration suited his pacifistic outlook and also gave him the chance to jockey for position in a post- Pétain, Hitler-controlled ‘new Europe’. Laval’s surrender to Nazi Germany was accompanied by a blossoming personal friendship with Abetz, and a growing interest in supporting the German war effort (for example, he offered 200 pilots to Hitler for his air <b>[PAGE 29]</b> battle with Britain).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a></p><p>Beyond the issue of personalities, there was a longstanding belief in France — evident especially in the 1930s — that an alliance with the diplomatic powers of central Europe was an inevitable, and also desirable, arrangement.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> Laval, when French foreign minister in the mid–1930s, had been keen to explore the possibility of Franco-Italian and Franco- German understandings. The contours of diplomacy in the second half of 1940 should, therefore, come as no huge surprise.</p><p>On the French side, there were other factors encouraging the search for an accommodation with Germany: the desire, or need, to impress the Germans in an effort to water down the main terms of the Armistice and the genuine belief that the Vichy regime and Hitler stood for similar values — the notion, in effect, that collaboration was an ideological understanding. Collaboration can also be interpreted in foreign policy terms. For a start, the British bombardment of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 had totally alienated the Vichy leadership and the regime’s enthusiasm for collaboration could thus be viewed, quite plausibly, as a determined effort to snub the British and tap into French Anglophobia. Furthermore it was true that Vichy’s help would be useful for the Germans’ war effort, whether in central Africa, North Africa or Europe itself. One should not exaggerate Hitler’s enthusiasm for collaboration. He didn’t want a partner, but he did need a servant. Overall it would be wise not to stray too far from Paxton’s conclusion; namely, that collaboration was a French proposal, not a German demand.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> If the National Revolution was predominantly the project of Pétain, collaboration was — with the acquiescence of the Marshal — the issue on which Laval acquired his main notoriety. In one sense this is ironic, because Laval was not involved in the signing of the Armistice (which first mentioned collaboration), and because for much of the wartime period he was either out of power or, when in power, viewed by the Nazis as a <i>hindrance</i> to an effective working relationship between the two countries (or so he seems to claim in his unpublished diary.)<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> Nevertheless, Laval has given observers — at the time and since — plenty of ammunition with which to blacken his name. The first lines of his diary, written while in prison at Fresnes, reflect this fact:</p><p>Mr. President, During my hearing yesterday you handed me the Act of Accusation filed on 13 June 1945, during my absence from France. I wish to thank you for this communication. It has enabled me to know the charges brought against me. They consist in two accusations: first, to have threatened the internal security of the State; second, to have had relations with the enemy in time of war. I hasten to set forth in writing my immediate reactions to this document.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a></p><p>Laval’s ‘political’ co-operation with Nazi Germany may have been the most scrutinised form of Franco-German collaboration but there were, however, other significant ‘types’. In the economic sphere collaboration was all-pervading: from grand Laval initiatives like the STO — which involved thousands of French workers being ‘loaned’ to Germany — to small individual black market deals involving the French and the German occupiers, and other unscrupulous arrangements in between these two extremes. At one point during the war almost half of France’s economic resources were being earmarked for the German <b>[PAGE 30]</b> war effort — significant evidence of the level and scope of economic collaboration.</p><p>On a social level, collaboration was unavoidable. In the northern zone, one <i>had</i> to comply with German dictates and follow German-devised rules — otherwise there would be trouble. It was also very difficult <i>not</i> to communicate with representatives of the occupying force and <i>not</i> to patronise commercial establishments either owned or frequented by German officials. In this sense it is problematic to differentiate between what is now labelled ‘passive’ and ‘active’ collaboration. Simone de Beauvoir is one high-profile figure to fall foul of post-war commentators; her visits to German-patronised cafés have been interpreted by some as tantamount to collaboration.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a></p><p><b>Vichy and the Jews</b></p><p>The most notorious aspect of the wartime period was Vichy’s attitude, and policy, towards the Jews. As Adler states: ‘The anti-Jewish laws established in France in October 1940 marked the beginning of the application by the Germans and Vichy of an anti- Jewish policy that was still in the process of elaboration.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> Even though Cobban has argued that France’s anti-semitic legislation lagged far behind Hitler’s, another commentator, Webster, has described Pétain’s policy as akin to ‘an inhumane crusade.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> Whatever the verdict, it is clear that the Vichy regime was, to a greater or lesser extent, an agent in Hitler’s Final Solution, and that is the ignominy which the regime, and its personnel, have had to live with since.</p><p>Institutional anti-semitism in France during the wartime period was a mix of Vichy laws and German ordinances (for good measure the occupiers monitored and examined all ‘French’ legislation).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> The antisemitism of Vichy can be viewed from a number of angles. Two can be considered here. First, under the Armistice agreement, Pétain’s administration undertook to repatriate all German Jews who had fled to France as refugees in the 1930s — a task that Laval, in particular, carried out ruthlessly in an effort to guarantee that Hitler would actually spare indigenous ‘French’ Jews. Second, the whole Vichy crusade can be viewed as another sad episode in the long history of French anti-semitism, and also as a graphic reminder of the regime’s belief in the existence of a threatening coalition of ‘anti-France’ forces.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> Here it is easy — and perhaps, for some, convenient — to add Vichy to the genealogy of right-wing French racism which starts with Drumont and also incorporates Barrès, the anti-Dreyfusards, Maurras, the Action Française and the <i>ligues</i>. It is useful to keep these two contrasting perspectives in mind as our discussion of Vichy anti-semitism proceeds.</p><p>It is vital to comprehend the scale of Vichy’s anti-semitic crusade. Zuccotti states that: ‘More than 24 per cent of the Jews in France perished in the Holocaust.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> Larkin declares that, overall, 70,000 Jews were deported from France during the wartime period, of which a third were French citizens, and of which only 2,500 survived. Xavier Vallat, Vichy’s Commissioner General for Jewish Affairs,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> claimed after the war that 95 per cent of French Jews survived the Occupation period; a figure, he asserted, that dwarfed the combined figure for the other occupied countries (5.8 per cent). One must not underestimate the scale of a crusade that, to Adler, amounted to the ‘politics of expropriation’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> The statutes enacted by Vichy were all-encompassing: they delineated, <b>[PAGE 31]</b> amongst other things, who was Jewish, who could qualify as a French citizen, and how many Jews could be employed in professional sectors such as medicine and law.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a></p><p>The debate which has preoccupied historians has been a simple and important one: What factors, in reality, explain Vichy’s anti-semitic policy? Underpinning this debate are other questions: Was Vichy’s antisemitism homegrown or imported? Was it voluntarily or involuntarily put forward? And finally, and fundamentally, how ‘guilty’ was Pétain and his regime when one assesses the Holocaust as a whole? Did the administration take part, knowingly, in the anti-Jewish offensive?</p><p>As regards Vichy’s involvement in the Holocaust, an obvious line of thinking is that which emphasises the indigenous nature of antisemitism in France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> ‘This argument is advanced by Wistrich, who talks about ‘an autonomous racist tradition’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a> Here it is almost assumed that the ideas of Drumont, Barrès and Maurras — among others — percolated through into the dogma and ideology of Vichy; the corollary of this is the view which says that the impact of Nazi anti-semitism on Pétain and Laval was minimal and had no definite influence on the regime’s policy-making. Historians who follow this line also point out that Vichy’s anti-semitic decrees were introduced very hastily in 1940 and 1941<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a>; thus, in no way could they be seen as aping Nazi laws. It is argued that Vichy’s early legislation actually <i>pre-dated</i> the worst of Hitler’s and, most definitely therefore, could not have been anything other than a policy made in France and of French parentage. Add to this the fact that several Vichy ministers were renowned for their racist views — Vallat, Louis Darquier de Pellepoix and Charles Mercier du Paty de Clam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> So Pétain may not have made great play of his own anti-semitic beliefs prior to 1940 — if he had them at all — but in power he was certainly surrounded by card-carrying racists.</p><p>Alternatively, it could be postulated that it was the Catholic tradition in France, rather than the lineage of anti-semitic ideas, that had a significant impact on Pétain. This claim is made by Price who explains Vichy anti-semitism as ‘catholic’ and ‘nationalistic’ rather than ‘racialist’ <i>per se</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> This perspective is tangential to the previous one in that the Catholic Church prior to 1940 was well known for its less than subtle anti-semitic outlook. And in the months immediately following the Fall of France and Pétain’s elevation to full executive power, it would be accurate to say that the Catholic Church gave Vichy’s racial laws its covert backing, if not its overt support. So, latent prejudice against the Jews, whether of a secular or religious nature, appears to be of obvious, and paramount, importance.</p><p>In a similar vein, it is crucial to acknowledge the influence of the Action Française on the Vichy leader. Maurras — the man who patented the idea of ‘anti-France’ and the notion of the Jews as one of the four main domestic ‘threats’ — was, throughout the Occupation period, one of the chief intellectual influences on Pétain. It is clear that Cobban agrees to some extent with this line of thinking. He points out that <i>L’Action française</i> was one of the few newspapers allowed to publish freely in the southern zone — as if intimating that Maurras and his movement, because of their ideological proximity to the regime, had special privileges granted upon them by Pétain.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a></p><p>It could be argued that Vichy’s anti-semitism was in some way aimed at ‘impressing’ Berlin. This is a theory put forward by Larkin and is based on Vichy’s desire for an improved working relationship with the Nazis; perhaps prompted by the desire for more leeway in policy-making.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> Here, it is noted that Vichy made a point of introducing the <b>[PAGE 32]</b> occasional policy aimed at external consumption; like, for example, the decree banning Jews from the <i>département</i> in which Vichy, the town, was located, or the piece of legislation which stated that all Jews in the unoccupied zone had to advertise themselves with a pinned-on yellow star. Were these ‘showcase’ policies which aped Nazi initiatives or were they designed to impress Berlin? Both lines of thinking certainly have their adherents.</p><p>These of course are all legitimate lines of argument; each perspective has its own merit and validity and each merges and overlaps with others. However, to form a complete picture, it is vital to explore three other major factors: the defeat of 1940 and its implications, the political machinations of Laval, and the demands of Berlin. McMillan makes the point that amid the catastrophe and national humiliation of 1940, it was a natural, if rather unpleasant, reflex for France — and in particular, the Vichy leadership — to search for a suitable scapegoat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a> As we have already noted, Pétain was quick to identify the politicians of the inter-war years as guilty of leading France into decline and demise. In time — and, significantly, without too much dilly-dallying — he extended this analysis to include the Jews. Price argues that this state-sponsored xenophobia was a predictable reaction to economic depression, political instability and defeat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a></p><p>It is difficult though to account for Vichy’s anti-semitic policy without acknowledging the pivotal role played by Laval. Again there is no reason to believe that Laval was a heart-and-soul anti-semite in the mould of someone like Vallat, say, but it is crucial to realise that Laval, for most of the wartime period, was the middleman in Berlin-Vichy and Vichy-Berlin communication, and thus played a major role in articulating the administration’s position on the Jews. And although he strenuously denied all accusations of wrongdoing, it is clear that Laval had his own personal agenda.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a> He was happy, for example, to barter with Hitler in the most unpleasant of terms — sacrificing foreign Jews in an effort to protect French Jews — and also to execute German-inspired policies with vigour and enthusiasm. One must realise that Laval was a career politician, with very few scruples, who viewed the Jews, first and foremost, as useful bargaining chips. A man of significant ambition — and a political operator who was probably thinking five or ten years ahead in all of his wartime calculations — t is also undisputable that Laval had his eye on a key leadership role in Hitler’s ‘new Europe’. In this sense, it could be argued that Laval used the Jewish question as a launching pad for his own ambitions — unaware of course that he had backed the wrong horse in Hitler and the Nazis.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a> Naturally too Berlin, and its wartime demands, had a substantial impact on Vichy policy. Whether it was the Armistice, and the exigencies inherent in this document, or the STO or, more generally, the Nazi regime’s ideological offensive, the Jews were always going to be a key target.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a></p><p><b>Collaborationism</b></p><p>The other highly distinctive form of collaboration was that which traded in ideas: collaborationism. Here we must turn our gaze towards the group of idealists, intellects and ‘<i>Germanophiles</i>’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a> who gathered in Paris to idolise and emulate the Nazi valuesystem. These people are variously known as ‘pro-Nazis’, ‘French fascists’, ‘pro-Germans’, <b>[PAGE 33]</b> ‘French Nazis’, ‘Paris collaborationists’ and ‘Nazi sympathisers’. For our purposes we will label them ‘the Paris Nazis’ — probably the best, most descriptive term. These cranky and off-beam individuals never constituted a sizeable force; nor did they ever have much serious influence, although a selection of them did enter the ‘French’ government in January 1944 when the Germans overran the southern zone.</p><p>What we are dealing with here is a group of hardcore collaborators — The Ideologists’:<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> people like Jacques Doriot, Marcel Déat, Robert Brasillach, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Alphonse de Châteaubriant, Lucien Rebatet, Fernand de Brinon, Jean Luchaire and Joseph Darnand. To a significant degree, they shared a common set of beliefs. They were overtly pro-Nazi and anticommunist and upheld the notion of ‘<i>la France allemande</i>’;<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a> they saw the Occupation as an opportunity for ‘national regeneration’ along fascist lines — and also for some kind of European solidarity under the aegis of Hitler’s Germany; and they exhibited a pathological hatred of Jews. Notwithstanding this ‘common agenda’, it would be fair to say that there were three distinct groups of ideological collaborators: the ‘fugitives from the French Left’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a> (ex-socialists like Doriot and Déat), the ‘literary traitors’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a> (fascist writers inspired by Nietzsche like Drieu la Rochelle and Céline) and the ‘opportunists’ (people like de Brinon, Luchaire and Darnand who were motivated by the possibilities of personal advancement).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a></p><p>The Parisian collaborationists had very little in common with Pétain and Pétainism. Although de Brinon and Darnand personified the link between Paris and Vichy — both held office under Pétain — the Nazis in the capital generally viewed Vichy as ‘soft conservatism’. Sirinelli identifies a definite ‘tension’ in the relationship.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100">[100]</a> The fact remains, however, that the French collaborationists formed a small and fairly insignificant group. But, in a country which has always placed great store on the power of ideas and intellects, these extremists were acknowledged as important players in the drama of the Occupation era — and were thus treated severely at the Liberation, as the case of Brasillach, in particular, demonstrates. Collaborationism was voluntary, wholehearted and fanatical:<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">[101]</a> this was its uniqueness when compared to other types of collaboration, which were fundamentally involuntary and <i>forced on</i> people.</p><p>The conclusion must be that collaboration — if defined in its broadest sense — was always going to be inevitable once France had collapsed and had been occupied. It could be argued that collaboration in the corridors of power was the most explicit form of Franco-German ‘union’, while collaboration in ideas was, possibly, the most demonised. The reality of the situation, also, was that ordinary people, in their everyday lives, would always come into contact with the occupiers — on an economic or social level — and would always, therefore, be accused of collaboration.</p><p>The defeat in 1940 had profound implications: on the one hand, the ultra-traditional crusade that was the National Revolution; on the other, the <i>realpolitik</i> of collaboration. Historians will forever debate the exact political orientation of Vichy but the truth, as Anderson notes, is that the National Revolution was ‘not a coherent unity’.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">[102]</a> Milza argues that the <i>Pétainiste</i> regime shared common ground with that of Salazar and that of Mussolini,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">[103]</a> but we must remember that the authentic fascists Vichy came into contact with — the Nazis in Berlin and the collaborationists in Paris — had nothing but scorn for the regime’s ‘soft’ ideology. In the end it is hard not to agree with Rémond’s assessment <b>[PAGE 34]</b> of Vichy: ‘It was a conservatism triumphant, reaction in its pure state, a mixture of paternalism, clericalism, moralism, militarism and boy scoutism…a tragic and ludicrous parody of fascism.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">[104]</a></p><p>Lest we forget, Vichy, for most of the wartime period, had little real independence. In the first two years it was, to all intents and purposes, a puppet regime, owing its very existence to one particular article in the Nazi-imposed Armistice. And in the last two years of the war, after the German invasion of the south, its sovereignty had been cut down to virtually nil. Perhaps the best way to interpret Vichy is as a rearguard action: a staunch effort, led by Pétain, to protect what he regarded as French. In this circle too was Laval — pragmatic, cynical and ambitious, and a man who wished to ingratiate himself with the Germans. By the end of 1945 both men had been sentenced: one to life imprisonment and the other to death.</p>
