He subsequently served as Minister of Education (1925), Minister of Justice (1936), and notably as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Popular Front governments of Léon Blum and Camille Chautemps.<br><br>In January 1937, unveiling a war memorial at Chateauroux, Delbos</b>, in reply to Hitler’s Reichstag speech of the previous day, emphasised the need for Franco-German understanding and for both countries to find new markets so that industrial expansion might replace rearmament. After representing France at the Nine-Power Conference at Brussels on November 3, he expounded French Foreign Policy in a debate in the Chamber on November 18–19, emphasizing Anglo-French friendship and the necessity for its maintenance. Ten days later, he visited London with Chautemps to receive a report from Neville Chamberlain and Anthony Eden on the result of the Halifax-Hitler talks. Afterwards, he set out on a tour of the central and eastern European capitols, visiting Warsaw on December 3, Bucharest on December 8, Belgrade on December 12, and Prague on December 15, in each case discussing the European situation with the ministers of the countries in question, and seeking to foster friendly relations with France.<br><br>On December 10, 1937, it was announced that a plot to assassinate him at Prague had been discovered by the French Police and the prospective assailant was arrested. He was reappointed Foreign Minister in the reconstructed Chautemps government in the third week of January 1938 but was excluded from Leon Blum’s cabinet in March 1938.<br><br>During the Spanish Civil War, he worked alongside his British counterpart Anthony Eden in fleshing out the policy of nonintervention.<br><br>From “Yvon Delbos,” <i>Wikipedia</i>.<br><br><b>MUNICH AGREEMENT (September–October 1938)</b> was the culmination of Anglo–French appeasement policy and permitted Nazi Germany to achieve, through military intimidation, the dismemberment and occupation (March 1939) of Czechoslovakia. Ostensibly, the Munich agreement focused on selfdetermination for the Sudeten Germans, but it really concerned European security and the German quest for hegemony. <br><br>Soviet, Czech, and Anglo–French diplomats recognized the German threat to Czechoslovakia, which the Franco–Soviet and Czech–Soviet mutual assistance pacts of 1935 were intended to counter. After the German remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, the French army lost its capability to attack in the west to relieve Czechoslovakia should it be attacked. In addition, the French High Command had no offensive plans against Nazi Germany. The French failure to react was symptomatic of a loss of confidence in their power. These divisions were exacerbated by the electoral victory of the Popular Front and the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. The French government became dependent on Britain, which did not want important continental commitments and did not have, nor wish to build up, an army to support them. <br><br>The German annexation of Austria in March 1938 made Czechoslovakia the next logical target and set in motion the process leading to the Munich crisis. At the same time the French and British governments determined that they could not defend Czechoslovakia and that the Czech government must make concessions. Poland, in theory a French ally but hostile to Czechoslovakia, refused support. All these factors led to heavy Anglo–French pressure on Czechoslovakia to yield to German demands. The USSR offered staff talks, but the French did not want them, and the Czechs would not fight with the Soviet Union as its only ally. At the same time Poland threatened war to seize the Teschen region. All these factors led to Anglo–French capitulation in spite of efforts by <i>bellicistes </i>to avert it. In May 1937 French foreign minister <b>Yvon Delbos</b> had observed that France could not abandon Czechoslovakia “without disappearing as a great power from the map of Europe.” <b>Delbos’</b> observation proved to be correct. <br><br>*J.-B.

The most prominent among them were former premier Édouard Daladier, former minister of foreign affairs <b>Yvon Delbos</b>, and former minister of the interior Georges Mandel. By the time the <i>Massilia </i>reached Morocco, things had changed in the metropole. An armistice with German had been signed and the government was enroute to Vichy. Casablanca and Algiers were forgotten. The 27 political refugees were now seen as an embarrassment, potential troublemakers beyond the reach of metropolitan authority. <br><br>Only Mandel, who was on record as a die-hard opponent of any accommodation with Germany, posed any real problem for the new regime in France. Most of the other passengers on the <i>Massilia </i>wanted nothing more than to return home as quickly as possible. Mandel, however, spoke with both French and British representatives in Morocco about setting up a Resistance government. Even a top-level mission from London (which included a cabinet minister) was sent to Rabat to try to make contact with him. It was prevented from doing so by French authorities in Morocco. <br><br>The French press of the day described the voyage of the <i>Massilia </i>as a flight from France by deserters and traitors. It was nothing of the sort. Above all, it was a patriotic mission that failed. <br><br>R. Champoux, “The Massilia Affair,” <I>JCH </I>10: 2 (April 1975): 283–300; J. M.

PARIS, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">January 5, 1940</a><br>
<br>
MINISTER OF EDUCATION<br>
to Messrs. the Academic Inspectors<br>
<br>
The Ministry of Armements is trying to resupply its factories, which absorb huge amounts of iron, at the lowest possible cost. The ore also requires, for the extraction of iron, large quantities of coke.<br>
<br>
In order to avoid massive purchases of coal and iron abroad we thought of using the significant pure iron reserves that constitutes our old scrap metal.<br>
<br>
The collection will be held in public by the mayors, who will receive from Messrs. the Prefects the necessary instructions. In principle, this will mean bringing the waste iron objects to the nearest train station.<br>
<br>
I thought the school could have its role to play in this measure of national defense which all the French are invited [to participate in].<br>
<br>
On the one hand, the teachers will show children the essential role of steel in modern warfare, the utility of iron for steelmaking, savings that the country can achieve using its old scrap metal.<br>
<br>
They will also explain to their young students the collection mechanism and, where applicable, the profit that could be gained from the sale of their old iron objects for the families who would possess in abundant reserves (at a rate of 15 Frs. per 100 kg). -<br>
<br>
Children will ensure the safest and most persuasive way the propaganda that does not easily extend to rural villages. They will also carry all the light objects to the collection centers, among which will normally include the town hall and school.<br>
<br>
So I ask you to familiarize the teachers about the importance of this campaign, which should be started immediately and [done with] effective dedication. You will please communicate the attached outline of a lesson plan they will adapt to the various classes, at times developing more widely the scientific and technological aspects.<br>
<br>
You will not fail to communicate to M. the Prefect the terms of this circular, and ask how your participation could be the most useful to him. -<br>

IRON & STEEL IN MODERN WAR - THE COLLECTION OF OLD IRON OBJECTS<br>
<br>
-: -: -: -: -: -: -: -: -: -: -: -: -<br>
<br>
I. - ARMS, in the defensive as in the offensive, saving human lives threatened by the opposing arms. Almost all this armament consists of steel.<br>
<br>
Land Force. Tanks. Guns and rifles. Machine guns. Ammunition.<br>
Air Force. Aircraft - Engines. Guns and machine guns. Shells and bombs.<br>
Sea Force. Battleships, Guns. Ammunition. Torpedoes. Machine tools.<br>
<br>
The greater the equipment, the better that human life can be spared.<br>
<br>
II. - WHERE DOES THE STEEL COME FROM? It is iron prepared in a certain way.<br>
WHERE DOES THE IRON COME FROM? From ore processed with coke.<br>
In higher level classes, you can take this opportunity to remind [the students] about the metallurgy of iron and steel) .-<br>
<br>
III. What are OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES of iron ore & coal.<br>
<br>
(Depending on the class, you can emphasize or slightly pass over this economic geography lesson) .-<br>
Our wartime needs are much greater than in peacetime.<br>
Importing iron, importing coke, means foreign purchases with gold, means weakening the country.<br>
Collecting abandoned iron reserves, without use, is to, therefore, save the gold for the country.<br>
<br>
IV. - SCRAP METAL. - In France, it has never been systematically recovered. And yet we export 500,000 tons annually. It consists of an old bucket, an old cookingpot, a jug with holes, cans, old children’s toys; old kitchen utensils, stoves, cookers, gas stoves or coal; old tools: broken pitchforks, worn plowshares, rusty shovels; old iron beds, etc. ......<br>
All these iron objects save iron ore and coal.<br>
We must gather them.<br>
<br>
V - ROLE OF CHILDREN<br>
<br>
1st - Propaganda in families.<br>
2nd - Search for old objects,<br>
3rd - Transport light objects.<br>
4th - Spiritual Role: Safegaurding soldiers [who are] better armed, better protected; Safeguarding civilians against air attacks; a shortened war.<br>

<br>
Mrs. Lucienne Mazens<br>
<br>
Teacher at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle s/ Tarn</a>)<br>
to Mr. Primary School Inspector<br>
<br>
Inspector,<br>
<br>
I have the honor to inform you that: following the ministerial circular of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">January 10, 1940</a>, 
about the salvage of scrap metal, I made a point to respond by encouraging
students to look for old iron objects.<br>
<br>
And here are the comments that were addressed to me, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Sunday, March 3, 1940</a>, at the
tobacco shop in the hamlet and in front of several people, by somebody who was
temporarily discharged: Mr. Vilette, property-owner in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle s/ Tarn</a>) and
father of a student:<br>
<br>
- “I do not want my son to collect scrap iron, doing so is absolutely useless. “<br>
<br>
And the children, having one day away without permission, thinking that it had not
use, picked up a pile of scrap iron piled outside the door of the blacksmith - I reported
it immediately for that matter - Mr. Vilette thought that it was good to add:<br>
<br>
- “Collecting scrap is encouraging the children to steal, and you can tell that to the
Minister: I do not want my son to steal, I have a well-raised daughter - she went to
Free School of Rabestiens - and I do not want my son to be a thief!”<br>
<br>
So, because I obey my superiors, because I do my duty, I corrupt the youth by inciting
them to theft! I do not need to say what a slap in the face these unspeakable and
unexpected words were for me, condemning the role of the school and impugning my
honor, delivered in public and peremptorily. Choking, I was left without words.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate to see that while some give their lives for the salvation of the country
there are others behind the front lines, who, not satisfied with luxuriating the safety of
their homes, hamper, with their unsuitable and injurious words, the coordinating
efforts of those working for everybody’s protection and who conscientiously execute
their given orders.<br>
<br>
I thought that it was my duty to report such facts.<br>
<br>
Sincerely, Primary School Inspector, my respectful greetings.<br>

NATIONAL POLICE<br>
<br>
On this day <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">23 March 1940</a> at 10 o’clock.<br>
<br>
We, the undersigned, SIGAL, Aimé  and Mercadier, Maurice, gendarmes, at the residence of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle</a>,

leaders, report that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">March 22, 1940</a>, on patrol at the residence and acting pursuant to
a request for information from the prefect of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Tarn</a>, and dated <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">March 13, 1940</a> (No.
1450 / 3 Section on the 16 of the same month) for the purpose of engaging in an
investigation of objectionable speech made on the occasion of the salvage of old scrap
by Mr. Villettes, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a> owner, municipality of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a> (Tarn) have collected
the following statement:<br>
<br>
M. Serres, Marcel, 40, Inspector of Primary Education in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle s/ Tarn</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Tarn</a>), said:<br>
<br>
“Around the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">7 or 8 March 1940</a>, Mrs. Mazen, a teacher at Lapeyrière, municipality of
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a> sent me a letter in which she revealed to me that she had been
subjected to vulgar insults hurled at her by Mr. Vilette inhabitant of Lapeyrière. He
supposedly violently verbally assaulted Mrs. Mazen, in particular, and the
administration, in general, concerning the instructions that were given to schools to
carry out the collection of scrap metal by the students.<br>
<br>
The terms of this letter and the language that she described seemed to me of such a
nature that I did not hesitate to pass it to the appropriate authorities for action.”<br>
<br>
Reading confirmed and signed.<br>
<br>
According to this statement, seeing that this incident took place in Lapeyrière and
continuing the investigation [we] have received the following statements:<br>
<br>
1. - Mr. Galaup, Jules, 75, owner <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>, municipality of Lisle-sur-Tarn (Tarn),
said:<br>
<br>
“On Sunday, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">September 7, 1940</a>, around 3:00 p.m., I was in the hamlet of Lapeyrière,
municipality of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Tarn</a>), when Mr. Vilette challenged Ms. Mazens, a
teacher in said hamlet, about the salvage of scrap metal . Mr. Vilettes said: ‘I have a
daughter who is honest and I do not want my son to be a thief, picking up scrap.’
Madame Mazens replied ‘I do what I was ordered.’ She seemed very touched by these
words. On this I went home as did Mrs. Mazen.<br>
<br>
I need to add that Mr. Vilettes did not insult Mrs. Mazen, he spoke politely.”<br>
<br>
Reading confirmed and signed.<br>
<br>
2. - Mrs. Robert, Juliette, born LARROQUE, age 29, housewife <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>,
municipality of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a>, said:<br>
<br>
“I was in the hamlet of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Sunday, March 7, 1940</a>, at 3:00 p.m., when Mr.
Villettes, Norbert told Mrs. Mazen, the teacher in said place, that his son was not going
to school to learn to be a thief and that from that day on he did not want him to go with
his classmates to collect scrap metal. He added that he had a very honest daughter
and he wanted his son to be the same. Ms. Mazens replied that his son would not
return to the salvage of scrap metal.<br>
<br>
In saying this Mr. Villettes was very polite, however I must say he seemed drunk.”<br>
<br>
Reading confirmed and signed.<br>
<br>
3. Mrs. Landes, Marie-Louise, born LAVAL, age 33, housewife in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>,
municipality of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a>, says<br>
<br>
“On <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Sunday, March 7</a>, around 3:00 p.m., I was in front of my house in Lapeyrière when
Mr. Vilettes, challenged Ms. Mazens teacher at the said place in these terms: “I do not
want my son to go collect scrap, I do not send him to school to learn to be a thief. I have
an honest girl and I want my son to be the same.” Madame Mazens replied: “From this
day your son will not participate in the salvage of scrap metal “and the incident was
closed.<br>
<br>
Mr. Vilettes spoke these words in a natural tone, without raising his voice, yet he
seemed to have drunk more than usual.”<br>
<br>
Reading confirmed and signed.<br>
<br>
4. - Mr. Villettes, Norbert, 42, born June 6, 1897 in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Tarn</a>) son of the late
Elijah and Roucan Antoinette, property-owner in said place, the hamlet <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>,
married with two children, can read and write, raised by his parents until the age of 21,
neither decorated nor pensioner, class of 1917, temporary discharge no. 2, a French
national, declared:<br>
<br>
“It is true that on <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">Sunday, March 7, 1940</a>, around 3:00 p.m. while I was in the hamlet
of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>, I made a comment to Mrs. Mazen, a teacher at the said place, I told this
person and this politely, “I do not want my son to enter uninhabited houses to collect
scrap without being accompanied by the teacher.” And I added that I had a very honest
girl and I wanted my son to be the same, meaning that I did not want my son to be a
thief. I told her also that I did not want my son to go back to the collection of scrap
metal and that for the reasons I stated above and because I knew that four students,
including my son, had entered Mr. Binet’s house which is currently uninhabited.<br>
<br>
Madame Mazens replied that from that day on my son would not collect scrap metal:<br>
<br>
I certify that I spoke politely to Ms Mazens because I respect this person for whom I
have nothing but praise. I do not remember uttering other words against the teacher.
I do not have antipatriotic feelings and it was not for this purpose that I made this
observation to Mrs. Mazen, because my son brought two bags of scrap iron that
belonged to me when we started the salvage drive.<br>
<br>
I regret having made such comments to Ms. Mazens since she took them the wrong
way, in the future I will abstain.”<br>
<br>
Reading confirmed and signed.<br>
<br>
5. - Mr. SAISSAC, Paul, 42, mayor of the town of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">Tarn</a>) said:<br>
<br>
“I have known for many years Mr. Vilettes, Norbert, residing in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Lapeyrière</a>,
municipality of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Lisle-sur-Tarn</a>, he has a good reputation and is perfectly honest. He is
absolutely incapable of knowingly making subversive comments about any subject
whatsoever. Owner-farmer, he harvests a lot of white wine and perhaps loves a bit too
much the product of his labor.”<br>
