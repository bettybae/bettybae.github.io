<center><b>TRUTH AND THE HISTORIAN</b></center><br><br>

WORLD War I has become a fashion and a fad. Musical comedies are written about it, and
high school students collect old helmets and anecdotes about the
sttange behavior of generals. What was once called The Great War
has retreated far enough into the past to seem an oddity and to lose
its force, in our consciousness, as a living memory or an enduring
influence on our lives. It is being interred in the same moldering
but monumental tomb as the Napoleonic and Civil Wars, a subject
for amateur autopsies, a passionate hobby among buffs who collect
its relics with the same degree of zeal that philatelists apply to the
early stamps of British Guiana.<br><br>

Such souvenir-hunting has nothing to do with the work of 
historians, whose professional purposes may be said to be approximately 
the opposite of those of the curio collector: the reconstruction 
of events past with a systematic effort to divest it of the 
picturesque and to see it with fidelity as contemporaries saw it in 
order to understand their motives and purposes. But to see it, too, 
with wider vision and greater accuracy, since the historian enjoys the 
broader view of retrospect and a larger abundance of documents. 
Retrospect, to be sure, produces narrowness as well as breadth. It
has been repeatedly observed (and indeed has become a creed with <b>(p.14)</b>
some historians) that historians can see the past only through the 
distorting lenses of the present and therefore can never see it true, 
and this is, of course, correct. But if he is at all competent the 
historian is aware of this, and he is also aware of the comparable, 
but very different, ophthamological limitations of other 
historians in the intervening seasons. Each age contributes a different 
set of defects of vision, but it also, by that very fact, contributes new 
perceptions as well. Historians are always, as it were, using telephoto and 
wide angle lenses simultaneously as they focuse on their subjects, and it is 
possible to argue that each sees a little more, and a little more accurately, than 
his predecessor.<br><br>

The assertion maybe optimistic. Myopia is often aggravated by 
fashion or circumstance so that the historian of a given age may 
be so preoccupied with the issues of his own world that he tries to 
see the past as an explanation for them. During and immediately 
after the second world war, for example, there was an understandable 
impulse to explain the first in terms of the historical forces 
that seemed to have climaxed in the awful anti-hero, Hitler. Distinguished 
English-speaking historians viewed practically all the 
events of Germany's past as a sort of preparation for the ferocious 
aggressiveness of Germany's present. Such recurrent short-sightedness 
has afflicted the viewers of all past events, and in a larger way 
has prevented, and always will prevent, lasting agreement on such 
problems as the cause and nature of the decline and fall of the 
Roman Empire (if indeed it did decline and fall), or the War of 
the Roses, whose rights and wrongs are still, five hundred years 
after the event, ardently and sometimes hysterically argued between 
adherents of the Houses of Lancaster and York. But varieties of 
interpretation, at any given time misleading, still may contribute to 
enlightenment, as surely as the accumulation of objective facts. The 
vocation of professional historians is precisely this: to revise past 
views in the knowledge that they will never win but that, with 
each new monograph or essay they move further from defeat in the 
game of discovering truth.<br><br>

Since no historical analysis is final, reappraisal is a duty. Since <b>(p.15)</b> 
"relativism", the notion that the past can be seen only from the
distorted standpoint of the present, may lead toward illumination
of a true state of things as well as its concealment, it is useful that
each generation see how the new developments of its time may
adjust the focus of the instrument through which past events are
seen.<br><br>

What follows is an essay in such an adjustment. One of the great 
developments of our day has been the epic, if still very incomplete, 
emancipation of the  African and Asian lands from colonial tutelage 
of European powers. A leading element in this has been the 
complicated interplay of nationalisms, the tired nationalism of the 
Europeans retreating, gracefully or sullenly, before the comparable 
but more vigorous emotions which the Europeans inadvertently but 
inevitably exported to their colonies. Before 1945 it was very rare 
for anyone to see in World War I an episode, or a cause, of this 
vast remodeling of the world. But what has happened since 1945 
undoubtedly lights new aspects of the intricate events that happened 
before 1914. Colonial empires played relatively little part in 
determining the suicidal decisions that led to the devastating events 
of 1914 to 1918. But a generation that has observed the ways in 
which elementary economies and politically inexperienced societies 
can contort the destinies of what used to be called the “civilized” 
nations run by Europeans and their descendants, may in retrospect 
now discern a set of historical phenomena, perhaps materials for 
a new theory of history. The effects of nascent nationalism, still unresolved, 
in areas recently emancipated politically, may properly be 
projected into our view of Europe in the early twentieth century.<br><br>

We know now that such relationships can shake the world; and 
it is the purpose of this book to suggest that one set of such relationships 
shook, and in the end destroyed, the world of European 
Powers in 1914. The peoples and places that caused the explosion 
in that year were located not overseas but within the boundaries of 
what geographers had rather arbitrarily named Europe. But they 
were nonetheless colonial in their situation, and their struggle for 
independence was the model and antecedent of the world struggle <b>(p.16)</b> 
that has developed since 1945.<br><br>

World War I is the name given to a very complicated series of 
events. They were, considered together, the most important events 
of the past hundred and fifty years, and along with those of the 
French Revolution and the Protestant Reformation the most important 
of the last millennium. The war destroyed men, treasure, and 
empires and contorted those that survived; it gave birth to new and 
unexpected forces; and it greatly speeded the development of many 
tendencies already in course. It demolished institutions and ideas 
that in 1914 had been, although already weakening, still strong, 
such as the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian empires, and monarchy 
and aristocracy. It demolished equally institutions like the 
German Empire and ideas like anarchism, which had seemed imposingly 
vigorous. It gave impetus to forces already born whose 
destiny had been still uncertain and whose reputation still doubtful: 
democracy; the self-determination of nations, the rights of women. 
It enormously speeded secular shifts of power already in the making, 
most notably the rise of the United States of America to economic 
and military pre-eminence, and the corresponding decline of 
the capacity of the Great Powers of Europe to control their own 
destinies. It decimated a generation of future leaders and producers, 
and for thiry years shook the political poise and interrupted 
the economic growth of Europe. It inaugurated an era in 
which colonial empires, which seemed powerful and permanent 
in 1914, were to disintegrate. It precipitated the Russian revolution 
and released communism as a world force led by the Soviet Union. 
Far from removing the causes of future war-the Allies proclaimed 
that as their aim--it wrecked the insufficient but not 
ineffective systems and habits that had provided peace in Europe 
for forty-five years before its outbreak. And it did all these things 
in four years; its most spectacular consequence was the effect it had 
upon the timing of history. It reduced Great Powers, unprepared 
in psychology or in policy, to permanent weakness, and it thrust 
the United States, also unprepared, into a position of world responsibility.<br><br>

<b>(p.17)</b> What caused it? The question is unanswerable, for the war was
many things, not one, and the meanings of the word “cause” are
also many. To discern the cause of any event, even a single and
simple event, is to advance a definition of the word. To discuss
causes at all is to move from the historian's world of concrete
things, statutes, treaties, battles, and mobs, to the shadowy and
metaphysical landscape of the philosophers.<br><br>

The essay that follows singles out for emphasis a particular
group of circumstances and chains of events that preceded the
outbreak of the first World War, the effects of the emerging nations
of central and southeastern Europe upon the established
Great Powers. To argue that they form <i>the</i> cause is to gamble with
semantics and with the philosophy of history. Other causes-the
changing balance of military power in Europe, the growing social
tensions within European nations, the shrillness of chauvinists and
the stridency of a semiliterate press and public, Anglo-German
rivalry, Franco-German hostility, Russian expansionism, colonial
conflicts, commercial competition-all these have been studied and
restudied. All of them were causes of what became the first World
War. But the war, that vast phenomenon, grew out of a single
international event, which was the conflict between the Habsburg
Monarchy and the kingdom of Serbia. Had Austria-Hungary been
differently constituted, had Serbia posed a less lethal threat to it,
there would have been no Austro-Serbian war in 1914; and if a
general war had come later, it would have been fought on different
terms and taken different forms. It was the system of alliances
and the changing balance of military power in Europe that converted
a Balkan dispute into a world war, but it did not cause
the particular war that happened to be fought.<br><br>

For a hundred years and more, Europe, the prosperous and stable
Europe of the west and the north, had suffered from the complexities
of the lands and peoples of the east and the southeast, whose
difficulties have intruded themselves on Great Powers and have,
by magnetic attraction, drawn Great Powers into conflict. Here are
illuminated, in a sort of gigantic microcosm, the problems of <b>(p.18)</b> 
conflicting and emerging nationalism, the problems of economic 
and political immaturity, the problems of attempting solutions 
by means that worked in the West and which were the only means 
that anyone knew to apply to new nations.<br><br>

There were deep and abiding sources of conflict in the rest 
of Europe. But to a surprising degree they were intertwined with 
the turmoil of the nationalities in Austria-Hungary and the Balkans. 
If the Germans pushed Austria into war in 1914-and there 
is much evidence that they did something of the sort-they did it 
largely because they apprehended that a general war was someday 
inevitable and that, if it had to be fought, this was the most favorable 
time to fight it. But the thing that made general war seem 
inevitable to the Germans was the existence of the Franco-Russian 
alliance, which they viewed as a form of encirclement ultimately 
directed against them; and the Franco-Russia alliance was, indirectly 
anyway, the product of Austrian and Balkan developments 
a generation before. In tracing almost any of the circumstances 
that were most critical in 1914, one is led back to the national 
conflicts of Central and Southeastern Europe.<br><br>

It is perhaps artificial so to make selections and emphases. But 
the study of history 1s always a study of patterns, of sorting out different 
hypotheses, of imposing different sorts of order on the confusion 
of raw facts, of finding in the present new clues to the past.
The history of the history of the causes of World War I demonstrates
these propositions.<br><br>

Until the moment when German troops crossed the Belgian 
border and entered the frontier villages on the early morning of 
August 4, 1914, the conduct of the affairs of state that led to 
the invasion had been in the hands of diplomats, politicians, and 
military advisers. At that moment the events of the recent past 
were transferred to the hands of others, of publicists and propagandists. 
For four years an unconscionable volume of self-defense 
and corresponding vilification was poured forth. None of it was 
accurate, let alone complete. Official publications-the <i>British Blue 
Book</i>, the <i>French Yellow Book</i>, the <i>German White Book</i>, the <b>(p.19)</b>
<i>Austrian Red Book</i>, the <i>Russian Orange Book</i>-sought to demonstrate, 
by a judicious selection from the archives, the moral purity 
of each nation and its allies and the depravity of the enemy. The 
selections were by necessity small, and by reason of their purpose 
highly misleading. Judicious omissions were sometimes supplemented 
by falsification. Legends were accepted in the belief that 
the end of victory justified an incautious credulity for rumors.<br><br>

The belief was sound. For every nation the necessary sacrifices 
imposed by war had to be justified by belief in the guilt of the 
enemy for starting it, and the necessary energy had to be ignited 
by enthusiasm and hatred. There is no doubt that this was true; 
modern wars are fought largely by emotion and by the creative 
power that emotion, properly directed, can release. Where the 
conviction of the public about the righteousness of its cause 
faltered, as it did in Russia, the nation at war collapsed into an 
appalling tangle of distraught individuals. Leaders elsewhere, 
whose moral and legal obligation was to prevent precisely such a 
calamity, were shrewd and skillful enough to promote the calling 
forth of hatred. The public response was gratifying.<br><br>

When the peace treaty was at length written, it became expedient 
for quite accidental reasons to include in it, in passing, the statement 
that “the Allied and Associated Governments affirm and and 
Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for 
causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated 
Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence 
of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of 
Germany and her allies.” So thoroughly had the opinion among 
the Allied and Associated governments been convinced of the 
responsibility of Germany and Austria-Hungary for deliberately 
starting the first World War that the statement passed almost 
unnoticed in Britain, France, and the United States. But in Germany, 
where precisely the opposite view of the origins of the war 
had been implanted and received with precisely the same degree 
of passionate acceptance, the passage was regarded not only as 
wholly untrue but as further evidence of the ineffable hypocrisy <b>(p.20)</b> 
of the enemy states. The discussion of moral guilt for starting the 
war, instead of fading away when the war ended, was renewed 
with greater intensity than ever. Instead of being fought by publicists, 
the battle of “war guilt” now became the concern of whole 
armies of historians. The flow of literature was torrential. No historical 
subjects except the American Civil War and the French 
Revolution had ever been examined with this exhausting thoroughness. 
Regular periodicals devoted to the causes of the war were 
established, and flourished. Day-by-day accounts of the crisis were 
followed by hour-by-hour and, literally, minute-by-minute accounts. 
It was clear, for example, that the sequence of receipt and dispatch 
of diplomatic telegrams was very important, and there were 
erudite articles computing the time required in different capitals for decoding.<br><br> 

In the 1920's in Britain and America, there was a contagion of 
breast-beating. What was called “revisionism,” one of whose 
forebears was a sullen economic expert on the British delegation 
at the Peace Conference named John Maynard Keynes who dramatized 
both the economic and the moral defects of Allied policies, 
became popular. Moved by embarrassment at the hysterical excesses 
of wartime propaganda, and faced with what seemed incontrovertible 
evidence in the impressively edited collections of 
German documents that the German Republic was bringing out, 
British and American historians discovered that the Germans had 
certainly not been guilty of planning a world war and that the 
conduct of the Russian, the French, and even the British governments 
conspicuously failed to demonstrate any single-minded devotion 
to the preservation of peace.<br><br>

Then the approach of a second World War, and the startling 
evolution of a new Germany that was not only openly but boastfully 
aggressive, caused a species of counterrevisionism to emerge. 
Historians began to apprehend everywhere that there was something 
deep and rooted in the German people and the German 
state that led them to undertake wars of aggression. <br><br>

The river of literature subsided. There were now more <b>(p.21)</b> 
immediate subjects of interest, and it seemed that almost all that
could be said about 1914 had been said. From the mid-thirties
on, there was a rapid decline in writings about 1914.<br><br>

But the river did not dry up. There appeared, a few years after 
the end of the war, the immense and imposing work of Luigi 
Albertini, by all odds the most compendious, reliable, and closely 
reasoned of all treatments. Albertini had not merely studied the 
documents and memoirs--studied more of them, since more were 
available--than had earlier scholars. He had also interviewed 
many of the statesmen, starting in 1919, and had asked them 
embarrassing questions. <br><br>

The trend of Albertini's conclusions was to some extent in the 
fashion of the times: he found the Germans unquestionably 
guilty. Not by any means solely guilty, not guilty of planning a 
world war years in a~vance, but unquestionably guilty of urging 
Austria to attack Serbia at the known risk of a general war. <br><br> 

This interpretation of 1914 is now generally held among those 
who write about it. Indeed, the reinculpation of Germany has since 
been carried much farther than it was by Albertini. On the fortieth 
anniversary of the crisis, for example, the Regius Professor of 
History at Oxford published in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> 
a commemorative article in which he said that it had been finally 
and definitely “proved that the War was caused by deliberate 
German aggression.” The single fact produced in support of 
this assertion by Professor Trevor-Roper would not seem final 
or definite to a close student of the chronology of events, but his 
attitude is nonetheless illuminating. Seven years later, the distinguished 
German historian Fritz Fischer published a history of 
German policy before and during the war called <i>Griff Nach der 
Weltmacht</i>. In it he said that he was not concerned with the 
allocation of guilt; still, he allocated it, concluding that the German 
leaders “bear an important portion of the responsibility” for 
the European war.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[1]</a> In demonstration of this, he produced new <b>(p.22)</b> 
evidence of a damning sort, and argued with considerable force
that a policy of willingness to embark on preventive war had been
decided before the crisis, based on a wildly optimistic appraisal of
German chances for victory. Austria-Hungary, he said, was to a
large extent pushed into war at German insistence. His book
occasioned much discussion and some shock in Germany.<br><br>

Professor Fischer's treatment of the crisis is brief; most of his 
materials have been used before and subjected to different interpretations. 
Anyone who has read his account must admit that 
the Germanns, were, at least, frivolously willing to contemplate the 
possibility of a “preventive war” and were exploiting the occasion 
for a “grab at world power"; still, his treatment is very 
narrowly of the German side of things, and a wider survey indicates 
clearly that the Germans were by no means the only people 
who were prepared to risk a war and who had expansionist 
programs in their minds. Russians were also ready to grasp at 
world power. And the fact remains that it was the crisis of AustroSerb 
relations that brought these and other ambitions and alarms 
into open conflict. The question of the guilt of individuals and 
nations dissolves, as Fischer admits, into an ocean of general 
responsibility.<br><br> 

By now, after more than fifty years, it is possible to view the 
question of war guilt as a fact, and not a purpose, of history. The 
controversy is by now a topic deserving historical analysis. It is 
time to write a book explaining why historians in the past have 
been so beguiled by it. The historian dealing with 1914 can by 
now say that a great many European statesmen in 1914 were irresponsible 
in their attitude toward the possibility of war, and can 
try to explain why, without making judgments on their morals. 
One most important consideration to bear in mind is this: Irresponsibility, 
even for those Germans who devoutly believed that 
they could win and that a general war was both necessary and desirable, 
was limited by the fact that they did not know what was 
going to happen once the war started. They did not envisage four <b>(p.23)</b> 
years of horror; they did not envisage social revolutions and the 
collapse of Europe. <br><br>

Or at least, very few of them did. One of the few, oddly, was 
the German chief of staff, Helmuth von Moltke, who is said to 
have feared that a general war would mean the annihilation of 
the civilization of Europe for decades to come. He was approximately 
correct; still, he was prepared to urge measures that he 
knew would bring a general war. And this is the sign of another 
limitation. Moltke, although an indifferent chief of staff, was an 
obedient subject and a patriot; and he believed that, once war 
threatened, the safety of Germany required certain measures that 
would bring it closer. The soldiers' job was to make sure that 
war was fought on favorable terms; Moltke was obeying the 
imperatives of his position. <br><br> 

Statesmen, like soldiers, obeyed the imperatives of their offices 
in a system of competing and frightened national states. When the 
catastrophe took place, they were help responsible, reasonably
enough. But the responsibility was the monopoly of no man and no 
nation; rather it inhered in the offices and institutions, in the 
system of European states and its shortcomings. <br><br>

"War guilt” is an historical phenomenon, one that came into 
existence only after the public discussion of responsibility began 
in August, 1914. Like the war itself, it belonged to a species of 
familiar phenomena which, because of unforseeable circumstances, 
assumed a scale so vast as to create a new order of magnitude. 
But no one who was making the decisions in 1914 knew that 
either the war or the question of responsibility for starting it was 
to introduce a new dimension into history. <br><br>

<center><b>CHAPTER SEVEN</b></center><br><br>

<center><b>THE BREAKDOWN OF EUROPE</b></center><br><br>

<i>The Ultimatum Rejected</i><br><br>

THE timed note was duly 
delivered to the Serbian government by the Austrian Minister at 
Belgrade at six o'clock on the afternoon of July 23, 1914. For its 
time it was a formidable document, perhaps, as Grey was to say 
of it, the most formidable document ever presented by one independent 
state to another.<br><br>

The note began with a long preamble recallmg the obligations 
the Serbs had assumed, in the humbling aftermath of Bosnia, to 
refrain from provoking Austria-Hungary, and proceeded to assert 
that, far from honoring this promise, they had encouraged the 
growth of a subversive movement aimed at “detaching a part of the 
territories of Austria-Hungary from the Monarchy. The culpable 
tolerance” of the Serbian government had permitted, the preamble 
continued “all manifestations of a nature to incite the Serbian 
population to hatred of the Monarchy and contempt of its institutions,” 
as well as the making of the conspiracy against the Heir to 
the Throne on Serbian territory. The results of the plot were to 
impose upon the government of the Monarchy “the duty of putting <b>(p.226)</b> 
to an end the intrigues which form a perpetual menace to the 
tranquility of the Monarchy.”<br><br> 
 
All this was true enough, although by the standards of diplomatic 
usage it was stated with staggering baldness. What followed 
was much balder. There were ten demands, starkly but not precisely 
phrased. The imprecision may have been intentional, or it may 
have represented the difficulties of securing agreement on the 
purpose of the note. The first three required the immediate cessation 
of anti-Austrian publications, the dissolution of anti-Austrian societies 
(the relatively harmless <i>Narodna 0brana</i> was mentioned 
by name, but not the guilty Black Hand, of whose existence the 
Austro-Hungarian government was ignorant), and the elimination 
of anti-Austrian books and instruction from Serbian schools. The 
fourth required the removal from office of anti-Austrian civil 
servants and army officers whose “names and deeds” the Monarchy 
"reserved the right of communicating” to the Serbian government 
--a demand that at least suggested that the Serbian government 
must fire anybody the Monarchy wanted fired.<br><br> 
 
But this was only the beginning. The fifth demand required “the 
collaboration of representatives” of Austria-Hungary for the 
suppression of the subversive movement directed against the territorial 
integrity of the Monarchy; the sixth required the participation 
of delegates of Austria-Hungary in an investigation leading to 
trial of the conspirators and their accessories. The seventh required 
the arrest of Tanksovich and Ciganovich, the two leading conspirators 
in Serbian territory. The eighth required effective measures to 
prevent illegal frontier traffic, and punishment of conniving frontier 
officials. The ninth demanded explanations of “unjustifiable 
utterances of high Serbian officials,” apparently but not certainly in 
connection with the assassination; and the last required that the 
Austro-Hungarian government be notified without delay of the 
measures taken to execute the previous demands. Unconditional 
acceptance with forty-eight hours was required. On the early morning 
of July 24, the news of the ultimatum began to filter into 
foreign capitals. And Europe began to erupt.<br><br> 

<b>(p.227)</b> The first and most violent of the volcanic reactions was of course 
in Saint Petersburg. There, the Foreign Minister, exhausted by the 
festivities in honor of the departing French, was wakened by a terrible 
alarm: the text of the ultimatum, received by wire from Belgrade 
at seven that morning. Sazonov, dilatory but volatile, was 
furious: “This means a European war,” he prophetically cried, and 
berated the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador with charges of criminal 
bellicosity. In more diplomatic language, the Ambassador wired to 
Vienna, “The minister ... was noncompliant and hostile.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> The 
Emperor Nicholas II, never quick to grasp implications, professed 
himself disturbed.<br><br> 

The flames of Sazonov's fury were fed at the luncheon given that 
day for him-and the British Ambassador-by the French Ambassador. 
Paleologue, instead of trying to soothe him, encouraged him 
in his rage with advocacy of a firm policy and renewed assurances 
of French support. But these affirmations were scarcely needed. 
Sazonov, like most of the important people in Russia, had been 
convinced by a hasty reading of the ultimatum that war was possible 
and might be imminent, and, in his anger, he was already 
anxious to take military measures.<br><br> 
 
The reasons for the violence of this reaction, like the reasons for 
the demands that provoked it, were cumulative. Sazonov, whose 
personality was in some ways similar to Berchtold's, was in a rather 
similar position. He was inclined to indecision and superficiality. 
His record, since he had succeeded Izvolsky, had been far from brilliant. 
Like Berchtold, he had been criticized for insufficient resolution. 
Berchtold's humiliations in 1912 had been succeeded by 
Sazonov's in the Liman von Sanders affair. But unlike Berchtold 
he was given to passions, and now he was in the middle of one.<br><br> 
 
The personality of the Foreign Minister was not the only thing 
that directed Russian policy toward ferocity after the delivery of the 
Austrian ultimatum, although it was the most important. Sazonov 
was only one of many influential people who had been developing a 
morbid distrust of the Central Powers, as Germany and Austria- <b>(p.228)</b> 
Hungary were called. The army, and in particular, Grand Duke 
Nicholas, the commander-in-chief, were belligerently anti-German. 
Liman von Sanders had confirmed well-founded suspicions, long 
growing, that the Germans were themselves working toward domination 
of Turkey. The German patronage of the Turks, the Berlin-Bagdad 
Railway, the general aura of German chauvinism, confirmed 
the statements of German publicists that German destinies lay “in 
the East.” The Russian preoccupation with Constantinople made 
them view the <i>Drang nach Osten</i>-the German “Drive to the East” 
-as a matter vital to Russian national interest and national 
honor. Since Constantinople did not belong to Russia (and never 
could, without a major war), it was difficult for them to complain 
about the merely suspected threats of Germany to it. But almost 
everything that had happened since the embarrassment of 1908 had 
been interpreted in the light of a sinister plot to secure something 
that the Russians wanted for themselves. The only socially acceptable 
counter to this plot was to insist on the rights of the Balkan 
peoples to develop free from “Germanic” interference (by which 
was meant interference from either Austria-Hungary or Germany). 
Russia therefore had presented itself, from time to time, as the protector 
of the independence and the aspirations of the Balkan 
peoples. But this altruistic concern veiled a dog in the manger, 
whose existence was perfectly, though tacitly, apprehended everywhere.<br><br>
 
It was therefore natural that the Russians should see in the 
ultimatum a German plot to occupy the Balkans, and a form of indirect 
aggression against Russia. Many other people thought so, 
too. For this reason the Austrian failure to prepare the ground by 
suitable advance explanations was doubly ill judged; and for this 
reason Sazonov had gone off half-cocked on Friday, July 24. 
Purple with rage, he told the German Ambassador to his face that 
Austria was planning to gobble the Balkans piecemeal and that 
Germany was conniving in the project. On Friday evening, at seven 
o'clock, he had a talk with the Serbian Minister, Spalaikovich, at 
Saint Petersburg, in which he apparently said that Russia would <b>(p.229)</b> 
support Serbia and may have urged that the Austrian demands 
should not be accepted. And he proposed that the Russian Army 
should be mobilized against Austria as a form of deterrent. 
 
All of this was ill considered; the mobilization proposal was 
proof of it. It put Russia in the position of being the first Power to 
consider military measures. Moreover, it violated the very carefully 
laid mobilization plans that had been developed on the assumption 
that Austria-Hungary and Germany would fight together; mobilization 
against Austria alone would throw out all the intricate planning, 
and would mean the reallocation of reserves. But the general 
fury was so strong that the rash project was accepted in principle. 
At a Council of Ministers on Saturday, July 25, it was agreed that 
measures preliminary to mobilization--called the Period Preparatory 
to War-should be decreed, and that, if Austrian forces 
entered Serbia, Russian mobilization against Austria would be proclaimed.<br><br> 
 
In less than forty-eight hours after the delivery of the timed note, 
then, the Russian Army was alerted for “mobilization.” The term, 
now obsolete, deserves comment. Mobilization was a recognized act 
and condition; it meant not merely, as the word suggests, making 
the armies mobile, but also calling up reserves, canceling leaves, 
transferring troops to battle stations, imposing martial law in 
frontier areas, manning fortresses, taking over rail transport, and a 
thousand other measures that transformed the standing army into 
a much larger national force ready for action. It involved very 
careful and detailed plans in advance which, like all military plans, 
were practically impossible to alter, and difficult to arrest, once they 
began to be carried out. It was sometimes stated before 1914 that 
"mobilization means war.” This was not in any literal sense true, 
but there <i>were</i> implications in mobilization even more serious than 
the mere difficulty of halting it once started. One was the matter of 
timing, already noted as a crucial consideration in the making of 
the Schlieffen Plan. Once one neighbor started to mobilize, another 
neighbor was practically obliged to do so if he were not to be left 
defenseless in the face of an enemy poised for attack. The fact that <b>(p.230)</b> 
support Serbia and may have urged that the Austrian demands
should not be accepted. And he proposed that the Russian Army
should be mobilized against Austria as a form of deterrent.
All of this was ill considered; the mobilization proposal was
proof of it. It put Russia in the position of being the first Power to
consider military measures. Moreover, it violated the very carefully
laid mobilization plans that had been developed on the assumption
that Austria-Hungary and Germany would fight together; mobilization
against Austria alone would throw out all the intricate planning,
and would mean the reallocation of reserves. But the general
fury was so strong that the rash project was accepted in principle.
At a Council of Ministers on Saturday, July 25, it was agreed that
measures preliminary to mobilization--called the Period Preparatory
to War-should be decreed, and that, if Austrian forces
entered Serbia, Russian mobilization against Austria would be proclaimed.
In less than forty-eight hours after the delivery of the timed note,
then, the Russian Army was alerted for “mobilization.” The term,
now obsolete, deserves comment. Mobilization was a recognized act
and condition; it meant not merely, as the word suggests, making

a much larger national force ready for action. It involved very
careful and detailed plans in advance which, like all military plans,
were practically impossible to alter, and difficult to arrest, once they

"mobilization means war.” This was not in any literal sense true,
but there were implications in mobilization even more serious than
the mere difficulty of halting it once started. One was the matter of
timing, already noted as a crucial consideration in the making of
the Schlieffen Plan. Once one neighbor started to mobilize, another
neighbor was practically obliged to do so if he were not to be left
defenseless in the face of an enemy poised for attack. The fact that <b>(p.230)</b> 
Russia--because of huge areas, poor transport, and general bureaucratic 
lethargy-required much longer for mobilization than any 
other Power undoubtedly played a role in Russian calculations on 
Friday and Saturday, July 24 and 25. The clumsiness of Russian 
military arrangements required early decision, but once the decision 
had been taken it meant a threat to Austria-Hungary and Germany. <br><br>
 
Sazonov, in his impulsiveness, had conceived the foolish scheme 
of mobilization against Austria merely as a form of pressure, a 
political action. But the dangers of trying to improvise an unplanned 
partial mobilization were fully understood by Russian generals, and 
it was because of them that mobilization was, in the Council on Saturday, 
delayed pending actual invasion of Serbia. The Period 
Preparatory to War, however, was quite ominous enough to drive 
home the danger of the situation. The hair-trigger reaction of the 
volatile Sazonov had already transformed a Balkan into a world 
crisis. The decisive step had been delayed, and Sazonov's temper 
began to cool; there followed a brief period when he and his 
colleagues showed a greater willingness to try to reach a diplomatic 
settlement. <br><br>
 
Reactions elsewhere to the ultimatum were strong but not violent. 
In Rome, the government contented itself with pointing out that if 
war resulted from the Austrian ultimatum, Italy would not be 
obliged, under the terms of the Triple Alliance, to take part in it, 
since it would not be the result of an aggressive action against 
Austna or Germany. In Paris, Bienvenu-Martin, the Minister of 
Justice, was in charge of the government-the President and the 
Prime Minister (who was also Foreign Minister), being afloat in 
the Baltic, could be communicated with only via radio from Stockholm. 
The reactions of the Justice Minister were on the whole mild; 
in conversation with the Austrian Ambassador he expressed a 
fnendly understanding of the Austrian problem in connection with 
Serbia. The reaction of the seaborne dignitaries was confined to 
urging, by radio, that Serbia request an extension of the time limit. <br><br>

In London, reactions were mildest of all. The government was 
deeply involved in the Irish problem, and a Cabinet meeting <b>(p.231),</b> 
devoted to it occupied a good deal of the day on Friday, July 24, and, 
no doubt, much of the attention of Sir Edward Grey. On Saturday 
the ministers dispersed for weekends in the country, in accordance 
with the pleasant British custom. Sir Edward remained in town for 
the night, but although he grasped the formidable nature of the 
Austrian demands and was concerned to prevent complications, 
his attitude was curiously detached. Britain, he said, could take no 
direct part in a Balkan crisis, and added that British opinion would 
never support a war on behalf of Serbia. He realized that Russian 
reaction was bound to be strong, and he actually approved and 
encouraged the Russian program for partial mobilization as a 
legitimate form of political pressure. He hoped that the time limit 
on the ultimatum might be extended. In conversation with French 
Ambassador Jules Carnbon, he suggested that the four Great Powers 
less immediately concerned in the affair, Britain, France, Germany, 
and Italy, ought to mediate.<br><br> 
 
Mediation was a recognized form of diplomatic activity, a somewhat 
less formal and precise version of arbitration. Its applicability 
to the present situation was, however, questionable. The problem 
was what was to be mediated, and between whom. Cambon suggested 
mediation by the four Powers of the dispute between Austria 
and Serbia, and this Grey proposed at once to the German Ambassador, 
Prince Lichnowsky, on the late afternoon of Friday, July 24. 
The proposal was badly received. Austria and Serbia were not 
equals; for Austria to accept mediation would be to compromise its 
dignity. But as between Austria and Russia, if trouble arose, mediation 
by the othn Powers would be possible. The suggestion was sent 
to Berlin, with Lichnowsky's backing. Tardily, and in a way that 
gives every reason to doubt their good faith, the German authorities 
told Lichnowsky that they would accept the British proposal should 
the occasion arise. They also said that they had forwarded Grey's 
simultaneous suggestion for an extension of the time limit to 
Vienna, but this they delayed doing until after the time limit had 
expired.<br><br> 
 
Sir Edward was already being urged by his own officials to do <b>(p.232)</b> 
something more positive than this. It was pointed out to him that 
Great Britain, not committed by alliance, was in a position to bring 
strong pressure to bear. This could be done by threatening Germany 
with British participation in any European war on the side of the 
Entente Powers. But this Grey refused to do. With his diplomatic 
scruples, and perhaps because he did not fully grasp the dangers of 
the situation, he thought it would be improper to do privately what 
he could not dare do publicly; it would have been constitutionally 
dubious and politically perilous. Opinion would not support him, 
in either the country or the Cabinet; there was a powerful, articulate, 
perhaps predominant, school of thought, well represented among 
the ministers, strongly opposed to any steps likely to lead to British 
participation in a war that seemed likely to benefit no nation so 
much as autocratic Russia. Moreover, Grey believed that Britain, 
standing aloof and invoking the good offices of Germany and France 
and Italy, and the good sense, if any, of Russia and Austria, could 
perform its most useful service. Now convinced, apparently, that 
he had done so--and having delayed for a day his customary weekend 
in the interests of saving the world from war-he departed for 
a well-earned rest at his cottage in the country.<br><br> 
 
It is impossible to say that a more positive British policy would 
have had any effect on the course of action. It is uncertain that even 
in the absence of the Irish crisis a more positive policy would have 
been possible. It is an undoubted fact that the Cabinet and the 
public viewed the Serbian situation as remote from British interests, 
and were recalcitrantly reluctant to envisage a British commitment 
to engage in hostilities, which limited Grey's ability to make very 
effective threats. But Ireland had its effect: the Germans were counting 
on Ireland to distract British attention, and they believed it was 
doing so.<br><br>
 
The reactions to the ultimatum in Berlin are Jess clear. Many of 
the German leaders, including the Emperor, were still on their 
holidays. The Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary, however, were 
back in Berlin, resolute in their support for Austria-Hungary nowhere 
is there any documented echo on their part of <b>(p.233)</b> 
Zimmerman's reaction to the text of the ultimatum that it was “too sharp.” 
As will be seen presently, it seems probable that Bethmann-Hollweg 
and Jagow were urging Vienna to act, and to act fast. The line they 
took with other governments was to express hopes that the AustroSerbian 
dispute should be “localized.” This word, much used by 
German ambassadors abroad in their discussions with agitated 
foreign ministers, sounded well. It suggested a due concern for 
European peace. But the notion was either na"ive or disingenuous; 
to localize the Austro-Serb dispute meant, simply, letting Austria 
have its way and preventing anybody's interfering with its projected 
crushing of the Serbs. And this meant preventing the Russians from 
interfering. <br><br>
 
It will be observed that, while the Germans thought Russia must 
and could be prevented from interfering, the Russians thought that 
Austria must be persuaded or threatened into abandoning its project. 
The two notions were precisely incompatible. <br><br>
 
In Belgrade, after the delivery of the Austro-Hungarian demands, 
there was at first confusion. The Prime Minister was on a 
campaign trip in southern Serbia, and did not get back to the capital 
until Friday morning. What happened when he did is not certain. 
Many historians assumed (in the absence of any reliable documentary 
evidence from the Serbian archives) that the Serbian ministers, 
from their first glance, found the demands unacceptable. This is to 
some extent borne out by the reported first reaction of Ljuba Jovanovich, 
"Well, there is nothing to do but die fighting";<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> and by the 
spirited tone of defiance the Serbian Foreign Office sounded in its 
notes to foreign governments. But the most authoritative writer, 
Luigi Albertini, has been at pains to prove that this was not the 
case. The government, he says, was acutely aware of the military 
inadequacy and political weakness of Serbia; they knew, of course, 
that it did not stand a chance against Austria. The Serbian ministers 
abroad, and especially in Saint Petersburg, were asking for foreign 
aid and support; unless it was forthcoming, Albertini believes, the <b>(p.234)</b> 
 ministers were prepared to consider accepting the Austrian demands 
-unconditionally or with reservations. He produces much suggestive 
information to support the theory, which seems on the face 
of it plausible; in such circumstances, differences of opinion were to 
be expected. And it is also plausible to accept the statement of another 
Italian scholar that the Serbian chief of staff urged, and the 
Cabinet agreed, that no decision be reached until Russian advice had 
been solicited. <br><br>

Russian advice was presently available. Sazonov, it will be remembered, 
had a talk with the Serbian Minister at Saint Petersburg 
at seven on the evening of Friday the twenty-fourth. Published 
accounts of this conversation indicate that Sazonov urged on the 
Serbs a calm and conciliatory attitude, but the documents are 
unreliable in this case and from what is known of the Russian 
Foreign Minister's mood that day, it seems unlikely that he did so. 
It is at least probable that he told Spalaikovich that Russia would 
support Serbia and that he was trying to secure approval for partial 
Russian mobilization; there is circumstantial evidence to suggest 
that this was indeed the tenor of the conversation. In any case, the 
news of the Russian military measures, along with Spalaikovich's 
dispatch, did reach Belgrade at noon on Saturday, six hours before 
the expiry of the time limit. In those six hours the Serbian response 
to the ultimatun took a definite, and determined, form. <br><br>

At three o'clock Saturday afternoon, the Serbs ordered the mobilization 
of the army. They made plans, the execution of which began 
immediately, to transfer the government from Belgrade, dangerously 
exposed to Austrian guns across the Danube, to southern 
Serbia. And they drew up their answer to the ultimatwn. The translation 
of the text was completed barely in time to be delivered to 
the Austro-Hungarian Legation at the moment the time limit expired. <br><br>

The Serbian reply was a masterpiece of diplomatic language, 
especially considering the speed with which it was composed. The 
Serbs had been advised by everybody to be conciliatory, and they 
were; butter remained visibly unmelted in their mouths. Five of <b>(p.235)</b> 
the ten demands were accepted outright; four others with reservations 
or reasonable requests for clarification. Only the sixth, the 
somewhat anomalous demand that Austro-Hungarian agents collaborate 
in investigations relating to the bringing to trial of accessories 
to the plot, was rejected. The appearance of the reply was so conciliatory, 
even sycophantic, as to be seriously embarrassing to the 
Austrians, who felt obliged before passing it to their representatives 
abroad to append a long essay pointing out in precisely what ways it 
was evasively and cunningly contrived to negate the reality of the 
demands.<br><br> 
 
The Serbs had done the best they could, which was from one 
point of view the best imaginable. The Austrians were correct; the 
reply, if carefully analyzed, was very far from acceptance, although 
it made a telling propaganda point and served the Serbian cause 
well. But as far as the Austrians went, the subtleties of the text were 
of no importance. The Austrian Minister, Baron Giesl, was already 
under orders to reject any reply that was not a complete and 
unconditional acceptance. The text was handed him at six o'clock on 
Saturday evening. He immediately signed and sent off a previously 
prepared note announcing to the Serbs the breaking off of diplomatic 
relations; then he burned the code books and managed to catch 
the six-thirty train from the Belgrade station, where he noted crowds 
of soldiers already answering the proclamation of mobilization 
issued three hours earlier. By six-forty that evening, the train had 
crossed the Danube bridge and Giesl was on Habsburg territory. 
By six-forty-five, he was on the telephone to Tisza, in Budapest, 
from the Hungarian frontier town; all that was needed, in reply to 
Tisza's anxious question, was a single word to inform him that the 
reply had been unsatisfactory and that relations had been broken.<br><br> 
 
<i>Austria Goes to War</i><br><br> 
 
The reaction in Austria-Hungary to the Serbian rejection of the 
ultimatum (everybody was calling it that now, forgetting the minute 
distinction of a “timed note") was varied, reflecting the deep <b>(p.236)</b> 
differences that had accompanied its drafting. Public opinion in 
Vienna was jubilant; when the news broke, there were parades and 
singing in the streets and what the British Ambassador referred to as 
"a frenzy of delight.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> The delight, if not the frenzy, was presumably 
shared by the war party and its leader, General Conrad, who 
now at last received permission to mobilize against Serbia. It was not 
shared by the Emperor, who wearily observed on receiving the news 
of the diplomatic break that it did not necessarily mean war; or by 
Tisza, who still hoped for a diplomatic settlement. And it is not 
certain that it was shared by Count Berchtold, who seems to have 
regarded acceptance as a serious possibility and who had written on 
July 2 I (before the ultimatum was sent, but after its terms were decided) 
to the Austrian Ambassador at Rome indicating that he 
hoped for a peaceful solution. <br><br>

Mobilization, against Serbia alone, not general mobilization, 
was authorized. Conrad decided to take preliminary steps on Monday 
(it being now late Saturday night) and to proclaim it publicly 
on Tuesday, July 28. But no decision to declare war was made. Conrad, 
asked for the date when he could conveniently commence 
hostilities, replied that August 12 would be suitable. It would take 
some time to complete mobilization. There did not appear to be 
much sense of urgency in Vienna. <br><br>

Reactions differed elsewhere. In the country for his abbreviated 
weekend, Sir Edward Grey received on Sunday morning the alarming 
news of the break in relations, along with a suggestion from the 
head of the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, that it might be 
well to renew in a different form the proposal for Four-Power 
discussions of the problem. What Nicolson suggested specifically, 
and what was then proposed to the governments concerned, was 
an ambassadors' conference along the lines of that which had been 
successful in ending the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. The 
precedent was a happy one, but now the circumstances were different, 
for it was a question, not of a conference of Great Powers to 
deal with a small war among the Balkan countries, but rather of one 
to settle a dispute between one Balkan country and one of their <b>(p.237)</b> 
own number. Nonetheless, it seemed to be the best thing the British 
could propose, given the fact that Sir Edward thought circumstances 
precluded him from exerting pressure on either his friend, Russia, 
or his opponent, Germany. <br><br>

The proposal was duly made. In Rome and Paris it was accepted, 
although the Italians said that they did not feel it would be proper 
to bnng any pressure to bear on their allies, Austria and Germany. 
In Paris, with Poincare and Viviani still absent at sea, a good deal of 
confusion was produced by the Acting Premier's inexperience and 
uncertainty. He was trying to reassure the Germans about his peaceful 
intentions-reassurances that gave rise to quite misleading impressions 
about French policy in Berlin. The British proposal was in 
time referred to the absent leaders, who immediately accepted it. <br><br>

But in Russia, Grey's proposal met with an odd fate. Sazonov's 
attitude had changed during the course of the past day. For one 
thing, he had gotten over his temper. For another, he was surprised 
and relieved to learn, on Sunday morning, that the Austro-Serbian 
break had not been accompanied, as he had feared, by an immediate 
invasion. He was inclined now to think that a solution might be 
found and that the Serbian reply might serve as the basis for negotiations. 
This more cooperative frame of mind was greatly enhanced 
by an interview that took place that morning with the German 
Ambassador, Count Pourtalès, when they happened to meet on the 
platform of a suburban railroad station. The tactful Pourtalès took 
advantage of the Foreign Minister's more equable mood; in response 
to assurances about Russia's eagerness to avoid trouble, he 
urged the desirability of friendly conversation with Austria-Hungary. 
Sazonov was willing. That evening a remarkably friendly 
discussion did indeed take place between him and the Austro-Hungarian 
Ambassador, Count Szápáry. Szápáry did not know 
exactly what was happening at home; otherwise, he might not have 
gotten on so well. As it was, he explained in great detail that 
Austria's purpose was purely one of self-preservation and that 
nobody in the Monarchy had the slightest desire to damage Russia's 
interests. <br><br>

Sazonov visibly melted. He was much assuaged by the assurance <b>(p.238)</b> 
that Austria-Hungary would under no circumstance annex any
Serbian territory. He told Szápáry how exasperating the Russians
themselves had been finding the Serbs, with their terrorism and
their ambitions, and he suggested that the Serbian reply be used as
a basis for negotiation and that perhaps the whole question might
be submitted for mediation to the King of England. Szápáry was
not authorized to make, or accept, any definite proposals, but the
meeting was so encouraging that Sazonov told London that he
thought that the proposal for a conference should be postponed
while Russia continued direct conversations with Austria-Hungary.
In Berlin, a less favorable reaction was encountered by the
British. The British Ambassador was told on Monday that the suggested
conference would involve summoning Austria-Hungary
before “a European court of justice,” and that this could not be
permitted. Renewed hopes of “localization” were expressed. And
hope, too, was placed in the “direct conversations” between Russia
and Austria, which had now been reported by Pourtalès.<br><br>

The situation in Berlin, where anti-Russian and anti-Serbian
street demonstrations were beginning, was complicated by the
absence of the top men. The Emperor did not return from his yachting
trip until Monday afternoon. Of the military and naval authorities,
Moltke reached the capital from his spa Sunday night and
Tirpitz Monday noon. Meanwhile, the conduct of affairs continued
in the hands of Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and Secretary of
Foreign Affairs Jagow.<br><br>

Their policy seems to have been a consistent application of principles
laid down in early July. Most historians have thought they
were consistently backing strong Austrian measures, and many think
that they were urging Austria to invade Serbia as soon as a Serbian
rejection of the ultimatum was received. There is documentary
evidence for this: on Saturday, before the time limit had expired or
the Serbian reply been made, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador in
Berlin, Szogyeny, had wired his government: “Here every delay in
the beginning of war operations is regarded as signifying the danger
that foreign powers might interfere. We are urgently advised to <b>(p.239)</b> 
proceed without delay and to place before the world a <i>fait accompli</i>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a><br><br>

Szögyény's telegram is definite; and it is not only perfectly
harmonious with what is known of German attitudes at the beginning
of July but it is confirmed by telegrams to and from Tschirschky,
the German Ambassador at Vienna. This German attitude of
urging a speedy <i>fait accompli</i> is further confirmed by the extreme
casualness with which the text of the Serbian reply was treated; it
was available from the Serbian Legation, but nobody apparently
bothered to read it for several days-apparently the Germans were
not interested in knowing anything except that it was “negative"
and had led to the breaking of diplomatic relations. It is further confirmed
by the perfunctory reception of Grey's proposals for FourPower
mediation and, later, Four-Power ambassadors' conference,
as well as mild British suggestions that a moderating influence
should be exerted by the Germans at Vienna. These were hastily
dismissed by Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow, and while Berchtold
was informed of the second proposal, it was not suggested by the
Germans that he ought to consider accepting it.<br><br>

The presiding authorities no doubt thought that they were taking
a line previously agreed. It is known, too, that they were also beguiled
by misjudgments. The Italians were refusing suggestions
from London that they exert influence on Austria and Germany. The
French, represented by an Acting Prime Minister nervously equivocating
and muttering soothing words to the German Ambassador at
Paris about the peaceful intentions of France, were quite erroneously
viewed as unwilling to become involved on behalf of their angry
ally, Russia. Things were not to change in this respect until Wednesday,
when Poincare and Viviani finally got home. And as regards
London, serious misunderstandings persisted. The Ambassador,
Prince Lichnowsky, was stern in his reports about the chances of
Britain's remaining neutral in case of war. But his telegrams of
warning were disregarded. He was suspected of Anglophilia and
was discounted as a Cassandra: as early as July r8 he had told
his government that “localization” lay in “the realm of pious <b>(p.240)</b> 
wishes. There were, moreover, conflicting and encouraging reports
from other quarters. A conversation on July 24 between Winston
Churchill and the influential German shipping magnate, Albert
Ballin, left the latter with the impression that Britain would fight
only if Germany tried to “swallow up” France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> Later the King of
Great Britain, on Sunday afternoon, had a conversation with his
cousin Prince Henry of Prussia, the Emperor William's brother,
who happened to be visiting England, which left the Prussian
Prince with a similar impression: the King was understood to have
said he hoped that England would remain neutral if a Continental
war broke out.<br><br>

It is probable that Ballin misunderstood Churchill, and it is
certain that nothing King George might say would have any
importance in the making of British policy, but the two statements
had the effect in Berlin of contradicting Lichnowsky's gloomy
warnings, consolidating the impression caused by the recent improvement
in British-German relations, and emphasizing Grey's
steadfast refusal to say anything that might hint in any way, shape,
or form at Britain's future policy.<br><br>

The result of these misjudgments was to fortify the “pious wish"
that Russia would be left unsupported if it tried to make trouble and
that the diplomatic situation was favorable for Austria. Whether or
not there was a firm policy of urging the Austrians to quick military
action, the confused impression that obtained in Berlin suggested
that prudence demanded speedy and decisive action.<br><br>

It must be kept in mind-what is obvious but easy to overlookthat
nobody in Berlin knew what was going to happen. The mistaken
optimism about Italy, France, and England enveloped them;
and the situation in Vienna was still unclarified. As far as the men in
Berlin knew anything about it, they believed that hostilities were
being scheduled by the Austrians for August 12, the date officially
determined in Vienna on Saturday, July 25, a delay that understandably
seemed dangerous to them. Moltke, reaching Berlin Sunday
night, wrote on Monday, “The situation continues to be extremely <b>(p.241)</b> 
obscure ... It will be about another fortnight before anything
definite can be known or said.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a><br><br>

The Emperor reached Berlin on Monday afternoon, having interrupted
his yachting trip against the advice of Bethmann-Hollweg.
He arrived in a characteristic rage. Everything that had happened in
the past couple of days had been exasperating. Bethmann-Hollweg
had been giving him advice-not to return from his cruise, not to
order the navy back to its bases-which the Monarch regarded as
both impertinent and unwise. He had been, he thought, insufficiently
supplied with information. Bethmann-Hollweg was trying
to keep him calm and prevent him from interfering. By the time he
got back, most of the important decisions had been taken.<br><br>

The most important of all was taken in Vienna. Instead of
delaying a declaration of war until August I 2, when they would be
able to begin fighting, the Austrians suddenly decided to issue ;ton
Tuesday, July 28, and so informed the Germans late Monday afternoon,
when William II was trying to catch up on accumulated
papers. He did not, for example, read the text of the Serbian reply
until Tuesday, nor was he, apparently, informed of the latest proposal
for mediation from Sir Edward Grey.<br><br>

The reasons for the change of mind in Vienna have been the subject
for much debate. There are two principal theories: One, that
Berchtold and Conrad were alarmed by the reactions of Europe, and
especially Russia, and began to fear pressure from other quarters
that would oblige them to negotiate instead of carrying out their
private war. Second, that they were persuaded by BethmannHollweg
and Jagow (before the Emperor returned) that Austria
must present the world with a <i>fait accompli</i>. There is not much
direct evidence for the first theory, and as noted above there is a
good deal for the second. It is also quite likely, though there is no
real evidence, that Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow were deliberately
trying to keep the Emperor William ignorant of what they were
doing, both before and immediately after his return to Berlin. It is
plausible enough; anyone trying to pursue a consistent policy would <b>(p.242)</b> 
certainly have wished to prevent his meddling; he was maddeningly
fickle and trivial. There is good reason to believe that the Emperor
had told them that It would be impolitic to disregard or decline
further proposals from Great Britain for mediation and that they
<i>pretended</i> both to their own sovereign and to the German Ambassador
in London that they were willing to cooperate with Sir Edward
while simultaneously and furtively urging the Austrians to
declare war as soon as possible.<br><br>

By that afternoon, Sir Edward had read the Serbian reply and
felt that It met all reasonable demands the Austrians might have. He
therefore insisted to Lichnowsky that England must now take an
active interest in the matter, and pressed a new proposal for
mterventwn. Lichnowsky so informed Berlin, adding his own exhortation
in favor of accepting Sir Edward's suggestion. BethmannHollweg
replied that Germany <i>did</i> accept.<br><br>

Uon the terms with which tllis latest English proposal on the
evemng of Monday, July 27, was forwarded to Vienna, hinges the
controversy about Jagow's and Bethman-Hollweg's sinister behav~
or. The chief evidence for their wickedness arid duplicity is
agam a telegram from Ambassador Szögyény in Berlin to his own
government in Vienna which was sent at nine-fifteen Monday night.
In it he said that Jagow had emphatically disassociated himself from
the English proposals and had passed them on merely to avoid
irritating Sir Edward Grey. Jagow, Szögyény said, could not himself
support the English proposals, “because the conflict with Servia was
a question of <i>prestige</i> for the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which
Germany shares to some extent.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Jagow was reported as not in the
slightest degree favoring consideration being given to Sir Edward's
proposal; but he thought it very important that England should not
side with Russia. There is supporting evidence from other sources
that this was a true reflection of the line that Jagow was taking.<br><br>

The principal defense for Jagow and Bethmann-Hollweg in this
connection rests upon the assertion that Szögyény misunderstood.
He was, to be sure, an old man, whose retirement had already been <b>(p.243)</b> 
ordered. Jagow himself later claimed that he often thought
Szögyény was unclear in his understanding. But there is no real
evidence of confusion in this case. And the conversation as he reported
it was, in many ways, natural enough. Bethmann-Hollweg
and Jagow had for some days been executing a policy aimed at a
<i>fait accompli</i> by Austria-Hungary. It coincided with previous German
policy, defined in early July, to the effect that (a) strong
measures were necessary to preserve the Habsburg Monarchy; (b)
the quicker such measures were taken, the better; (c) the Austrians
were notoriously given to backing down at the last moment, and
needed stiffening. To these had been added, during the period when
the Emperor was on his yacht and the military chiefs occupied with
their mineral waters, the additional considerations (d) once the
ultimatum had been presented and diplomatic relations broken,
Austrian inaction became more and more a sign of weakness and
an invitation to meddling by Europe, and (e) the moment seemed
opportune for frustrating Russian intervention by the reluctance
of the rest of Europe to start a general war for which, in any case,
Germany was well prepared.<br><br>

But the theory that they resolutely and deceitfully egged the
Austrians on does not-and so far as the telegram about Grey's
proposals goes, cannot-mean that they were responsible for the
change of date for the declaration of war. <i>The decision had been
taken earlier</i>. If German influence was decisive, it was influence
exerted before Szögyény's telegram arrived. On Sunday, Berchtold
had summoned Conrad (according to the latter's memoirs) and told
him that, regardless of when military operations could actually
begin, an immediate declaration of war was expedient, and by
Monday afternoon the necessary arrangements had been made. The
telegram giving notice of the decision reached Berlin a little after
4:30P.M., some five hours before Szögyény's was sent.<br><br>

The influence of Bethmann and Jagow, previously exerted, may
have been important. But other influences had been at work in
Vienna. Berchtold was himself receiving reassuring reports from
Szápáry, who was telling him all about his friendly interview with <b>(p.244)</b> 
Sazonov. At the same time they were hearing rumors about the
Period Preparatory to War--on Monday they had told Tschirschky
that they found them worrisome, and may have wanted to get
started on Serbia before the threat of complications led anybody to
put pressure on them. It probably did not require the Germans'
disclaimers to convince people in Vienna that Grey's proposals,
however embarrassing to reject, would lead to endless complications
if accepted. Both the Austrians and the Germans presumably apprehended
the danger that European negotiations of any sort
would bog down in the kind of compromise that would leave the
authority of the Habsburg Monarchy seriously damaged without
any compensating alleviation of the Serbian threat. That had
happened before; it could not be allowed to happen again. If the
Germans had not bothered to read the Serbian reply, the Austrians
had, and they knew that they were up against the danger that Europe
might believe the Serbs truly anxious to please. In fact, Sir Edward
Grey's reaction to the reply demonstrated precisely this; and an even
more stunning demonstration of it was to be forthcoming after
William II had had time to peruse the text. One might hazard the
suggestion that the cleverness of the Serbs, as well as the pressure
of the Germans and the threat of the Russians, was responsible for
the speed-up of the plans. As the Austrians began to understand
what its effect would be, the need for a <i>fait accompli</i> became urgent.
And Berchtold in Vienna, and Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow in
Berlin, now had reason to hope that “localization” was feasible. In
any case, the decision to advance the date for war was taken.<br><br>

In accordance with the plan agreed to on Monday, the Serbian
government was notified at noon on Tuesday, by telegram to Nish,
whither it had been removed, that a state of war existed between
Austria-Hungary and Serbia. It was stated in the telegram that
Serbian troops had attacked Austro-Hungarian forces at the border
town of Ternes-Kubin. This was the legal pretext for the declaration,
and it may have been used as a means of persuading the
Emperor Francis Joseph to agree to it. There <i>had</i> been a rather
anomalous incident at Ternes-Kubin, involving a boatload of Serbian
troops on the river, late Monday night, but it had nothing to do <b>(p.245)</b> 
with the decision to declare war, which, as far as Conrad and Berchtold
went, had been reached some hours before it took place.<br><br>

<i>The Powers Mobilize</i><br><br>

From the standpoint of the realities of power, the Austrian declaration
of war on Tuesday, July 28, changed nothing. The troops
of the Habsburg Monarchy were no more nearly ready to march than
they had been the day before. The interests of the Powers remained
what they had been. But in law and in attitudes the effect wa.s
revolutionary. For the first time in a generation a Great Power was
at war against another European state; making peace before hostilities
actually began would be extremely difficult, although not
everybody regarded it as impossible; and Russia and its friends
and allies were powerfully confirmed in their conviction that
Austria-Hungary and Germany were bent upon a course of invasion
and chastisement regardless of consequences. Whatever they might
do now, the Germans could not escape the odium for having done
nothing earlier to restrain their ally; and the failure to do something
seemed to many so grossly apparent and so appallingly irresponsible
as to suggest that it must have resulted not from misunderstanding
of the consequences but from ulterior motives to set Europe on fire.<br><br>

There was no intention deliberately to set Europe on fire in Berlin,
at least among the civilians who were still making decisions, or on
the part of the Emperor. The events that followed the Austrian
declaration of war demonstrated it. But these events could not be
made publicly known. Germany was committed to support AustriaHungary
and was perfectly willing to risk a general war, even
though many Germans were now alarmed by what was happening.
They could not, they thought, openly admit either their mistakes or
their willingness to run risks; they were, therefore, obliged to keep
their misgivings secret and, in the end, to accept a general war that
they had expected to avoid.<br><br>

The Emperor William II read the text of the Serbian reply on the
morning of Tuesday, July 28, before the declaration of war had
been dispatched and apparently before he had been told it had been <b>(p.246)</b> 
decided on. The effect on him of the Serbs' masterpiece was precisely
what it had been on Sir Edward Grey when he had read it
forty-eight hours earlier. In the margin William wrote in longhand
a frunous note: “This is more than one could have expected! A great
moral succes: for Vienna; but with it every reason for war drops
away, and Giesl might have remained quietly in Belgrade! On the
strength of this I should never have ordered mobilization.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> He
wrote at once in the same tenor to Jagow, saying that he thought
the Austnans ought to be congratulated on a brilliant success, that
no more cause for war existed, that the most the Austrians should
do would be to occupy Belgrade or other territory as a pledge for
executwn of the Serb promises, and that he himself would mediate
for peace on this basis.<br><br>

It is possible that the Emperor, having come upon the scene
without the background of Bethmann-Hollweg's and Jagow's optimistic
appraisal of the European situation, had a clearer understanding
of what Lichnowsky's admonitory reports from London
meant, what the French position really was, and what Italy's noncommittal
attitude toward its allies signified. As well as sharing, he
certainly understood the impact that the Serbian reply was having
throughout Europe. It is possible that if Bethmann-Hollweg had 
troubled to read it he, too, would have felt it prudent to try to restrain,
rather than to urge on, the Austrians.<br><br>

It is striking that Sir Edward Grey, on the same or the next day,
also devised a proposal almost identical to that of William II: that
the Austrians should occupy Belgrade as a pledge for the execution
of Serbian promises but should themselves agree to no further
military action. Moreover, the Italian government had just made a
similar suggestion, and it is conceivable that if the proposals had
c~me befMe Austria-Hungary declared war, they might have provided
a basis for negotiation. But the Emperor's proposal did not
leave Berlin until late on Tuesday, after the dispatch of the telegram
to Nish.<br><br>

From the moment he read the Serbian reply, the German Emperor
was anxious to settle the Austro-Serb dispute peacefully. His <b>(p.247)</b> 
motives are open to doubt-they may have been composed of
cowardice, of genuine concern about a general war, or of an understanding
that, as things were shaping up, Germany was going to
appear in a very unfavorable light before world opinion if one took
place. But no serious student any longer thinks that William II was
at this point anything but anxious to arrange a settlement, as long as
the basiC requirements of Austria-Hungary's security and prestige
could be safeguarded. About Bethmann-Hollweg's and Jagow's
aggressiveness on the other hand, there is almost equally general
agreement. Apparently, they had anticipated that William might
weaken, and were prepared to outmaneuver him. Albertini believes
that they were still, on the Tuesday and Wednesday, pursuing their
dup!icitous policy of unconditional backing for Austrian aggression
behmd the Emperor's back. Fay is convinced that they were becoming
extremely annoyed with Vienna for keeping them in the dark.
Irritation is well documented-"This duplicity of Austria's is
intolerable,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> Bethmann had written several days earlier-but it is
not necessarily a disproof of Albertini's theory that the Chancellor
and Jagow were still conspiring to secure a <i>fait accompli</i>. For that
there is an unexplained delay between the early morning on Tuesday,
when the Emperor William ordered Bethmann-Hollweg to
propose his pledge plan in Vienna, and the time when the telegram
was actually sent-ten-fifteen in the evening-after war had been
declared and the fact made known in Berlin.<br><br>

Bethmann-Hollweg approved, if he did not initiate, the next
effort by his sovereign to prevent trouble. Late on Tuesday night, a
telegrrun was drafted from William II to the Emperor Nicholas of
Russia (signed: “Your very sincere and devoted friend and cousin,
Willy") saying, among other protestations of friendship and eagerness
for peace, “I run exerting my utmost influence to induce the
Austrians to deal honestly and to arrive at a satisfactory understanding
with you.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> The wire was sent at one forty-five Wednesday
morning.<br><br>

By an odd coincidence, the mind of Nicholas II had turned in <b>(p.248)</b> 
similar directions. Three quarters of an hour earlier there had left
Saint Petersburg a telegram addressed to William II (signed:
Nicky) expressing outrage at the “<i>ignoble</i> war declared on a weak
country” and asking Willy “in the name of our old friendship ... to
<i>stop</i> your <i>allies</i> from <i>going too far</i>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a><br><br>

The Willy-Nicky telegrams-there were others to follow-had
little effect on the course of events, but they throw ·light on the
generalization, still heard among popular writers, that it was “the
autocratic monarchies of the East” who made the war, and that
dynasts are inherently bellicose. It was weakness, not autocracy, that
made the eastern empires bellicose, and it is clear that the dynasts in
Berlin and Saint Petersburg-and in Vienna, too, where Francis
Joseph had almost certainly balked at approving the declaration of
war-were less lighthearted about war in the final crisis than many
of their ministers and generals.<br><br>

The declaration of war and the reactions to it in other parts of
Europe at last made Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow perceive the
difficulties of their position as clearly as the Emperor did. Whatever
they may have been doing before, now-when it was too late and
<i>because of the event that made it too late</i>-they saw not only that
European “complications” were almost certain but that if they took
place the image of Germany was going to be very seriously tarnished.
The curious sense of leisure, hastening a <i>fait accompli</i> and
trying to prevent things from happening elsewhere, that had
characterized statecraft in Berlin up to the Emperor's return, disappeared
by Tuesday evening. By then Bethmann-Hollweg was
learning from the German Ambassador in London that the Austrian
Embassy there was freely saying that the ultimatum had been intended
to be unacceptable and that no amount of accommodation by
Serbia would have prevented war.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> The effect was apparently to
bring to a head Bethmann's accwnulating irritation with the
Austrian government. It may have been the fact that Vienna was not
keeping him informed of its intentions; it may have been fears for
the German image; it may have been concern for his personal
position or orders from his sovereign. Whatever the motives, he <b>(p.249)</b> 
dispatched to Tschirschky in Vienna the famous Telegram Number
323, sent from Berlin at ten-fifteen on Tuesday evening. It represented
a dramatic evolution of attitude toward Austria-Hungary.
In it, William II's pledge plan-that the Austro-Hungarian forces
should occupy Belgrade as a pledge for fulfillment of Serbian
promises-was conveyed:<br>

<blockquote>... the Austro-Hungarian Government has left us in the dark
concerning its intentions, despite repeated interrogations. The
reply of the Serbian Government to the Austrian ultimatum, which
has now been received, makes it clear that Serbia agreed to the
Austrian demands to so great an extent that, in the case of a completely
uncompromising attitude on the part of the AustroHungarian
Government, it will be necessary to reckon upon the
gradual defection from its cause of public opinion all over Europe.
... The Imperial [German] Government in consequence is placed
in the extraordinarily difficult position of finding itself exposed to
proposals for mediation and conferences from the other Cabinets,
and, if it persists in its previous reserve toward such proposals,
the odium of having caused a world war will fall on it even in the
eyes of the German people.</blockquote>

And he then proceeded to argue that Russia must be placed in the
position of blame for a possible widening of the conflict; the prevention
of war-and the placing of blame for it, should it break
out, on Russia- could best be achieved by the pledge plan, coupled
with renewed assurances that Austria-Hungary would abstain from
the annexation of Serbian territory.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a><br><br>

Both the accusers and the defenders of Germany have found
solace in Number 323. Clearly, it proves a belated effort to curb
Austrian impetuosity; also clearly, it proves that Bethmann-Hollweg
was much less worried about preventing war than about ascribing
blame for it to Russia. But these considerations are beside the point;
the Germans were faced with a real possibility of war now, and
Bethmann-Hollweg was reacting with perplexity, exasperation,
anxiety, and the perception of expediencies that he was-as it were
-being paid to perceive. He believed, apparently, that assurances <b>(p.250)</b> 
to Russia about Austria's territorial “disinterestedness” (the diplomatic
phrase was <i>désintéressement</i>; the French word is slightly more
categorical in suggestion) would suffice to deter Russia. If they did
not, if the pledge plan did not, if the first Willy telegram did not,
and if more plausible conduct by Austria did not-then the alternative
to war was a humiliating retreat by Austria. And that, as he had
earlier remarked, was impossible “unless it is willing to make the
.final sacrifice as a Great Power.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> The policy was perfectly consistent
with Germany's real needs.<br><br>

To say this is in no way to suggest that Bethmann-Hollweg and
Jagow were men either of integrity or of skill. They were almost
certainly duplicitous beyond the common requirements of diplomacy
or even expediency; and they were singularly inept in many of their
judgments. They seemed to have failed to understand that the
preservation of their only ally, Austria-Hungary, undoubtedly
necessary to German policy, was being pursued in foolish ways
<i>likely</i> to oblige Germany to fight most of Europe. This was not
driven home until, on Wednesday, they received from London a
warning clearly saying that Great Britain might not remain neutral
in case of war. It was foolish to gamble on the belief that Russia
might abstain from action; that Italy might, despite all indications,
prove loyal to its allies; that France might prove disloyal to its ally;
or that British neutrality could be counted on. But these were errors
in judgment; they were not associated with a plot to start a war.
As has been seen, and will soon be seen more clearly still, irresponsibility
was general throughout Europe. So general that the word
demands a restricted definition; it <i>must</i> be used to mean that irresponsibility
was a failure to imagine that a general war would
develop into a sort of historical phenomenon entirely unknown in
previous history. It was known, of course, that the war would be
general; but if it had been quick, as it was in 1870, then the actions
of Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow would seem perfectly orthodox,
although not very wise.<br><br>

By Wednesday, July 29, when the warning from London came,
there was consternation in Berlin. The dream of Europe's allowing <b>(p.251)</b> 
Austria-Hungary to chastise Serbia in peace was dispelled. Complications
were burgeoning on every side. As early as Sunday, rumors
of the Russian military plans had begun to reach Berlin; their effect
had been allayed by Pourtalès' accounts of his affable chats with
Sazonov, but after the declaration of war they emphasized the
gravity of the situation. On Monday, Conrad was urging on Berchtold
the need to ask for German mobilization if the rumors from
Russia were substantiated, and Berchtold had reported this, in
rather guarded terms, to Tschirschky, and asked that the Germans
warn the Russians against military steps that might threaten AustriaHungary.
When he learned of the declaration of war, German Chief
of Staff Moltke observed that an Austrian invasion of Serbia would
almost certainly lead to Russian military measures; that this prospect
meant that the Austrian intention of mobilizing only against Serbia
would be folly, since it would leave Austria exposed to Russian
attack; that the mobilization of both Austria and Russia would
inevitably lead to conflict between them; that conflict between
Austria and Russia would force Germany, under terms of its
alliance, to mobilize in Austria's defense; that since this was inevitable,
it had better be done before the Russians stole a march.
Q.E.D.: Germany ought to mobilize at once.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a><br><br>

The German Emperor, Chancellor, and Foreign Secretary were
by no means ready for such a drastic step. But Moltke's views
illustrate the ways in which military considerations, and military
leaders, began to bear upon policy, now that military steps had been
taken by Russia. The exigencies of defense, only indirectly influential
earlier, now were pressing considerations. Bethmann-Hollweg
was sufficiently impressed to send off rather threatening telegrams
to Russia and France, the former saying that “further continuation
of Russian mobilization measures would force us to mobilize, and
in that case a European war could scarcely be prevented.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> A sealed
envelope within a sealed envelope was sent to the German Legation
at Brussels by messenger. It contained an ultimatum, drawn up
three days earlier by the aggressive Moltke, demanding that German <b>(p.252)</b> 
troops be permitted to pass through Belgium. The German Minister
was to open it only on receipt of subsequent orders.<br><br>

On Wednesday afternoon and evening there was a series of
meetings at Potsdam between the Emperor and his advisers. There
was as yet no serious consideration of mobilizing; instead, a second
Willy telegram was sent to Nicholas II, friendly in language but
observing, “Of course, military measures on the part of Russia
which would be looked on by Austria as threatening would precipitate
a calamity we both wish to avoid.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> Bethmann-Hollweg
called in the British Ambassador and told him that he hoped that
Britain would remain neutral in case of war, and in return promised
that Germany would seek no acquisitions of French, Belgian, or
Dutch territory in Europe (overseas holdings were pointedly
omitted from the guarantee). This inept (and characteristic) offer
made the British more suspicious than ever. Grey called it infamous.
It was typical of the whole history of German diplomacy to seek
peace through threats and promises that revealed a voracious a~petite.
But Bethmann-Hollweg also continued to work for peace m
Vienna by securing Austrian agreement to the pledge plan. The
telegrams to Vienna became more urgent, and by midnight
Tschirschky was being instructed to convey the British warning to
Austria and, indeed virtually to <i>order</i> the Austro-Hungarian government
to accept the pledge plan. The Germans were now-as
Bethmann wired-"clutching at every straw.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a><br><br>

The following morning, Thursday, with still no reply to the
pledge plan received from Vienna (where Berchtold was saying the
whole thing would have to be considered by Franc1s Joseph and
Tisza) Bethmann telephoned to Tschirschky to apply still more
pressure, and William II wired Francis Joseph asking for an
immediate decision. At nine o'clock Thursday night, Bethmann sent
a final telegram, which read:<br>

<blockquote><b>(p.253)</b> If England's efforts succeed, while Vienna declines everything,
Vienna will be giving documentary evidence that it absolutely
wants a war, into which we shall be drawn, while Russia remains
free of responsibility. That would place us, in the eyes of our own
people, in an untenable position. Thus we can only urgently advise
that Austria accept the Grey proposal, which preserves her status
for her in every way. Your excellency will at once express yourself
most emphatically on this matter to Count Berchtold, perhaps also
to Count Tisza.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]<</a>/blockquote>

Two and a half hours later, Bethmann issued instructions to
Tschirschky to disregard it; Moltke, convinced by now that war
was certain and mobilization esstential, had persuaded him that
things had gone too far for a pledge plan to be safe. Moltke distrusted
the Schlieffen Plan, which required war against France and
the occupation of Belgium; but if Russia were to be fought, he had
no choice but to obey its imperatives. The requirements of defense
demanded that he insist on preparing for it. The time, he thought,
had passed when he dared postpone military measures.<br><br>

He was right. While the Germans were growing more and more
agitated during Wednesday and Thursday, and while Moltke was
pressing on the civilians (and on the Austrians) the inexorable
logic of the law of mobilizations, things had been happening in
Saint Petersburg that made diplomacy irrelevant.<br><br>

It will be recalled that the first reactions of Sazonov to the
Austrian ultimatum had been of fury and frustration and that he
had sponsored the plan of partial mobilization against the Austrians,
apparently partly in an effort to frighten or blackmail them. The
program had been strenuously opposed by the military on technical
grounds; but it had been provisionally adopted, to go into
effect when and if Austria-Hungary invaded Serbia. Pending that,
there was to be a Period Preparatory to War. Once these measures
had been decided, Sazonov' s anger had cooled, and the failure of
the Austrians to take any action following the Serbian rejection led <b>(p.254)</b> 
him to a more hopeful mood. He had chatted affably with both
the German and the Austrian ambassadors and had been prepared
to enter into direct “negotiations” with Vienna, although what the
subject of these negotiations might be had not been discussed.<br><br>

The Austrian declaration of war-the timing of which may have
been in part the consequence of the Russian military measuresrevived
in even more violent form his earlier agitation. He was
apparently convinced that both the Austrians and the Germans
had been deliberately misleading him with their amiable talk while
pursuing deep-laid plans for aggression; his state bordered on the
psychopathic. In any case, he decided that the time had come to
undertake partial mobilization, and as soon as he heard of the
declaration he informed the Russian embassies abroad that it would
be ordered. But here again the Russian generals intervened. The
arguments that had been advanced earlier about the extreme danger
of trying by improvisation to mobilize on one part of the frontier
and not the other were renewed. It was repeated by the chief of
staff, General Janushkevich, and the chief of mobilization, General
Dobrorolski, that the mobilization of a few districts would jeopardize
the success of a later general mobilization, should one become
necessary, as they (like Moltke) thought it would. These arguments
were presented to Sazonov and then to Nicholas II.<br><br>

They prevailed. Sazonov was already convinced that the Germans
were themselves prepared to fight. And it was-as it almost always
is-difficult for civilian leaders to resist the urgent advice of the
military, upon whose judgment must depend the safety of the
nation. On Wednesday morning, less than twenty-four hours
after the declaration of war on Serbia, the Russian Emperor reluctantly
agreed that general mobilization might be necessary; two
mobilization decrees were signed, one for partial and one for
general mobilization, to be used as circumstances might dictate.<br><br>

Meanwhile, Sazonov was hearing from the Austrian Ambassador
that the Habsburg Monarchy had turned down the proposal for
direct negotiations. He had already heard from the French Ambassador
(acting on his own authority and possibly even in <b>(p.255)</b> 
violation of instructions) that France was eager to support its ally. From
Pourtalès he was hearing Bethmann-Hollweg's threat that, unless
Russian military measures were called off, Germany would be
obliged to mobilize. And he was hearing the first news from the
front-of an Austrian bombardment of Belgrade. The news came
when Sazonov was conferring with the Austrian Ambassador; the
latter drily reported that from Sazonov's manner he judged further
negotiations would be fruitless.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a><br><br>

The combined effects of these developments was to convince
Sazonov of the necessity of general mobilization in the face of what
he now deemed to be a certain European war. But while his resolution
was being thus fortified, his sovereign tergiversated: Nicholas
at first approved and then, a few hours later, revoked an order for
general mobilization. It may have been the second Willy telegram
that produced this shilly-shallying, or merely the natural tendency
of Nicholas toward vacillation and a pacific solution. In any event,
at nine-thirty Wednesday night, when Bethmann-Hollweg was busy
trying to bring pressure to bear on Vienna to desist from its secretive
and provocative policies and to accept the pledge plan, Nicholas II
told his frantic generals to cancel the general mobilization and
order partial mobilization instead.<br><br>

There was thus a possibility, late Wednesday night, that German
and Russian restraint might work. Partial mobilization was thought
by most people in Berlin to be compatible with a peaceful solution
-that is, it did not actually require German mobilization in reply.
If Austria-Hungary were to accept the pledge plan, then the British
would bring pressure to bear upon Russia to accept it too. Pourtalès
worked mightily to convert Sazonov. He reiterated the Austrian
promise that there would be no annexation of Serbian territory,
and he reported-what was not true-that Germany was putting
pressure on Vienna to accept the pledge plan. But Sazonov remained
unconverted; he wanted absolute promises that Serbian sovereignty
as well as Serbian territory would be respected. On Thursday
morning, he told the German Ambassador that the only basis on <b>(p.256)</b> 
which peace could be secured was the elimination from the Austrian
demands on Serbia of those points that were incompatible with its
sovereignty. On the other hand, he did not actually insist that
Austria ref rain from all hostilities against Serbia. There seemed
to Pourtalès a bare chance that the pledge plan might work.<br><br>

But Sazonov was deceiving Pourtalès about the chances of negotiation.
Russian policy was no longer in his hands. It had passed
to the military, once agreement had been reached that some kind
of military measures should be taken. Just as Moltke in Berlin was
freely telling his own government and Austria's what the military
requirements were, so the Russian generals now, on Thursday morning,
determinedly renewed their campaign to prevent partial mobilization
and to assure general mobilization, which they and everyone
else knew would mean war with Germany. Sazonov was convinced;
with his. support, Janushkevich telephoned the Emperor at his
suburban palace begging him to abandon partial mobilization. The
Emperor refused. But he agreed to have a conference to discuss the
matter with Sazonov, and this took place at two o'clock on the afternoon
of Thursday, July 30. The Emperor was worried about his
moral responsibility for “the thousands and thousands of men who
will be sent to their deaths” (Russian casualties in the war were
to be about ten million men, including some two million dead) .
Sazonov was speaking now for the generals: Partial mobilization
meant endangering the defense of the Empire. He presented their
argument; it was essential “to do everything necessary to meet war
fully armed and under conditions most favorable for us. Therefore
it is better without fear to call forth a war by our preparations for it,
and to continue. these preparations carefully, rather than out of
fear to give an inducement of war and to be taken unawares.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a><br><br>

The Russian generals were probably right: consider the massive
effort necesary to mobilize; consider the dangers of uncovering
part of their frontier by mobilizing against Austria alone; consider
the long background of fear and suspicion and the undoubted evidence
of Austria-Hungary's determination to reduce Serbia; <b>(p.257)</b> con-
sider Germany's granite support of its ally; then their conclusions
seem plausible and persuasive. They appear to have misled Nicholas
into thinking that Austria was already mobilizing against Russia,
which was not true; but it does not change the fact that from a
purely military standpoint their reasoning was sound. And so, for
all his instability, was Sazonov's basic political reasoning: Austria-Hungary
intended to destroy the independence of Serbia; this would
seriously affect Russia's interests, and it could be stopped only by
war. In any case, the Emperor Nicholas II was persuaded. Late on
Thursday afternoon, Sazonov triumphantly telephoned the chief of
staff with the news. “Now you can smash your telephone. Give
your orders, General,” he said. At five in the afternoon, the orders
were given to the telegraph operators. In the early hours of Friday,
July 31, the red posters proclaiming general mobilization were
going up on the walls of every town in Russia. Nicholas II wrote
in his diary: “After lunch I received Sazonov and Tatischev. I went
for a walk by myself. The weather was hot ... had a delightful
bathe in the sea.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a><br><br>

In Austria-Hungary, too, final decisions were being made that
Thursday. The Habsburg Monarchy had embarked, with German
support and advice, upon the course of a <i>fait accompli</i>. Now they
intransigeantly declined to turn back. They had given Russia the
promise of “territorial disinterestedness,” but they would not go
further. They were at last decided, and they were determined not
to negotiate, as all the other Powers including Germany believed
they could and should, on the basis of the Serbian reply. They
declined the proposals of “direction conversations” with Russia,
although they pretended a readiness to renew them. They declined
to listen to the German proposals for the pledge plan-which they
may well have thought were motivated mainly by a desire to keep
the British quiet. When Tschirschky delivered the substance of
Telegram Number 323, with its admonitions and its support for
the plan, they merely observed that they would have to think the
whole thing over. 

<b>(p.258)</b> There was little time to do so. By Wednesday night, Vienna had
been officially informed of the Russian intention to begin partial
mobilization. They at once informed the Germans that, if this intention
was carried out, Austria-Hungary would be compelled to
supersede its own mobilization measures, so far directed only against
Serbia and not involving the eastern frontier, with general mobilization.
This was logical enough; they now had little choice. They
acted before it was absolutely necessary-that is, before they knew
that the Russians actually carried out their intention. This may have
been the consequence of nerves in Austria-Hungary; it would not
be surprising. Or it may have been that they were alarmed by signs
of a drastic change in German attitudes-Bethmann's frantic telegrams
were beginning to arrive in Vienna on Thursday morningand
wished to act before the Germans could withdraw their guarantee
of support. In this they may have been aided by Tschirschky,
who seemed to have been halfhearted in executing his government's
new policy. In any case, Austria-Hungary now acted to present a
<i>fait accompli</i> not to its opponents but to its ally .. Conrad wrote to
Moltke asking him to urge that the Germans, too, mobilize as soon
as possible. And on Thursday afternoon, at exactly the moment
when Sazonov was convincing the Emperor of Russia that the fatal
order <i>must</i> be given, Berchtold and Conrad were convincing the
Emperor of Austria that the corresponding order was necessary.
Agreement was in both cases procured; in Austria, there was further
characteristic delay and confusion; Tisza's agreement also had to
be procured. But when news of the Russians' general mobilization
came through on Friday, the Austrians at once proclaimed theirs.<br><br>

In France and England, the military were also beginning to appear
on the scene. On Wednesday, Poincare and Viviani at last
reached Paris after their long sea voyage. The situation was ebullient.
There were patriotic demonstrations in the streets, and cries of
”<i>Á Berlin</i>,” The chief of staff, General Joseph Jacques Joffre, had
already urged on Russia the need to be in a position to attack quickly
should war break out; now it was decided to give Russia further
assurances of French support, to seek a commitment of British <b>(p.259)</b> 
support for the Entente, and to take precautionary defense measures,
At the Cabinet meeting Thursday morning, the Minister of War
urged the necessity to begin at least inconspicuous military preparations,
the manning of the frontier defenses or <i>couverture</i> (blanketing),
as it was called. The French were extremely cautious about
anything that might appear provocative, probably because they
wished to be quite sure that the British should see them as an innocent
victim when the worst took place. Informed of Russian military
measures, they urged similar caution upon their ally, although
Paleologue, who was apparently deliberately deceiving his own
government, was simultaneously failing to deliver Viviani's cautious
advice to the Russians. They avoided the calling up of reservists
for the present, and they ostentatiously announced that troops
were to be moved back six miles from the German border to avoid
incident. But at the insistence of Joffre the <i>couverture</i> began at once.<br><br>

In London, as usual throughout the crisis, refined and highminded
confusion prevailed. But the First Lord of the Admiralty,
Winston Churchill, the most resolute of the ministers, had given
orders that the fleet should not be dispersed following its summer
maneuvers. Then, on Tuesday afternoon, after word of the declaration
of war reached London, Churchill gave further orders: the fleet
was to proceed to its battle bases and be prepared for action.
The naval measure was important, for it meant that Great
Britain would be in a position to fulfill its one definite commitment:
to cover the Channel ports of France against German naval action
in the case of war. But no one was as yet prepared to go beyond
that commitment, and Grey's diplomatic efforts were still directed
at a general conciliation. He was still of the opinion that by “working
with Germany"-that notion in one form or another appeared
in many of his dispatches and conversations-it would be possible
to provide a satisfactory basis for negotiation. But he was now prepared,
after the declaration of war, to issue a muted warning to
Germany, and this he did to Ambassador Lichnowsky on the morning
of Wednesday, January 29. With diplomatic obliquity, Grey
told the Ambassador: “if we failed in our efforts to keep the <b>(p.260)</b> 
peace ... I did not want to be open to any reproach from him that
the friendly tone of all our conversations had misled him or his
Government into supposing that we should not take action.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a><br><br>

The warning had its effect in Germany, though not the one intended:
"England reveals herself in her true colors at a moment
when she thinks we are caught in the toils and ... disposed of,"
William II remarked. “That common crew ot shopkeepers has
tried to trick us.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> But it was not enough to arrest the gigantic
forces already working toward mobilization in Europe. Nor was it
intended to be; Grey still believed that any stronger stand on behalf
of the Entente would meet with violent opposition in Cabinet and
Parliament and might cause the collapse of the ministry. Sir Arthur
Nicolson and Sir Eyre Crowe, the ranking members of the Foreign
Office, were urging a definite stand; from the beginning, they had
shown a clearer grasp of realities than had any other European
statesmen. But they were civil servants and not politicians, and the
Foreign Minister was acutely aware of the extreme reluctance of
most of Britain to participate in an Eastern European dispute.<br><br>

There was one point of real concern, however, on which most
people in Great Britain would unite, and that was the integrity of
Belgium. On Friday, Grey accordingly asked both the Germans and
the French for assurances that they would, whatever happened,
respect the neutrality of Belgium. The French immediately responded
in a satisfactory way; the Germans declined to commit
themselves on the grounds that a definite guarantee would reveal
their military plans. Sir Edward now reached the conclusion that
general war was certain, that the Germans were probably designing
the violation of Belgium, and that Britain would be obliged to go
to war. But the Cabinet was still deeply divided; not until after
Belgian territory had been invaded, and not until after several
members of the Cabinet had resigned, was there to be the possibility
of agreement on a foreign policy for Great Britain.<br><br>

While these distressing uncertainties were driving British statesmen
up the wall, events were moving rapidly in Central Europe. By <b>(p.261)</b> 
Friday morning, reports of the Russian general mobilization were
reaching Berlin. Moltke, now as desperate as Janushkevich had been
the day before, was frenziedly urging military action before the
Russian preparations could proceed further, and on his own responsibility
was telling Conrad that it was indispensable that Austria
commence general mobilization to prepare for a defense
against Russian attack. He sent a telegram to this effect to Vienna
early Friday morning. There, read in conjunction with Bethmann's
messages urging caution, it gave rise to confusion about who was
directing German policy and what that policy was. It has since
become a showpiece for those who believe that Moltke was the
chief villain of the drama. But it is certain that his admonitions
reached Vienna when general mobilization was already under consideration
and almost certainly after the decision had already been
made. The Emperor William and the Chancellor declined to take
action until there was official confirmation of the Russian proclamation,
and it is possible that their refusal was what incited Moltke to
take the initiative.<br><br>

Official news reached Berlin, about noon on Friday, from
Pourtalès. By now Serbia, Austria, Russia, France, and even Great
Britain had begun military measures of one sort or another; Germany
alone among the Powers concerned had not yet done so.
Time was pressing; at noon the Germans proclaimed a State of
Danger of War, a measure rather similar to that the Russians had
undertaken six days before. At three-thirty in the afternoon was
dispatched what has been called the Double Ultimatum. Russia
was told, “Mobilization must follow ... in case Russia does not
suspend every war measure against Austria-Hungary and ourselves
within twelve hours and make us a distinct declaration to that
effect.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> To the German Ambassador at Paris went a more complicated
ultimatum: within eighteen hours, the French were to say
whether or not they intended to remain neutral in a GermanRussian
war. It was secretly added that if the French said they were,
then pledges of good behavior were to be demanded in the form of <b>(p.262)</b> 
German occupation of French frontier fortresses. The occasion for
making this demand never arose; but since there was not the
slightest possibility of its being accepted, it may be taken as final
evidence that the Germans were determined, if they fought at all,
to fight both France and Russia. Their strategic situation made the
existence of a powerful and temporarily neutral France intolerable;
their strategic planning absolutely required a war on both fronts.<br><br>

The time limit on the ultimatum to Russia expired on the afternoon
of Saturday, August I. No answers had been received from
either Paris or Saint Petersburg, and at five o'clock the order went
out for German mobilization. At six, Pourtalès saw Sazonov; he
asked three times if the German demands could not be met. Each
time Sazonov replied no. Pourtalès handed him the text of the
German declaration of war against Russia and then broke into tears.<br><br>

<i>Europe at War</i><br><br>

The rest was formality, preordained by the terms of alliances
and of military plans. When the news of the German State of Danger
of War reached Paris, General Joffre had demanded the calling
up of reservists. After receiving and disregarding the German ultimatum,
France had ordered general mobilization at three fortyfive
on the afternoon of Saturday, August I, two hours before the
Germans had declared war on Russia. At seven in the evening
0n Sunday, the German Minister at Brussels handed the ultimatum
to the Belgians in accordance with previous instructions. Twelve
hours later the Belgian rejection had been delivered; the Germans
declared war on France that day, and on the following morning
invaded Belgium. The British sent an ultimatum of their own to
Germany demanding assurances that German forces be withdrawn.
The reply was unsatisfactory, and at the expiry of the time limit,
midnight on the night of Tuesday, August 4, Germany and Great
Britain were also at war.<br><br>

The course of events that led to this general war are perfectly
clear, though the motives and in some cases the timing are not. <b>(p.262)</b> 
Austria-Hungary, at the urging of its ally, Germany, undertook
strong measures against Serbia in order to protect its existence and
its position as a Great Power. The exact purpose of these measures
was not clearly agreed upon in Vienna, but they were of a sort to
convince the Russians that Austria intended to extinguish Serbian
sovereignty and to establish Austro-German predominance in the
Balkans. To prevent this, and perhaps to frighten Austria into a
more reasonable frame of mind, the Russians adopted military
measures. The Germans felt absolutely obliged to stand by their
ally, and they believed, from the moment of the assassination, that
the safest course of action for Austria-Hungary to adopt would be
a quick, decisive one, a <i>fait accompli</i>. They were prepared to incur
the risk of fighting Russia, although they believed that it could be
avoided. They urged-fruitlessly, most of the time-speed and
decision in Vienna, and they continued to urge it after the Russian
reaction to the ultimatum had showed that the risks were very
serious. The Austrians responded by speeding up the declaration
of war against Serbia; the Russians reacted, according to schedule,
by mobilizing. Military considerations made it expedient that their
mobilization be general, and this constituted a direct threat to
Germany that could be met only by German mobilization. The
French felt absolutely obliged to stand by <i>their</i> ally; it would
almost certainly have been impossible for them to abstain from
participation if they had wanted to, since the Germans almost certainly
would have attacked them anyway as part of their plan for
war against Russia. But the French did not consider abstention;
instead, they gave the Russians unchanging, and sometimes provocative,
assurances of their loyalty. German mobilization meant French
mobilization, and German war against Russia meant a war between
France and Germany. And since war between France and Germany
involved the German violation of Belgium, it meant, too, war between
Germany and Great Britain.<br><br>

In this summary of events, stripped of the fruitless proposals for
negotiation, may be discerned several elementary facts.<br><br>

First, the vital interests of Germany and of France required <b>(p.264)</b> 
loyalty to their respective allies; betrayal, or even a suggestion of
weakness, would have incurred charges of treachery and led to a
vulnerable and invidious isolation in a dangerous world. <i>The
strength of their allies was part-an essential part-of their own
strength and safety</i>;- the preservation of that strength was deemed
to demand not only loyal support but assistance in executing the
policy of the ally. Prestige was part of strength; the Germans feared,
rightly, a diminution of Austro-Hungarian authority; the French
feared a diminution of Russian authority. Neither believed that
the two were wholly incompatible, but they had very different
views as to the minimum requirements of their allies' needs.<br><br>

Second, the safety of each Power depended upon the execution,
within very narrow time limits, of a very complicated and unalter·
able military plan. Not only could the plans not be changed; they
must be put into effect as rapidly as possible to prevent grave military
disadvantage, once the threat of war became serious.<br><br>

Third, the Russians were absolutely convinced that Austria had
sinister plans in the Balkans seriously menacing to their own interests,
and they were convinced that the sovereignty of Serbia, however
much of a nuisance they thought that nation might be, was
indispensable to their own security and dignity.<br><br>

Fourth, the Austrians were convinced that the sovereignty of
Serbia was a serious and permanent threat to their own existence.<br><br>

Fifth, the irretrievable steps were military measures, and these
were taken in most cases at the urgent behest of the chiefs of staff
and their advisers. The generals appear in a very unfavorable light
in most narratives of events. There is no doubt that some of them
-most conspicuously, Conrad-inclined to rabid bellicosity. But
none of them acted except when ordered by civilian ministers.
And the advice of most of them, of Janushkevich, of Moltke, of
Joffre, was given as a matter of duty when facts drove them, correctly,
to the conclusion that they could not safeguard their countries
without preparing for war. This had nothing to do with their
views as to whether war was or was not wise. They, like the min;
sters they advised, were merely performing their necessary <b>(p.265)</b> 
function. As Winston Churchill was to say some twenty years later,
"The responsibility of ministers for the public safety is absolute
and needs no mandate.”<br><br>

But this is not to suggest that the course of events was preordained
or that nothing could have been done to prevent its developing
as it did. There are hundreds of suppositious changes that might
have prevented the war from taking place when it did and on the
terms it did. To discuss them is profitless, but to suggest a few
possibilities, chosen at random, may be instructive.<br><br>

For one thing, the French Ambassador at Saint Petersburg,
Maurice Paleologue, repeatedly pressed on Sazonov the need for
a “firm policy.” His position was very influential-both because
he represented Russia's ally and because, since his chiefs were
inaccessible, it was necessary for him to act on his own responsibility.
He was, for a time, making French policy toward Russia,
and the policy he made was incitement to war. A different 
ambassador might well have altered the course of events. Paleologue
went far beyond the terms of the alliance, beyond the need to show
diplomatic solidarity, beyond the limits of previous French policy.
His actions and influences offer a precise counterpart to those of
Tschirschky in Vienna.<br><br>

To take another example, it has frequently been said by both
sides that a clearer stand by Sir Edward Grey would have saved
the peace. If the Germans had been told, early and with conviction,
that Britain would take part in the war, they would very probably
have averted instead of encouraging the Austrian ultimatum and
declaration of war. There is strong evidence for this; some Ger·
mans have even taken the weird moral stand that Grey was responsible
for starting the war because if he had made his position
clear the Germans would never have permitted it to start. The
ethics of this attitude are not convincing, but the facts are. A less
fastidious, conciliatory, and correct statesman might have acted
more effectively. A modest measure of duplicity, such as many
diplomats regard as a proper tool of their trade, would have permitted
him to make much stronger representations much sooner <b>(p.266)</b> 
than he did. No absolute commitment was necessary; he could
have told both Lichnowsky and his own Ambassador at Berlin
that Great Britain <i>did</i> regard the Austro-Serbian problem as of
European and British concern (that would have been a matter of
judgment, not of propriety) and that if war broke out Great Britain
would almost certainly take part in it on the allied side. This would
have been tricky, in both senses of the word, but experienced
diplomats of the utmost rectitude like Nicolson and Eyre Crowe
were urging something like it. Sir Edward suffered from an excess
of scruples and perhaps an insufficiency of grasp; his case is a
demonstration for the argument that there is at times nothing so
dangerous as pacific punctilio.<br><br>

If either Sazanov or Berchtold had behaved differently, on any
of several occasibns, the course of events would certainly have been
different. A less volatile and more judicious statesman than
Sazonov, and one surer of his own ground, might not have reacted
with so much emotion and so little regard for political realities
as he did on hearing of the Austrian ultimatum. A smaller concern
for Russia's prestige and his own might have prevented his urging
the Serbs to reject the ultimatum, and it might have delayed the
Period Preparatory to War and given time for fruitful negotiation.
A less indecisive statesman than Berchtold, and one with a
clearer vision of the future, might have formulated concrete demands
for Serbia that would secure Austria's ends without leaving
so much scope for uncertainty, even apparently in his own mind,
about what really was intended as an objective. The problem of
Austria-Hungary was in some ways comparable to that of Great
Britain: there were too many disagreements and cross-currents and
deterrents to clear-cut action. But a different sort of statesman in
either country might have overcome them and produced a definite
and rapid solution to the difficulties.<br><br>

Most important, there were in Germany many occasions when
different events would have followed if even slightly different decisions
had been made. At all times the Germans treated the prospective
war as if it were a rather inviting prospect. From July 5 on, <b>(p.267)</b> 
the Germans behaved unwisely in regard to Austria; they first
pressed for decisive action and, when it was not forthcoming, continued
to press for it without regard to changing circumstances.
They seem to have been wildly optimistic about the chances of
French and British pressure being exerted at Saint Petersburg.
They were certainly wildly irresponsible in acting on the belief
that they could win a European war if one broke out. Such unwisdom
was an understandable but not a necessary component of
German policy. If the German leaders had not been widely dispersed
around the middle of July, if the Emperor had returned a
few days earlier from his cruise, if Bethmann-Hollweg and Jagow
had not been caught up in the established policy that a <i>fait accompli</i>
was possible, Austria-Hungary might not have rejected out of
hand the Serbian reply, might not have broken diplomatic relations
with Serbia, might not have declared war, might not have provoked
the Russian mobilization.<br><br>

All these involve reproaches to the statesmen for deficiencies
in their stature. But the basic reproach must be the failure of imagination;
the statesmen were thinking of the defense of visible
interests that seemed vital; they failed to discern that invisible
and much larger interests were involved in their decisions. There
were, in Russia, those who foresaw a threat to the regime in the
war, but the defense of the regime seemed to Sazonov and the
Emperor Nicholas to demand not peace but prestige. No one, let
it be said again, realized that the war they were consciously risking
would be the first World War.<br><br>

Two things happened to turn war into cataclysm. First, the
breakdown of the German strategy in France and the establishment
of stable lines in early September, 1914: instead of a decision
there was an indecision, made perennial by the peculiar equilibrium
of military technology. Second, the accumulated tensions and conflicts
of the European State System, long repressed or stabilized,
all broke out the moment that war was a fact; the war could not
be ended until they were resolved. Most of these tensions had
nothing to do with the events that caused the war to break out; <b>(p.268)</b> 
they were buried at the bottom of the rivalries and the institutions
that made it possible. There was Alsace-Lorraine: once a FrancoGerman
war had started, France could not make peace until AlsaceLorraine
was restored, except after a military disaster; without a
military disaster, Germany would never concede the loss of the
provinces. There was the Anglo-German naval rivalry: once war
had started, Great Britain would not make peace until the threat
of a strong German Navy had been permanently dispersed. There
was Constantinople: once war broke out, the Russian government
could not make peace until it was assured that the centuries-old
ambition for Constantinople would be satisfied. There was Germany's
encirclement: once war broke out, Germany could not, short
of military disaster, make peace until the encirclement had been
broken, which meant the decisive crushing of both France and
Russia.<br><br>

These needs and ambitions had underlaid the tensions of Europe
and had shaped the alliance system and the policies of the Powers.
But they none of them had led to actions that produced war. They
were either negotiable or repressible. The one problem that was
neither negotiable nor repressible was that raised by threats to the
integrity of Austria-Hungary. The composition of the Habsburg
Monarchy made it fatally vulnerable to the activities of the Serbs;
at the same time, it made it difficult to eliminate those activities
by rapid and resolute action; and it made it difficult for the government
of Austria-Hungary--or its ally, Germany-to retreat,
to equivocate, to delay, once the decision to take action had been
made, ill defined and unsatisfactory as the decision was. It was this
problem that caused the war which became the first World War.<br><br>
