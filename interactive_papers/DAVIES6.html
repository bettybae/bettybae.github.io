	<p><b>[PAGE 77]</p><p>Evaluation</p><p>Issues and themes</b></p><p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the subject of the Occupation still provokes historians and unnerves ordinary French people. In one sense the wartime period is just a dusty historical era; in another, it is radically different. It is different because the period has the power to perplex and haunt. It is very easy to say that an historical period is still ‘alive’ half a century and more afterwards, but if ever an era deserved and warranted such an epithet, it is this one.</p><p>In Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 we explored the Occupation, the Vichy regime and collaboration, the Resistance and the Liberation as if they were routine historical topics. This of course is not the case. ‘Occupation’ is a term with striking overtones, even 60 years on. The Occupation of 1940–44 was not the first time that France had experienced—and suffered—foreign invasion and subjugation. As such, the modern-day French national psyche is extremely sensitive to the notion—<i>any</i> notion—of foreign occupation. This is reflected in, for example, Le Pen’s constant depiction of the contemporary immigrant influx as an ‘invasion’ and ‘occupation’. The FN leader knows that this language will strike a chord with ordinary French people.</p><p>Likewise, the term ‘Vichy’ still has a particularly powerful resonance in contemporary political debate: it can stir up all kinds of horrible memories for people, it can signify political betrayal and dishonesty, and it can conjure up images of a weak, humiliated and fallen nation. The town of Vichy is still fighting hard to rid itself of an unpleasant stigma.</p><p>The word ‘resistance’ also has a mesmeric effect—but in a positive, and not a negative, way. Even though, as we have discovered, the Resistance ‘myth’—devised and peddled by de Gaulle—has been demolished, the phenomenon of anti-German, anti-Vichy political activity still excites people. Today, not only are memories of the Resistance represented in veterans’ associations and in an array of potent commemorations and anniversaries, but in general terms there is an undimmed magic associated with the word.</p><p>It may be argued that France is still in <i>the midst of</i> liberation. The feeling exists that France, six decades on, is still confronting and still dealing with her demons. There is still introspection and embarrassment where the war years are concerned, and still a tendency to wallow in self-pity and shame. Today, amid war trials and wartime revelations, and with coy references to the occupied period still fashionable, the Liberation does not appear to have come to a final close. France may now be at the heart of the European Union—in tandem with the ‘new’ Germany—but in reality the wartime period still conditions the mindset of twenty-first century France.</p><p>Several key points and themes need highlighting. First, if the wartime years meant anything they meant division. Most obviously, there was division and friction between resisters and collaborators—a fundamental divergence in outlook. This confrontation evolved into civil war and what some commentators call ‘<i>la guerre franco-française</i>’: a confrontation between those who believed in liberation and an independent, unoccupied France and those whose vision of the future was dominated by the notion of a new Hitlerdominated Europe. Other divisions also emerged: between rich and poor and between haves and have nots; between peasants and town-dwellers and between southerners and northerners; between the working class and the upper class and between younger generations and older generations. So the German-constructed demarcation line split France in two—not just in geographical terms, but in social, economic and political terms as well. These divisions served to create a nation disabled by friction.</p><p>Second, life in occupied France was about choices. For individuals, families and organisations, there were crucial and life-affecting choices to be made constantly. To remain in the occupied zone—or not? To join the exodus to the free zone—or not? To resist—or not? To collaborate—or not? These were profound moral and ethical dilemmas. Not for nothing, therefore, is Sweets’ study of France under the Occupation entitled <i>Choices in Vichy France</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> The fact of the matter was that throughout the Occupation, French people had decisions to make —fundamental decisions that would affect the essence of their lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Third, was the Occupation period an end or a beginning? The simple answer is that it was both. The Fall of France marked the death of the Third Republic and the birth of the new (but also old) Pétain regime and the ultra-traditionalist project that was the National Revolution. In time, the Occupation years would witness the collapse and eclipse of Vichy, the Liberation, and the dawn of a new era in the form of de Gaulle’s provisional government and the Fourth Republic. In this respect, therefore, the wartime period was a watershed: an end, but also a beginning.</p><p>With hindsight it is now no longer satisfactory to depict the Occupation as merely a confrontation between ‘the good’ (the resisters) and ‘the bad’ (the Germans and the collaborators). What this study of occupied France has shown is that there were many varieties of response. ‘Passive collaboration’ and ‘passive resistance’, for instance: these are complex matters that defy easy categorisation and go to prove that the wartime era was a period in which individual Frenchmen and women were forced to make crucial and life-affecting choices. If there was something heroic and idealistic about resistance and the decision to resist, there was something dark and sinister—and perhaps also understandable—about collaboration and the decision to collaborate.</p><p>The men who personified these two stark options were once colleagues and friends, but ended up as rivals and antagonists.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> Some might say that Pétain and de Gaulle both addressed the ultimate challenge of freeing France. Pétain certainly saw himself as the ‘shield’ protecting France, while de Gaulle represented the ‘sword’ which would fight for, and then consolidate, national freedom. In some senses, the two men led parallel lives; in others they were two men with extremely different political projects.</p><p>The irony of course is that de Gaulle, after piloting France towards liberation, not only became disillusioned with post-war political arrangements in France but also, during and after his presidency, became deeply unpopular. The Marshal meanwhile slid into captivity, oblivion and then death. He always retained a small band of devoted, ultranostalgic admirers, but for the majority of people his name became synonymous with high-level betrayal and cowardice.</p><p>Today, the many statues and commemorative plaques that grace the villages, towns <b>[PAGE 79]</b> and cities of France are potent reminders of the heroism of resistance, the hopes and expectations that went alongside liberation, and the awfulness and terror of the Holocaust.</p><p>But it is the statues and commemorative plaques which have not been erected that tell the real story. Visitors to the town of Vichy should not expect to see an official memorial to Pétain or Laval.<b>[PAGE 80]</b>
