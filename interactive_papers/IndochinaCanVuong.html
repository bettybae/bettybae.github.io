case 22: $("div#commentary").html('A year after the French besieged Hanoi and while they were annexing northern Vietnam, King Tu duc died in Hue, having reigned for more than thirty-five years. The succession tot he throne was a difficult matter. Tu duc had left no offspring but had picked an heir who did not have the good fortune of pleasing the regents. Successoral intrigues consequently developed among court officials. In the midst of their plots the French attacked Thuan an, a little port off Hue, and then proceeded to a siege of the royal capital itself. The consequence of the ensuing turmoil was that in just one year (from the death of King Tu duc on July 17, 1883 to the accession to the throne of King Ham nghi on August 1, 1884) four kings succeeded each other on the throne of Vietnam. Three of them died violent deaths because either their personalities or their policies on the questions of war and peace discountenanced now one, now the other of the regents. The fourth, King Ham nghi, a boy of twelve, inherited from his predecessor the Patenôtre treaty provided the legal basis for all Franco-Vietnamese relations after 1884 until its displacement by the Ho Chi Minh-Sainteny convention of March 6, 1946. The French militarists were proven right. A strike at the center of Vietnamese authority bore more fruit than a piecemeal annexation of northern Vietnam could have yielded. Yet, the pacification remained to be accomplished, and among the high officials of the court there were those who were determined to oppose French influence.<br><br>Regent Ton That Thuyet was one of them. With the tacit consent of King Ham nghi, he made the military preparations necessary to surprise and expel the French from the capital and eventually from the whole country. On July 3, 1885, French General de Courcy arrived in Hue with full military and civilian powers to act as the de facto first résident supérieur in Annam. Ton That Thuyet gathered his troops into the royal citadel where, during the night between July 5 and 6, he struck at the French troops. His coup failed.<br><br>The Regent and King Ham nghi were forced to flee from Hue toward the northern parts of the highlands in central Vietnam. In the meantime, the second regent, Nguyen Van Tuong, surrendered to the French and with the help of the Empress Dowager, King Tu duc’s mother, replaced Ham nghi with another member of the royal family. King Ham nghi’s flight from the royal city, and in particular the edict he issued to the people from exile, triggered a series of responses from the Vietnamese population. The responses came to be known as the Can vuong or Royalist movement, a movement which was to outlive King Ham nghi’s arrest in 1888 and persist up to the end of the 19th century.<br><br>'); break;
case 30: $("div#commentary").html('In southern Vietnam, there had been Ton Tho Tuong and Phan Van Tri. In northern Vietnam, there were Hoang Cao Khai and Phan Dinh Phung. The former advocated outright cooperation with France because of the impossibility of resisting her superior might and in the hope that Vietnam might be modernized under French guidance. The latter, on the contrary, were convinced that France could not help their country in any way. The only consequences of a relationship with France that they could envisage were the loss of Vietnam’s independence, suffering for the Vietnamese people, and humiliation for the king.<br><br>Phan Dinh Phung was the moving force of the Royalist movement which came to life with King Ham nghi’s edict. His history is a paradigm of loyalty and determination to follow the righteous cause. Dismissed and imprisoned by Regent Ton That Thyet over the succesion to King Tu duc while he was a high official at the court, Phan Dinh Phung nevertheless committed himself to the resistance movement of which the same regent was the principal leader. The French arrested his brother, excavated his parents’ tombs - but nothing could deter him from his struggle. He maintained, throughout his life, a firm confidence in the indestructible destiny of his country. The case of Phan Dinh Phung was typical of many other officials and members of the scholar class who had been educated and who lived in the purest Confucian tradition. It was obvious to them that they should oppose any foreign invasion which transgressed upon the sovereignty of their King. At no time did they try to justify their struggle, for it was evident to them that they were fighting the right battle.Neither did they ask whether it would be feasible or even rational to resist the superior forces of the French. Their King needed them, and they simply responded.<br><br>In the letter which follows, however, Phan Dinh Phung appears weary of the struggle and pessimistic concerning its outcome. The impression one receives is that he was bound by circumstances and would simply not abandon his followers.<br><br>As for Hoang Cao Khai, he too typified a large group, but one which belonged to another category. It was the category of those who never let slip a chance to build their fortunes or secure their careers. Hoang Cao Khai was a Confucian degree-holder also, hence a member of the scholar class and an official of the Vietnamese court. But he gained more success and became a more powerful administrator under the French, who approved his appointment as viceroy of Tonkin from 1888 to 1892 (at which time the office was eliminated). The French found in him an invaluable collaborator whenever they needed to crush the partisans. Hoang Cao Khai, in return, enjoyed their full confidence, as he proudly indicates in his letter.<br><br>'); break;

<center><b>Lanh Co, “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">Summons to Fight the French</a>” (ca. 1883) </b></center><br><br>

The provincial citadel<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> has been lost, and it becomes increasingly painful for us to receive the orders.<br><br>
The garrisons have been withdrawn and the imperial edicts reach us in bitterness.<br><br>
The French plots are indeed fearful. They are like silkworms gnawing at mulberry leaves.<br><br>
Luong Van Dat<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> was a God-cursed traitor who acted like a worm in one’s bones. He delivered the citadel to the enemy.<br><br>
Because of that, the situation now is almost desperate and the country disintegrates.<br><br>
Because the court’s officials were cowards and excessively anxious to save their lives, they hurriedly surrendered to the enemy.<br><br>
Given that advantage, the enemy now moves freely and kills our people with impunity.<br><br>
But people like us must try to preserve the country in which we live. Shall we just stare passively at our decay?<br><br>
We possess our life but we must know how to give it up. Shall we remain silent and thereby earn the reputation of cowards?<br><br>
As long as there exist people on this earth, we shall exist.<br><br>
As long as there is water, we must bail it out.<br><br>
We must read the Proclamation on the victory over the Wu.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a><br><br>
We shall follow the example of those who exterminated the Mongols.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a><br><br>
We shall gather the wind into a storm. We shall contribute to the resistance movement with our rice and money.<br><br>
We shall plant many trees to have a forest. We shall wield our sticks and our kitchen knives.<br><br>
Since we are determined not to live with the enemy, we shall not be deterred by their overwhelmingly superior forces.<br><br>
Since we believe that success rests upon the people’s will, we shall not fret over our futile efforts.<br><br>
Do you remember the battles at Co dang and Van mong?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> There, when one man died, another took his place.<br><br>
Bear in mind the words of Tong Lenh and Dong Vien.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> All shall sing their praise.<br><br>
The people must always be our fundamental concern and we should not exploit the situation to enrich ourselves.<br><br>
We must exert ourselves daily to increase our strength. We ought also to be very careful and realistic.<br><br>
Those who sold their country to the foreigner or injured their own race shall have their bodies torn to pieces.<br><br>
On the contrary, to those who share our ideals and hatred we shall offer our unremitting assistance.<br><br>
It was because they were isolated from the main forces that Doc Khoat and De Cong<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> were annihilated.<br><br>
Their examples should remind us that unity alone guarantees success.<br><br>
Such as the pattern of the battles at the Pine Forest and the Giat Bridge.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a><br><br>
These words arise from the depths of my heart.<br><br>
They express my most profound aspirations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a><br><br>

<center><b>King Ham Nghi (reigned 1884-1885), “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">The Royal Edict on Resistance</a>” (1885)</b></center><br><br>

The Emperor proclaims:<br><br>

From time immemorial, in the planning of military strategy there have never been more than three alternatives: to fight, to resist, and to negotiate. 
We have missed the chance to fight. To resist, we hardly hope for the necessary strength. To negotiate, we should never be capable 
of meeting the enemy’s demands. Therefore, we now find ourselves in a thousand difficulties, in ten thousand hardships. Unwillingly, 
we now resort to expedients. There have been numerous such cases among the famous men of antiquity: King T’ai<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[1]</a> moved to the 
mountains of Ch’i; T’ang Hsüan-tsung fled to Shu.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[2]</a><br><br>

Our country has recently experienced much suffering. Although I acceded to the throne at a very young age, I have always been
greatly concerned with the problem of strengthening and administering our nation. However, the pressure from the Western envoys 
became increasingly imperious each day. Recently, they even brought in additional troops and battleships. Their demands were 
then all the more difficult to satisfy. As usual, we received them cordially. But they were not disposed to accept anything.<br><br>

The people of the capital were keenly aware of the impending
danger. The great ministers of the court endeavored to construct a
policy that would maintain the country in peace and secure respect
for the national authonty. They were caught in a dilemma: ought
they bow their heads and receive orders from the enemy, to sit
quietly and let opportunities pass by, or ought they scrutinize the
enemy’s movements in preparation for an appropriate reaction?
Now, since we can no longer evade the course of events, we shall
have to build upon today’s gains for a better and brighter tomorrow,
Such is, after all, the necessity imposed by circumstances. All those
who have shared our anxieties surely appreciate the situation. If
they do not, let them join the resistance, grit their teeth, and, with
their hair on end, swear destruction to the very last enemy. Who
will not be moved by such a determination? Will there be no one to
make a pillow of his sword,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[3]</a> to beat his oars against the bark,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[4]</a> to
grasp the spears<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[5]</a> or to roll the jar?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[6]</a><br><br>

Moreover, the officials of the court should abide only by
righteousness. Knowing righteousness, they should live and die by
it. Ku Yuan<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[7]</a> and Chao Tsui<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[8]</a> of the Chin dynasty, Kuo Tzu-i<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[9]</a> and
Li Kuang-pil<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[10]</a> of the T’ang dynasty were indeed persons who lived 
by it in antiquity.<br><br>

My virtue is as gossamer; now that I am confronted with these 
changes, I am unable to take the lead. The capital has been lost.
The Imperial carriage has departed. I am responsible for all this, 
and I feel an infinite shame. However, since we are still bound by 
moral obligations, none of you - mandarins, ministers, literati, 
high or low - shall abandon me. Those with intelligence shall 
contribute ideas; those with strength shall lend their force. The rich 
shall give money to buy military supplies. The peasants and villagers
shall not refuse hardship or evade danger. It is right that 
this should be so.<br><br>

To uphold the weak, to support the faltering, to confront 
difficulties and reduce danger, none shall spare their efforts. Perhaps 
with Heaven’s assitance, we shall be able to turn chaos into
order, danger into peace, and finally retrieve our entire territory.
Under these circumstances, the fate of the nation must be the fate
of the people. Together we shall work out our destiny and together
we shall rest. Is this not the best solution? <br><br>

On the contrary , should you fear death more than you feel
loyalty to your King, should your domestic worries override
your concern for the affairs of state, should officials flee danger
on every occasion and soldiers desert their ranks to hide;
again, should the people withhold righteous assistance to the State
in this time of danger, and scholars shun prominent positions for
obscurity, would they not then be superfluous in this world? You
might wear robes and headdresses, but your attitude would be
that of animals. Who can accept such behavior?<br><br>

The court has always had its tradition of generous rewards
and heavy penalties. Act to avoid remorse in the future.<br><br>

“<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">To Surrender or Not to Surrender</a>” (ca. 1886)</b></center><br><br>

<b>(p.122)</b>

LETTER OF HOANG CAO KHAI TO PHAN DINH PHUNG<br><br>

Soon, it will be seventeen years since we ventured upon different
paths of life. Although matters have changed, the road from north
to south remains long and arduous.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3l">[l]</a> Nevertheless, in neither my
dreams nor my thoughts do I ever feel that you are far. How sweet
was our friendship when we both lived in our village.<br><br>

From the day on which you decided to take up arms against
the invasion your courage and loyalty have grown so renowned
that I have often heard the French administrators speak of you with
high regard. It is therefore clear that loyal men command respect
not only from their compatriots but also from persons of foreign
countries.<br><br>

At the time when the capital was lost and after the royal carriage 
had departed, you courageously answered the appeals of the 
King by raising the banner of rightenousness. It was certainly the 
only thing to do in those circumstances. No one will question that.<br><br>

But now the situation has changed and even those without intelligence 
or education have concluded that nothing remains to 
be saved. How is it that you, a man of vast understanding, do not 
realize this? But I seem to perceive your reasoning. You are <b>(p.123)</b> 
determined to do whatever you deem righteous. You give all your 
efforts and talents to the cause you consider just. And yet, although 
it is in a man’s power to undertake any enterprise, its outcome depends
upon the will of Heaven. All that matters indeed is the giving 
of one’s life to one’s country. No one therefore can deter you from 
your goal.<br><br>

The subject I should now like to introduce is the suffering imposed 
upon our country. It distresses me and has prompted me, on
several occasions, to write to you so as to discuss with you or at
least impart to you some of my superficial ideas. Each time, however,
I lacked the courage to complete my letter. Why? Because I
knew your determination too well and knew that my words would
certainly not induce you to change your mind. Moreover, the circumstances
in which we now live are so unlike that I doubted you
would want to understand my language.<br><br>

But recently, in an interview with the French governor-general,
we happened to discuss the situation in our province. Here are his
views. He knows quite well that you are committed to your righteous 
cause and that you are also utterly selfless. But though you
have no thoughts for your own person nor for your own family, you
should at least attend to the sufferings of the population of a whole
region. The governor mentioned this to me because he knew that I
was from the same province as you and that we might together devise
a plan to save it. His words are not worthless, and this is precisely
the reason why I can no longer remain silent.<br><br>

Are you not ashamed to see that the governor-general, who
comes from a foreign country severa1 thousand miles away, knows
how to care for our people while we, who were born and raised in 
this country, remain blind to the sufferings of its people? How
will they judge us, the generations a hundred years hence? I have 
always been taught that superior men should consider the care of 
the people as fundamental; who has ever heard of men who were 
loyal to their king but forgot the people’s aspirations?<br><br>

Until now, your actions have undoubtedly accorded with your 
loyalty. May I ask however what sin our people have committed 
to deserve so much hardship? I would understand your resistance,
did you involve but your family for the benefit of a large number!
AS of now, hundreds of families are subject to grief; how do you <b>(p.124)</b>
have the heart to fight on? I venture to predict that, should you
pursue your struggle, not only will the population of our village 
be destroyed but our entire country will be transformed into a sea 
of blood and a mountain of bones. It is my hope that men of your 
superior morality and honesty will pause a while to appraise the 
situation.<br><br>

I have meditated time and again upon my arguments and am
sincerely inclined to hope that you might willingly accept them.
But in your present situation, will you perhaps find it difficult to
bring your struggle to an end?<br><br>

Had I not been quite sure of being able to offer you security,
I should never have dared suggest a solution to you. But it happens
that the governor-general and I are good old friends. Furthermore,
the <i>résident supérieur</i> in Hue and the chiefs of Nghe an and Ha tinh
provinces also concur with my views. In addition to all this, I can
tell you that there have been cases in which I have been able to save
people in even direr circumstances. Recently, Mr. Pham Trong Mu’u
came to offer his surrender, and I personally presented him to various
French officials who treated him like a precious guest. They
immediately cabled the provincial authorities requesting them to
free his three sons and to permit him to attend to his ancestors’
tombs. This alone will prove to you the tolerance and generosity
of the government of the Protectorate. It will also prove to you
that, though they come from a foreign country several thousand
miles away, the French have the same heart and the same logic
we have.<br><br>

If you do not think my proposition completely senseless,
please: do not be concerned with anything else. I would never dare
commit  you to anything which would belittle you.<br><br>

REPLY OF PHAN DINH PHUNG<br><br>

In the last years, ever since the moment I gave my life to military 
affairs and went to live in the heart of the jungle, I have continually
experienced a heavy sorrow indeed, aggravated these days by the
cold of the winter season. Then all of a sudden, I was informed
that a letter had come from you. Upon hearing the news, my sorrow
and the cold weather marvelously dissipated as if into thin air, 
I read your missive at once.<br><br>

<b>(p.125)</b><br><br>

In your letter, you revealed to me the causes of calamties and 
of happiness. You showed me clearly where advantages and disadvantages 
lie. All of which sufficed to indicate that your anxious
concern was not only for my own security but also for the peace
and order of our entire region. I understood plainly your sincere
arguments.<br><br>

Although removed from each other by thousands of miles, I
feel as if we were sitting in the same house conversing calmly with
each other. The words which spring from the depths of your heart
receive my full consideration. But the nature of my situation and
my present feelings are difficult to express. When I pit the affairs
of the world against my own talent, the match reminds me of the
old saying, “Take the arm of the locust to halt the carriage” - and
my situation is even worse.<br><br>

Now, upon reflection, I have concluded that if our country
has survived these past thousand years when its territory was not
large, its army not strong, its wealth not great, it was because the
relationships between king and subjects, fathers and children, have
always been regulated by the five moral obligations. In the past,
the Han, the Sung, the Yuan, the Ming time and again dreamt of
annexing our country and of dividing it up into prefectures and
districts within the Chinese administrative system. But never were
they able to realize their dream. Ah! if even China, which shares a
common border with our territory, and is a thousand times more
powerful than Vietnam, could not rely upon her strength to swallow 
us, it was surely because the destiny of our country had been willed
by Heaven itself. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the Classics 
and of the Rites upon which we base our behavior was thereby
demonstrated.<br><br>


The French, separated from our country until the present day
by I do not know how many thousand miles, have crossed the 
oceans to come to our country. Wherever they came, they acted 
like  a storm, so much so that the Emperor had to flee. The whole
country was cast into disorder. Our rivers and our mountains have 
been annexed by them at a stroke and turned into a foreign territory.
These events affected the whole country, the entire population.
It is not any particular region or any particular family alone 
that has suffered this trial.<br><br>

<b>(p.126)</b><br><br>

In the year I Yu [1885] the Imperial carriage arrived at Son 
phong, in the provinces of Ha tinh. At that time I was mourning the 
death of my mother. I remained secluded in my house in order to
fulfil my filial duties. It did not occur to me to envisage anything 
else. However, since I belonged to a prominent family, the Emperor, 
two or three times, issued edicts summoning me. I could do nothing then 
but obey the Imperial orders. In addition, the Emperor has recently 
granted me a great honor in investing me with a major mission and in 
conferring upon me liberal powers. Were you in my place, could you 
refuse or escape these responsibilities?<br><br>

Ten years have elapsed since the birth of our movement.
Among those who gave themselves to the cause of righteousness,
many have been imprisoned and many have been killed, but the 
determination of those who are left has never diminished. On the 
contrary, they continue to sustain me with all their efforts and 
the number of these courageous persons increases daily. They did 
not abandon their families to tread my path because they found 
pleasure in adventure and danger. They simply trusted me, they 
had confidence in me; because of my determination, they could 
endure all these hardships without a murmur. Such is the people’s 
disposition. Were you in my place, could you abandon all these 
men without a pain in your heart?<br><br>

Dear old friend, it was because these people regarded me so 
highly that I was willing to leave my ancestors’ altars without incense 
and to see my relatives scattered in every direction around 
the country. If this is my attitude toward those who are my relatives, 
what then is my feeling toward those with whom I have no ties? 
If I am not even able to protect htose who are close to me, 
what then am I for those who are far from me? <br><br>

Moreover, if our region has suffered to such an extent, it was
not only from the misfortunes of war. You must realize that
wherever the French go, there flock around them groups of petty
men who offer plans and tricks to gain the enemy’s confidence.
These persons create every kind of enmity: they incriminate innocent
persons, blaming one one day, punishing another the next.
They use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their
possessions. That is how hundreds of misdeeds, thousands of
offenses have been perpetrated. How can the French not be <b>(p.127)</b> 
aware of all the suffering that the rural populatio had to 
endure? Under these circumstances, is it surprising that families
should be disrupted and the people scattered?<br><br>

You and I are from the same province of Hoan<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[2]</a> but we are
now removed from each other by several thousand miles. In spite
of this distance, you still care for the place of your birth. How much
then do I, who suffer this situation with my own body and witness
it with my own eyes? The difficulty is that I am bound by circumstances.
I must accept my destiny. I am only sad that I have not
the power to effect that which I will. What else can I do?<br><br>

My friend, if you are troubled about our people, then I advise
you to place yourself in my position and to think about the
circumstances in which I live. You will understand naturally and
see clearly that I do not need to add anything else.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[3]</a><br><br>
