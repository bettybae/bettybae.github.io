<br><br>The Ottoman Empire
<br><br>Mustafa Aksakal
<br><br>Abstract
<br><br>This chapter investigates the revolutions in the social and political organization of the Ottoman imperial domains – the Balkans and today’s “Middle East” – from the 1908 Young Turk Revolution to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, although this transformation cannot be considered to have ended then, or to have ever been completed. The instability that marked this period was replaced by equally unstable regimes, and its aftershocks have continued to define the region. The great number of casualties, displaced people, and forced migrations produced long-term socioeconomic consequences: urban populations did not return to pre-war levels until the early 1950s.
<br><br>‘A Less Abrupt and Unfortunate End’
<br><br>Was the Ottoman Empire in its final decade ‘a largely successful experiment in multi-nationalism that was destroyed by the great powers in World War I’?1 Or was it a failing state, one that took out loans it could not repay, oppressed its subjects, violated its non-Muslim populations, and stoked their desire for independence, thereby precipitating Great Power intervention and paving the empire’s road to destruction? Or, as has been argued, had the Ottoman Empire, ‘like the other multi-national, multi-religious empires’, simply ‘become an anachronism’, an empire whose leaders embraced ‘the inevitable’ and decided ‘to abandon the idea of empire and settle for a national republic’?2 Perhaps, as has also been suggested, the empire’s demise from 1850 on was an ‘unavoidable failure’ because of its comparative industrial disadvantage, its relatively small population (and hence military manpower), prized geostrategic location, and its multi-ethnicity in an age when political legitimacy depended on appeals to nationalism.3 Halide Edib, the Ottoman novelist, feminist thinker, government official, and military officer, writing in 1928, reflected on the Ottomans’ end, in terms that only hinted at the human catastrophe that had taken place:
<br><br>[In October 1918,] I was conscious that the Ottoman Empire had fallen with a crash, and that it was not only the responsible Unionist leaders who were buried beneath the crushing weight of it. Though disintegration had begun nearly a century before, and though I firmly believe that, war or no war, the empire would have been doomed anyhow, yet with the aid of a far-sighted policy, there might have resulted a less abrupt and unfortunate end. But at that the absolute finality of the death of the empire was an unavoidable fact.4
<br><br><b>(p.18)</b> The answers to all these questions depend on the sources one interrogates. Listening to largely European diplomatic accounts, historians might reach the conclusion that it was the empire’s own mismanagement that assured its end. When Ottoman sources are privileged, a different picture tends to emerge, one in which the empire appears as a ‘Victim of European Imperialism’, always groaning under the predatory practices of the European Great Powers that sought its partition, in a game known as the ‘Eastern Question’, ever since Catherine the Great set her eyes on ‘Tsargrad’ (that is, Constantinople/Istanbul) and Napoleon Bonaparte declared that whoever possesses Constantinople could govern the world.
<br><br>These opposite views of the empire were held by contemporary observers throughout the nineteenth century down to the First World War, and they have shaped assessments by historians since. This chapter is not the place to resolve this dichotomy, but I raise the issue here because it is implicit to any interpretation of the empire’s final years. It should be noted briefly that neither the ‘Ottoman failed state’ nor the ‘Victim of European Imperialism’ paradigm can explain the empire’s end. Even before the onset of European imperialism, between 1760 and 1830 the empire experienced a period of ‘do-or-die’ existence.5 The appearance of ethnic nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, moreover, cannot be attributed to European intrigue alone; nationalism and the trend towards the nation state were global phenomena and not unique to the Ottoman Empire.6 It is also beyond question, however, that European intervention on behalf of the empire’s Christian populations politicized Muslim–Christian relations across the Ottoman lands in ways that fuelled ethnic and religious violence.
<br><br>This chapter traces the empire’s main developments without taking its final demise in 1923 as a foregone conclusion. It treats the empire’s leaders and its peoples as actors on their own stage, operating under the conditions of war and, after 1915, total war. This chapter, in Halide Edib’s Words, is about the empire’s ‘abrupt and unfortunate end’.
<br><br>A Curious Event that Happened on the Way to Tarsus
<br><br>As Archduke Franz Ferdinand prepared to visit Sarajevo in late June 1914, an unusual incident put the people of Tarsus, an Ottoman town over a thousand miles to the east, near Adana, into panic mode. Gendarmerie headquarters there had received a delivery of sealed mail from the imperial government in Istanbul. The accompanying instruction said the mailbag should be opened only at the time of mobilization. But the bag had been unfastened nonetheless, revealing mobilization orders to be sent to all surrounding villages. Not surprisingly, the inadvertent news <b>(p.19)</b> flash unleashed confusion and rumours of impending conscription and war.7 Why did Istanbul take measures for mobilization in late June 1914, days <i>before</i> a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb slayed the Habsburg archduke and his wife, and <i>before</i> it became apparent that the couple’s murder would result in war between Austria–Hungary and Serbia, and perhaps a general, worldwide war? Was the Ottoman state predisposed to war, as reflected in the Tarsus authorities’ premature announcement of the conscription orders? Or was this simply a bureaucratic lapse in a routine procedure to which no great significance should be ascribed?
<br><br>When Austria–Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914—and Germany on Russia, France, and Belgium within a week’s time—the Ottomans’ imperial foundations were still shaking from a series of major domestic and international crises, and three wars since 1911 alone. While the Ottoman dynasty survived until 1922, outlasting the ruling houses of the Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, and Romanovs, millions of the Ottoman peoples, mostly civilians, did not. The House of Osman had ruled the Ottoman domains since about 1299. It had first established itself in the northern and western parts of Anatolia, before moving into south-eastern Europe in the fourteenth century and conquering the eastern Arab lands in the first quarter of the sixteenth. At that point the Ottoman sultan also arrogated to himself the title of caliph, the pinnacle of the world’s Muslims. The last sultan of the House of Osman, Mehmed VI, was sent into exile in 1922, followed by the proclamation of the Turkish Republic on 29 October 1923—nine years to the day after the Ottoman Black Sea naval attack on Russia that thrust the empire into the world war. The caliphate was abolished in March 1924. Mehmed VI’s burial in Damascus, outside the borders of Ataturk’s republic, symbolized the new regime’s efforts at excising the Ottoman past from the new Turkey.
<br><br>The life story of Franz Ferdinand’s assassin, Gavrilo Princip, intertwined with the empire’s life story. Princip had been born in Ottoman Bosnia in 1894. He, and the organization for which he carried out the attack, <i>Young Bosnia</i>, was demanding Bosnia’s union with Serbia, a state that had gained its formal independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, but without Princip’s Bosnia. Instead, Bosnia, along with Herzegovina, had been first occupied in 1878, and then, in 1908, annexed, by the Habsburgs.
<br><br>The Ottoman Spring and The Wars of 1911–1913
<br><br>The Ottoman constitutional revolution of July 1908 resulted in empire-wide elections and the first parliament since 1878, ushering in a brief Ottoman spring. ‘The country at once sprang to life’, reported a young Russian correspondent in <i>Pravda</i>, Leon Trotsky, in December 1908.8 The 1908 ‘popular revolution from above’9 <b>(p.20)</b> initially looked a lot like a military coup, but the momentary opening demonstrated the potential of the empire’s political viability.10 Mass rallies and festivities celebrated the event. Deputies elected to the parliament represented the various parts of the empire. A multitude of new organizations, clubs, and newspapers advocated unity and conciliation among the empire’s ethnic groups (Ottomanism), and decentralization.11 According to Fırka-i İbad, an Ottomanist political party, ‘today the government of Turkey [<i>Türkiye hükümeti</i>] and the Ottoman nation consists of Turkish, Arab, Albanian, Kurdish, Armenian, Greek Orthodox [<i>Rum</i>], Jewish, Bulgarian, and other many different elements. All elements are in unity and alliance with each other.’12However, those who launched the coup and forced the proclamation of the constitution—the Committee of Union and Progress—showed little commitment to democratic politics. Large-scale ethnic violence in Adana and political assassinations, including those of journalists, belied the hopes of 1908. By 1911, popular support for the new government headed by the Committee of Union and Progress had waned rapidly, and parliamentary strength shifted towards the new Freedom and Entente Party.13
<br><br>In September of that year, Italy attacked and occupied Ottoman Tripoli in North Africa (Libya), with little cause other than a desire for empire, prompting protests against the injustice across Ottoman lands and beyond.14 To put down the ensuing local resistance, Italian authorities publicly hanged fourteen of the agitators. In Izmir, an emotional play decried the Italian attack and galvanized popular support.15 In the hope to attract European diplomatic backing, Ottoman politicians and scholars of international law pointed to the illegitimacy of the Italian action, without much success.16 A year later, in October 1912, while still at war with Italy, Istanbul faced yet another military crisis. A combined army of Bulgarian, Greek, Montenegrin, and Serbian troops seized the three Ottoman European provinces of Kosovo, Manastır, and Salonica, amidst great atrocities committed against civilians <b>(p.21)</b> by all sides.17 In July 1913, during the Second Balkan War, Ottoman troops retook Edirne/Adrianople, a former imperial capital, against the Great Powers’ strong admonition. But, despite Edirne’s recapture, the empire had now lost territory it had held since the fourteenth century. The empire was also losing its Christian population. Estimates of the Ottoman population put the total (excluding Egypt) for 1872 at around twenty-nine million, with just over half residing in the empire’s European territories. In 1872, almost one-half of the population was non-Muslim. By 1906, the population had shrunk to some twenty-one million, with non-Muslims accounting for roughly one-quarter of the total population.18
<br><br>For some the defeat in the Balkan Wars proved beyond doubt the disloyalty of the empire’s Christians. Christians had provided one-quarter of the Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War, and it was their performance that had caused defeat, some declared—and not the fact that the Ottoman armies faced vastly larger forces in most theatres.19 The former Ottoman governor of Salonica—a prominent Ottoman urban centre now also lost—published an open letter, claiming that the empire’s Orthodox Christians had not only failed in their military service but also refrained from joining the empire’s Muslims in making financial donations to support the war effort.20 Muslim-owned companies marketed their products in advertisements hostile towards non-Muslim subjects and businesses. After 1912 the designation ‘Ottoman’ in print advertisement stood ‘exclusively’ for ‘Muslim/Turkish’, as one author has argued.21 In the countryside, townsmen and villagers encountered yet another generation of refugees. They heard first hand the reports of ethnic cleansing from the survivors themselves (see Fig. 1). According to official Ottoman records, 297,918 Muslim refugees arrived in the empire from the Balkans by 1915, a number that possibly rose to as high as 640,000 by 1920.22
<br><br>The man atop the Ottoman military during the years of the First World War, War Minister Enver Pasha (1881–1922), cut his teeth in the guerrilla warfare of Libya and the bloody conflicts in the Balkans (and had been one of the revolutionary officers who overthrew Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1908–9). Enver (‘bey’ until January 1914, ‘pasha’ thereafter) and the men around him—many of whom themselves hailed from the Balkans—interpreted these conflicts as Christian <b>(p.22)</b> [Fig. 1. Refugees in Thrace, c.1915. The upheaveal of 1911–23 turned millions into refugees and displaced people.] aggression.23 All sides made use of religious language throughout these conflicts, with the Greek king, for example, claiming that his armies were fighting ‘the holy struggle of justice and freedom for the oppressed peoples of the Orient’.24
<br><br>These experiences of violence imbued Enver and large segments of society with a deep sense of victimhood.25 As one paper put it, ‘our honour and our people’s dignity cannot be preserved by those old books of international law, but only by war’.26Violence, the paper claimed, could be overcome only with even greater violence. Between January and June 1914 some 200,000 Orthodox Christians were expelled from Anatolia’s western coastal regions and Thrace.
<br><br>To others, such as the members of the liberal Freedom and Entente Party, or important figures such as Amir Shakib Arslan and Sati’ al-Husri (both of whom played leading roles in pan-Arab nationalism after the war), Ottomanism—the movement emphasizing coexistence of the Ottoman peoples of different religious and ethnic backgrounds within the imperial framework—continued to offer a viable path into the future.27 In fact, Shakib Arslan, in early 1915, led a unit of <b>(p.23)</b> Arab volunteers in support of Cemal Pasha’s First Suez Canal Campaign against British-held Egypt. For some, Ottomanism still appeared as a viable imperial framework throughout, and even after, the First World War, but after 1912–13 it remained marginal.28
<br><br>The notion that the empire’s multi-ethnicity—in an age of nationalism and European imperialism—threatened the Ottoman Empire’s very existence was, of course, not new in 1912. After the war with Russia in 1877–8, Sultan Abdülhamid II had declared it unacceptable that non-Muslims inhabited regions of strategic importance for the defence of the capital.29 By 1908, some leaders of the Committee of Union Progress had already decided that there should be ‘no nationalities’ in the empire, that the empire should not ‘become a new Austria’, referring to the 1867 <i>Ausgleich</i> that converted the Habsburg Empire into a dual monarchy and more recent reforms. Their goal was the creation of ‘a unified Turkish nation-state with Turkish schools, a Turkish administration, [and] a Turkish legal system’.30 However, even though the Committee of Union and Progress had successfully launched the Revolution of 1908, within a couple of years it had lost much of its support and held on to political power through coercion and rigged elections. The Italian and the Balkan wars put the Unionists back in the driver’s seat; without these wars, it is quite possible that the Committee of Union and Progress’s decline might have continued and that not their vision but that of others might have become policy. The convergence of traumatic defeat, militarist leadership, and the First World War, however, proved catastrophic.
<br><br>The Great War as Great Opportunity
<br><br>The Committee of Union and Progress turned the military crises of 1911–13 to its advantage. A mix of young military officers and civilians, the organization’s leaders believed in taking initiative. Influenced by an international discourse on the pseudo-science of Social Darwinism, the committee’s supporters advocated bold action. This had been displayed already, as we have seen, by Enver Bey and his men in the 1908 constitutional revolution, the armed resistance against Italy, and the Second Balkan War that brought the return of Edirne. In January 1913, moreover, military officers had stormed the offices of the grand vezir, killed the war minister, and toppled the cabinet, replacing it with one dominated by the Committee. The new cabinet, backed by officers trained by the German General Colmar von der Goltz, arranged for a German military mission to reform the army. Arriving in <b>(p.24)</b> Istanbul in December 1913, the German military mission joined British naval officers and French gendarmerie officers already employed in the empire. As military reform proceeded, the government also sought international cover in the form of a military alliance. Rebuffed when he sought an alliance with London in 1913, Grand Vezir Said Halim opened talks with Berlin. An alliance with Germany, Said Halim and Enver hoped, would provide military security against attacks such as those from Italy and the Balkan states, and provide necessary cover for domestic development and industrialization. Germany itself, and Japan, offered successful models for this vision of rapid ‘militarist modernization’.31
<br><br>A military alliance would also give Istanbul a stronger hand in any diplomatic negotiations, such as those involving the Great Powers’ demands for improving living conditions and personal security in the empire’s eastern Anatolian provinces, home to largely Armenian and Kurdish populations. Large segments of the press, moreover, supported the aggressive tone and activist policies of the Committee of Union and Progress. ‘Our entering the [First World] War was not the work of a single individual’, a prominent officer later recalled, ‘but the result of various complex factors’, especially ‘our press’ and ‘public opinion’.32
<br><br>It was only the conjuncture of the July crisis that induced Berlin to agree to the signing of a military alliance on 2 August 1914. For the Ottoman leaders, the alliance treaty, good for seven years, was a major diplomatic achievement. The defeat of Germany—and the total war whose threshold they had just entered—was difficult to fathom from the vantage point of 1914. Having demanded and received gold, men, and materiel from Germany, and determined to preserve the alliance even at the cost of war, the Ottoman navy struck at Russia across the Black Sea on 29 October 1914.
<br><br>The immediate military impact of the operation was slight but its consequences were enormous in terms of the destruction and devastation that followed. The European war had now spread deep into the eastern Mediterranean, and over the next four years it would incinerate the Ottoman Empire’s social fabric. By stepping into the fire of war, the Ottoman leadership demonstrated commitment to its German allies. Berlin would have to honour Ottoman interests in any negotiated peace settlement—provided, of course that Berlin itself would be sitting at the negotiating table, either as victor or on equal terms with its adversaries. ‘When I contemplate all that Russia has done for centuries to bring about our destruction, and all that Britain has done during these last few years,’ declared Cemal Pasha, the navy minister, ‘then I consider this new crisis that has emerged to be a blessing. I believe that it is the Turks’ [<i>Türklerin</i>] ultimate duty either to live like an honourable nation or to exit the stage of history gloriously’.33 Goltz Pasha expressed the event in similarly grandiose terms: ‘Bravo, Old Turkey now has the opportunity <b>(p.25)</b> […] in one fell swoop, to lift herself up to the heights of her former glory. May she not miss this opportunity!’34
<br><br>In the first five months of its participation in the war, Istanbul launched three additional campaigns—one ideological, two military. In November 1914, the Ottoman sultan declared the war to be a holy war, calling not only on the empire’s own Muslim subjects but also on Muslims worldwide, residing in the empires of Britain, France, and Russia, to support the Ottoman war effort and that of its allies, the German and Habsburg empires. Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, in particular, had demanded such a declaration, and, while the Ottoman leadership was seemingly complying with the kaiser’s wishes, Istanbul had its own, domestic agenda for the jihad proclamation. From the Ottoman perspective, the jihad declaration did not aim so much at mobilizing Muslim populations in the colonial empires of the Entente—in British India and Egypt, the Russian Caucasus and Central Asia, and French North Africa—but at mobilizing the Ottoman Empire’s own Muslim populations behind Osman’s banner.35
<br><br>Next, Istanbul launched two offensive operations into former Ottoman territories. In late 1914, the Third Army crossed into territory lost to Russia in 1878. In early 1915, a force led by Cemal Pasha attempted to cross the Suez Canal into Egypt, occupied by Britain since 1882. Both campaigns failed, and neither operation succeeded in inspiring revolution among the Muslims of the Russian and British empires. Aimed at capturing the town of Sarıkamış, the campaign into Russia resulted in a military disaster. Fighting in freezing temperatures and already riddled by disease, the Ottoman Third Army lost tens of thousands of its men within a few days.36 In the collective memory of the war in Turkey, the Sarıkamış fiasco has been a mirror image to the triumph of Gallipoli of 1915–16. And, while Sarıkamış became personified by Enver and stood for the empire’s failures and decay, Gallipoli became personified by Mustafa Kemal and stood for the republic’s defining triumph, the ‘Turks’ finest hour’. In its immediate aftermath, however, the defeat was pinned on the region’s Armenian population and Armenian volunteer battalions that had joined the Russian side.
<br><br>Violence and Viability
<br><br>In 1909 the new parliament passed a law for mandatory military service that applied to all Ottomans of military age, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. In 1911, nearly one-quarter of all the youths entering military service were non-Muslim. <b>(p.26)</b> The wars of 1911–13, however, and the strains they placed on Muslim–Christian relations inside the empire, undermined attempts at using the imperial army as a unifying ‘school of the nation’ (as Mustafa Kemal later described the Turkish military in the republic). With the declaration of mobilization in August 1914, the army conscripted all men between the ages of 20 and 45—some three million altogether by the war’s end. While the majority of conscripts originated from Anatolia, perhaps over a quarter came from the empire’s Arab lands.37 Food and labour shortages among civilian populations set in immediately. Scores of soldiers succumbed to disease even before the empire had entered the war in late October 1914, while others deserted.
<br><br>If imperial coexistence was still possible in August 1914, that possibility was destroyed over the course of the war. War in August 1914 immediately intensified accusations of non-Muslims’ and non-Turks’ alleged disloyalty to the empire. Armenians, and Kurds, were cast as potential allies of Russia; Jews as those of Britain; Arab Christians, of France; Arab Muslims (around Sharif Husayn of Mecca), of Britain; and Orthodox Christians, of Greece. A violent dynamic emerged, and grew stronger as the war continued: the state took pre-emptive measures against populations whose loyalty it suspected, while those steps in turn antagonized entire regions. The conflicts that resulted from these state policies together with wartime conditions of hunger, disease, and famine, over the course of four years, dissolved all remaining imperial sinews.
<br><br>Armenian conscripts, in particular, were suspected of deserting to the Russian side as soon as the war began. Small movements among Armenians calling for independence had existed since the 1870s, but neither Armenian elites nor the patriarchy in Istanbul, nor the roughly 2.1 million Armenians, largely peasants, had supported revolutionary groups.38 Already before the defeat at Sarıkamış had become apparent, however, Armenians in the ranks were being singled out as potential defectors to the Russian side. Some were being shot pre-emptively—‘accidentally’, as one soldier, Ali Rıza, reported.39 These suspicions appeared confirmed when several volunteer battalions, consisting of Ottoman Armenians and led by a former deputy in the Ottoman parliament, formed alongside the Russian army.40 Ali Rıza could not believe that Armenians and Turks could ever be ‘brothers and fellow citizens’ again, swearing that he would ‘poison and kill 3 or 4 Armenians’ when given the opportunity. The ties that had held together the empire’s ethnic and religious groups were now rapidly being destroyed.41
<br><br><b>(p.27)</b> Following the Sarıkamış disaster, on 25 February 1915, War Minister Enver issued an official order for all Armenians in uniform to be disarmed and placed in labour battalions, rendering them ‘sitting ducks’.42 With the bitter defeats at Sarıkamış and Suez behind them, and facing an Allied naval attack at the Straits, the Unionists by April 1915 declared Armenians to be in rebellion. On 24 April 1915, the government began arrests of Armenian political leaders, businessmen, and intellectuals, including those residing in Istanbul. On 27 May 1915, Interior Minister Talat issued orders for the deportation of Armenians on the grounds that they endangered Ottoman military operations. In July 1915, the army was assigning soldiers to labour in agriculture ‘because all the Armenians have been deported and the Muslims have been conscripted’. If no soldiers were made available, the harvest would be jeopardized and ‘dearth and famine’ would seize the country, endangering ‘the army’s supplies’ and thus opening the road to military ‘disaster’.43
<br><br>Dispossessed of their property and land, Armenians were marched southwards in a trail of tears during which many of the deported, especially women and children, starved to death, died of exhaustion, or were murdered. A tragically typical story is offered by Hagop Mıntzuri. Hagop had been born into an Armenian family near the city of Erzincan. Of military age, he was conscripted as a baker in August 1914. He would not see his wife, Voğida, or any of his four children, Nurhan aged 6, Maranik aged 4, Anahit aged 2, or baby Haço, ever again. They, along with Hagop’s 55-year-old mother, Nanik, and his 80-year-old grandfather, Melkon, and all the other Christians of the village, were deported, never to be heard from again.44
<br><br>Writing about the Armenian Aghet (‘the Catastrophe’) in 1921 from his hideout in Berlin, Talat claimed he first had opposed the deportation order because he knew that police and gendarmerie forces had been conscripted into the army and ‘replaced by militias’. To task these irregular forces with the gathering of Armenian village populations and their deportation, ‘I knew’, said Talat, ‘would have appalling consequences’.45 If these hesitations were ever authentic, by early 1915 they had disappeared. The stated purpose behind the deportations was to prevent any subversion of Ottoman military operations in eastern Anatolia by locals. Similar to the earlier expulsion of western Anatolia’s Greek Orthodox (Ottoman Turkish: <i>Rum</i>) in the spring 1914, the expulsion of Anatolia’s Armenians aimed at eliminating all traces of any nationalist movement that could challenge Ottoman authority. When in May 1918 the government negotiated its eastern boundaries with Russia, Ottoman leaders opposed the creation of an Armenian state. Talat—since 1917 also grand vezir and hence ‘pasha’—had been born in territory ceded to Bulgaria. An Armenian state, he posited, would <b>(p.28)</b> ‘become a “Bulgaria of the East”’, a state intent on expansion at Ottoman expense, and therefore had to be avoided at all cost. The ‘abscess must be removed with its roots’, he added.46
<br><br>Arab and Kurdish leaders and populations whose loyalties the state questioned were also put under surveillance and deported. In August 1914, even before Istanbul had entered the First World War, for example, the governor of Bekaa district, a fertile valley home to sizeable Maronite Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Orthodox communities, expressed anxiety about the ‘malicious population of Mount Lebanon and especially the city of Zahla’. According to his report, the newspapers of Zahla were displaying ‘an excessive support for France’, thereby ‘wounding the hearts of the Muslim ummah’. This had been going on ‘since the Balkan wars’. By now Zahla’s ‘affection for France’ had reached ‘levels of worship’. Such audacity, the governor insisted, was unacceptable. He recommended the immediate dismissal of Zahla’s military governor, Ibrahim Abu Hatir Efendi, who was allowing ‘such open’ hostility to the Ottoman state, and the shuttering of the local paper, <i>Zahla al-Fatat</i>.47 Bekir Sami, Beirut’s governor, described the prevailing dynamic in Mount Lebanon in absolute terms: ‘Both the Maronites and the Orthodox support France and Russia in their hearts and minds [<i>kalben ve ruhen</i>].’48 As to the Druze, they had previously leaned towards Britain, but now, the governor surmised, ‘because they are more or less related to Islam, in their hearts they are leaning towards the Exalted Government of the sultan’. But, the governor went on, the British consul ‘is working day and night to win over the Druze’ to their side.
<br><br>The empire had entered the First World War at a moment when its imperial fabric, following the Balkan Wars, had already begun to fray. A tiny incident caused Governor Bekir Sami to blow his top, illustrating this highly charged climate. On 11 September 1914, a man by the name of Shoufani, in the village of Suq al-Gharb, created a public spectacle by taking down ‘an Ottoman flag flying over one of the shops and trampled it under his feet’. The local police officer forced Shoufani to return the flag, and left the matter at that. When Bekir Sami, Istanbul’s man on the spot, heard about the incident, he became enraged and reported the event back to the capital in the gravest possible terms. Shoufani’s action, he wrote, ‘proved the overt and blatant hatred the people of Mount Lebanon harbour against the government’. Unless strict measures were taken, the governor warned, more ‘incidents such as this one’ would occur. ‘I believe that the moment has come to take necessary measures against the Mountain [<i>Cebel’e karşı tedabir-i lazıma ittihazı zamanı geldiğine</i>].’ He proposed that the government end Mount Lebanon’s autonomous status, which had been in effect since 1861. By ruling Mount <b>(p.29)</b> Lebanon directly once again, Istanbul could tighten its grip on the region and exercise control over the population, Bekir Sami argued.49
<br><br>Mount Lebanon was put under strict surveillance because it was suspected ‘that with the influence of the [French] Consul in Beirut and the connivance of the railway company weapons would be smuggled inside Mount Lebanon’. Therefore, it was decided that ‘each and every train departing Beirut’ for Zahla ‘must be placed under continuous and secret surveillance’.50
<br><br>The region from Aleppo to Suez, the empire’s Arabic-speaking lands, was placed under the military rule of Cemal Pasha, the Commander of the Fourth Army. Acute shortages of food raged in all parts of the empire, but nowhere was it as ghastly as in Syria, and especially in Mount Lebanon. Cemal’s regime conscripted men into the army and labour battalions. It also raised special war taxes to finance the two attacks on the Suez Canal and Egypt. A plague of locusts, moreover, struck the region in 1915, eating up every green shoot. And an Anglo-French naval blockade prevented relief from arriving from outside. Shortages of trains, and their strict control by the military authorities, prevented the rapid dissemination of the food supply. The result was widespread starvation by December 1915. In Syria, one out of seven persons—over half a million people—had starved to death by war’s end (see Fig. 2 for attempts to destroy locust eggs using flamethrowers).
<br><br>Shakib Arslan, perhaps the most prominent Arab intellectual of the interwar period, acted as a critical liaison between Cemal Pasha and the Arab population under his rule. Shakib also knew well both Enver and Talat. In his account of his time as Cemal’s assistant, Shakib reports that he tried at great lengths to change Cemal’s mind about the arrests and deportations of Arab leaders. He especially opposed deportations and the public hangings of prominent Arabs in Beirut in August 1915 and in Damascus in May 1916. Shakib cautioned Cemal that the executions ‘will be the reason for the separation of Arabs and Turks’.51 One scholar has concluded that ‘Cemal’s actions in Syria were comparable in nature, if not in extent, to those policies pursued with respect to the Armenians in Eastern Anatolia. Both emanated from a fear that a nationalist uprising would come into being with encouragement from enemy powers.’ In both cases, however, ‘the threat was more perceived than real’.52
<br><br>Further research will have to show whether the state used food as a weapon against the population of Mount Lebanon and Syria, as many charged at the time. What is clear, however, is that the deprivation brought by the war and the state’s own policies enfeebled Ottoman legitimacy in the Arab lands. Ohannes Pasha, an Armenian Christian, assumed the post of governor of Mount Lebanon in 1913, <b>(p.30)</b> [Fig. 2. Locust burning in Palestine, c.1915. In a single day, a swarm the size of Manhattan could consume roughly the equivalent amount of food consumed by forty-two million humans over the same period] then still ‘a true Ottomanist’. By war’s end, his faith in the empire was dead.53 In Lebanese collective memory, the Ottoman word for mobilization from this era even today is recalled with a shudder.54Private İhsan, a conscript in Jerusalem, echoed similar feelings, noting in his diary on 17 December 1915: ‘If the government had any dignity, it would have saved wheat in its hangars for public distribution at a fixed price, or even have made it available from military supplies. If these conditions persist, the people will rebel and bring down this government.’55 As <b>(p.31)</b> Salim Tamari recently put it, ‘four miserable years of tyranny’, in the end, ‘erased four centuries of a rich and complex Ottoman patrimony’.56
<br><br>The Anglo-French naval blockade, parked off the Syrian coast, deepened the region’s prevailing conditions of the hunger crisis. During 1913–14, the empire had imported a net amount of roughly 88,000 tons of grain cereals. The war put an end to imports, while military conscription and the confiscation of draft animals reduced the available agricultural labour force. The acreage of harvested land was cut in about half. All those outside the age of military conscription became subject to agricultural conscription, as schoolchildren, the elderly, and women transformed into field workers. As conscription expanded to press ever more men into military service, the War Ministry established a women’s labour battalion that employed thousands of women.57
<br><br>As Syria’s famine was unfolding, the French consul in Cairo alerted his government to the fact that tens of thousands had starved to death and suggested providing relief through food aid. The British response, however, made clear that making conditions worse was the whole point of the blockade: ‘His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expresses his earnest hope that the French Government will not encourage any such scheme. […] The Entente Allies are simply being blackmailed to remedy the shortage of supplies which it is the very intention of the blockade to produce.’ The French concluded that their British allies ‘consider the famine as an agent that will lead the Arabs to revolt’.58
<br><br>Since his appointment in 1908 as the grand sharif of Mecca—the custodian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina—Husayn ibn Ali sought to govern Arabia with as little interference from Istanbul as possible. In return for this semi-autonomous rule, Husayn promised to provide public order and ensure the region’s stability. In August 1914, with war afoot in Europe, the local governor called for Husayn’s immediate dismissal. If the war continued, the governor claimed, the sharif would undoubtedly join a foreign power.59 Another imperial fissure threatened to burst under the weight of global and total war.
<br><br>By the time Husayn rose against Istanbul, in June 1916, his position had become untenable. After an eight-month campaign, despite great human and material losses, the Entente had abandoned its mission to capture the Dardanelles and Constantinople. In its main operation in Iraq, a British army, including a large contingent of Indian troops, had moved up from Basra, captured Baghdad, but suffered defeat at Kut in April 1916. Led by General Charles Townshend, British intelligence had counted on the support of the Shia population, whose loyalty to the <b>(p.32)</b> Ottoman Sunni state it considered weak. Under the circumstances, British pressure focused on the sharif. Stuck between Cemal Pasha’s iron reign, on the one hand, and the threat of British military invasion across the Red Sea, on the other, Husayn took the British offer for an Arab state under his rule. Equipped with British money, materiel, and intelligence, several thousand Arabs took up arms against Ottoman forces. Entente hopes that Husayn’s action would galvanize a general Arab revolt from Mecca to Damascus, however, were dashed. Crippled by famine, Syria proved to be tightly controlled by Cemal, as Husayn’s uprising failed to generate any serious challenges to imperial authority there.
<br><br>The Russian Revolution erupting in 1917 allowed the Ottomans to return to Erzurum and Trabzon, which the Russian army had previously occupied, and to garner additional territory in the Caucasus. As the war rolled on, however, the empire could not match the Entente’s resources and numerical superiority in manpower. British troops captured Jerusalem in December 1917. By October 1918, British forces had reached Aleppo in northern Syria, and a second British army was moving towards the Ottoman capital after breaking through at Salonica. The Ottomans, like their allies, had been defeated. On 30 October 1918, a group of Ottoman representatives signed an armistice aboard a British battleship. A few days later, another group of Ottomans, including Cemal, Enver, and Talat, escaped Istanbul for Europe aboard another vessel, this time a German one.
<br><br>Conclusion: The Slow End of Empire
<br><br>In both the occupied Arab lands and the unoccupied Anatolian lands the process by which empire was replaced by the nation state was far from straightforward. With the armistice in place, the Ottoman government aimed at preserving whatever territory remained unoccupied. Nor did the fighting stop. In the first half of 1919, British and French forces occupied Istanbul, while Greek forces landed on the Aegean coast in the west and Italian forces in the south. In the east, independent Armenian and Kurdish states were poised to take shape.
<br><br>In their own Wilsonian Moment, Ottoman officials and civic and political organizations evoked the US president’s twelfth point, which advocated ‘a secure sovereignty’ to the ‘Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire’. Flanked by posters displaying Wilson’s twelfth point, Halide Edib and a host of speakers addressed a crowd of 200,000 in May 1919. With British and French forces occupying the sultan’s government in Istanbul, local elites, former commanders, and demobilized soldiers formed resistance organizations. Initially these were relatively disjointed until they gained greater coordination in 1919. Eventually they became centralized under the command of Mustafa Kemal, the hero of Gallipoli and a former rival and political opponent of Enver Pasha. The ideology that undergirded this movement was based on religious rather than ethnic or national identity. In August 1920, the sultan’s government in Istanbul agreed to the signing of a peace treaty in the French town of Sèvres. News of the treaty galvanized the resistance movement, which rejected it, secured Bolshevik aid, and defeated Armenian forces <b>(p.33)</b> in the east before clashing repeatedly with Greek armies, culminating in the capture of Izmir amid great violence in September 1922. The Ankara assembly now abolished by vote the office of the sultanate, while retaining, however, the office of the caliphate for another two years. The Ottoman sultanate had come to an end. Ankara sent its representatives to Lausanne for peace negotiations. The resulting treaty, signed in July 1923, recognized the sovereignty of the Ankara government within the empire’s remaining territory. After much destruction, Wilson’s twelfth point, as far as the ‘Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire’ were concerned, had become reality. As for ‘the other nationalities’, a new regime of British and French mandates was set up, but certainly not one that afforded ‘an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development’, as Wilson had put it unproblematically.
<br><br>The structural weaknesses that plagued the empire from the nineteenth century forward—its military insecurity, the unresolved questions of ethnic and religious plurality, wanting economic development—also defined, in varying degrees, the unstable regimes that replaced the Ottomans. The great number of casualties, displaced people, and forced migrations, moreover, produced long-term socio-economic consequences, as urban populations did not return to pre-war levels until the early 1950s. In Anatolia/Turkey, living standards dropped dramatically; GDP in the 1920s stood at about half of pre-war figures.60 The population of Ottoman Anatolia hovered just under sixteen million in 1913; as late as 1927 it was still under fourteen million.61 The war’s transformative effects on Syria were no less profound, as it left behind an equally devastated landscape and a ‘shattered social order’.62
<br><br>War in the Ottoman Empire during 1911–22 generated conditions that destroyed the state’s imperial fabric. Halide Edib’s retrospective wish that there had been a ‘far-sighted policy’ is worth recalling. The history of the empire’s final decade continues to be deeply politicized. The ‘political tragedy’ and ‘cataclysm’ David Stevenson recognizes in his history of Europe has an Ottoman version as well: here the tragedy is that the Ottoman leaders who were brought to power by the wars of 1911–13 were no longer able to see political solutions and instead opted for military ones. They did so because of the empire’s experience since the nineteenth century. Having given up on diplomacy and institutions of the international system, they opted for refashioning the empire and its people into a ‘nation in arms’. Not all of the empire’s peoples would be willing or given the opportunity to serve in that ‘nation in arms’. That new direction heralded the end of the empire.
