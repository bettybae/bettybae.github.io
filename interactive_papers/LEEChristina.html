	case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<p><b>LOTHAR-GUNTHER BUCHHEIM</b></p><p><b>Lothar-Günther Buchheim</b> was a late German author, painter, and art collector best known for his novel <i>Das Boot</i> in 1973[1]. Born in Weimar, Germany on February 6, 1918[2], Buccheim started writing for several newspapers at the age of 14[3]. At 15, he was editing the art pages of the newspaper, as well as showcasing his own drawings[4]. His talent led him to study art in Dresden and Munich but his education was cut short when he went to volunteer for the German navy in 1940[5], at the age of 23. As a naval propaganda writer and lieutenant, Buccheim’s job was to record his experiences in multiple vessels and U-boats[6]. One incident in particular was the highlight of his experience and the inspiration for his book, <i>Das Boot</i>. Described as a “visual person”[7], Buchheim had an eye for detail and connection with humanity, documenting his experiences and discoveries as they were[8]. However, during his service, Buchheim was ordered to write reports with positive propaganda[9]. What he failed to convey in his reports, Buchheim may have incorporated it in <i>Das Boot</i>, the “thinly disguised autobiography in which he appeared as Lieutenant Werner, a naval writer” [10]. </p><p>Buchheim’s novel was adapted into a film in 1981 [11] and a subsequent TV mini-series in 1985 [12], both called <i>Das Boot</i>, of which the 1981 film version was nominated for six Oscars [13]. He passed away on February 22, 2007, in Starnberg, Bavaria, Germany, due to a heart failure [14]. His legacy remains in his works, as well as the Buchheim Museum[15] in Bernried, Germany, where he was buried [16]. The exhibition includes Buchheim’s personal art collection as well as his own paintings and photographs reflecting his penchant for “strongly expressive, vividly colorful and intricately crafted works”[17]. </p><p>References</p><br><sup>1</sup> Goodreads. “Author Profile: Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” Accessed May 5, 2014. <a href=“http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/517153.Lothar_G_nther_Buchheim”>http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/517153.Lothar_G_nther_Buchheim</a><br><br><sup>2</sup> IMDb. “Biography: Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” Accessed May 5, 2014. <a href=“http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118164/bio”>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118164/bio”</a><br><br><sup>3</sup> Van der Vat, Dan. “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <i>The Guardian</i>, March 5, 2007. <a href=“http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/05/guardianobituaries.germany”>http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/05/guardianobituaries.germany</a><br><br><sup>4</sup> Van der Vat, “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>5</sup> Van der Vat, “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>6</sup> Van der Vat, “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>7</sup> Buchheim Museum. “Buchheim Collection – Museum of Imagination.” Accessed May 12, 2014. <a href=“http://www.buchheimmuseum.de/international/english.php”>http://www.buchheimmuseum.de/international/english.php</a><br><br><sup>8</sup> Buchheim Museum. “Buchheim Collection – Museum of Imagination.” <br><br><sup>9</sup> Van der Vat, “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>10</sup> Van der Vat, “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>11</sup> IMDb. “Das Boot 1981.” Accessed May 12, 2014. <a href=“http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/?ref_=nmbio_mbio”>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/?ref_=nmbio_mbio</a><br><br><sup>12</sup> IMDb. “Das Boot 1985: TV mini series.” Accessed May 12, 2014.<a href=“http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081834/?ref_=nmbio_mbio”>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081834/?ref_=nmbio_mbio</a><br><br><sup>13</sup> IMDb. “Das Boot 1981.” <br><br><sup>14</sup> IMDb. “Biography: Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” <br><br><sup>15</sup> Buchheim Museum. “Buchheim Collection – Museum of Imagination.” <br><br><sup>16</sup> Find A Grave. “Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.” Accessed May 12, 2014. <a href=“http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18089485”>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=18089485</a><br><br><sup>17</sup> Buchheim Museum. “Buchheim Collection – Museum of Imagination.” <br>'); break;

case 4: $("div#commentary").html('Selections about “<b>Destroyer</b>” from Max Hastings, <i>Inferno: The World at War, 1939-1945</i>(2011)<br><br>“In the first days of April, as snow vanished from the Continent, the armies emerged as if from hibernation, looking about to discern what the new campaigning season might bring. At last, Churchill persuaded his government colleagues to support the mining of Norwegian waters. Four destroyers put to sea to execute this operation, while a small land force embarked at British ports, ready to sail to Norway if the Germans responded to the Royal Navy’s initiative. London was oblivious of the fact that a German fleet was already at sea. For months, the Fiihrer had been fearful of British intervention in Norway, because of its implications for his iron-ore supplies. His agitation acquired urgency on 14 February 1940, when Royal Navy destroyers pursued the <i>Graf Spee’s</i> supply ship <i>Altmark</i> into a Norwegian fjord to free 299 captive British merchant sea- men. Determined to preempt a British initiative to seize a foothold in Norway, on 2 April he gave the final order for the invasion fleet to sail.” (42)<br><br>“The Germans suffered the heaviest casualties in the Norwegian campaign—5,296 compared with the British 4,500, most of the latter incurred when the carrier <i>Glorious</i> and its escorts were sunk by the battle cruiser <i>Scharnhorst</i> on 8 June. The French and a Polish exile contingent lost 530 dead, the Norwegians about 1,800. The Luftwaffe lost 242 planes, the RAF 112. Three British cruisers, seven destroyers, an aircraft carrier and four sub- marines were sunk, against three German cruisers, ten destroyers, and six submarines. Four further German cruisers and six destroyers were badly damaged.” (51)

	<b>LOTHAR-GONTHER BUCHHEIM</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	FROM <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">The Boat</a></i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The weather has grown even worse. Low-hanging squalls of rain darken the sky around us. All the daylight is gone: It might as well be evening. Wind-driven spray covers the watery landscape with a pale mist.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The boat’s rolling heavily. Waves coming from the port beam. Water spurts through the open hatch, but we have to keep this open because the enemy may surprise the boat at any moment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The propellers race, the diesels are running flat out. The <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Commander</a> is rooted to the bridge. Under the rain-slicked downturned brim of his sou' wester he searches the sea. He stands motionless; only his head pivots slowly from side to side.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After a quarter of an hour I climb down to inspect developments on the chart table. The navigator is hard at work calculating. Without lifting his eyes he says, “Here we are—and here's where we can expect the convoy. Unless it's tacked again."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Standing around aimlessly embarrasses me. I already have my left hand on the aluminum ladder when I tell myself that all this climbing up and down makes me look nervous. Just take it easy: relax. Whatever's happening, I'll find out in good time. How late is it really? Past twelve? Well, I just have to act as though none of this is out of the ordinary so I peel off my wet things. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I sit in the mess, trying to read a book, until the steward finally brings in plates and cups for lunch. The Commander doesn't appear.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We've scarcely sat down at the table—the Chief, the Second Engineer, and I—when there's a roar from the control room. The Chief looks up quickly. A report comes down from the bridge. “Masthead off the port bow!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Almost without thinking, I'm halfway to the control room: the convoy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I'm ahead of the Chief to the bridge. The rain is worse. My sweater is immediately soaked from spray and the downpour. I was in such a hurry, I forgot to grab my oilskin from its hook. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I hear the Commander. "Hard to starboard. Steer one hundred eighty degrees!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A bridge guard hands me his binoculars unasked. I start searching the same area as the Commander. Gray streamers of rain. Nothing else. Holding my breath, I force myself to stay calm, search the right hand edge of this banner of water and then swing my glasses very slowly across it to the left. There—in the streaks of gray—a hair-breadth line that immediately disappears again. An illusion? Imagination? I take a deep breath, relax my knees, give myself a gentle shake, balance the glasses on my fingertips. The boat heaves under me. I lose my bearings, then reorient myself by the Commander. There it is again.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It trembles and dances in the glasses. A mast! No doubt of it. But—a mast and no accompanying plume of smoke? Only this single hairline? Hard as I look, I can find nothing else; it seems to be pushing its way slowly over the horizon.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Every steamer is supposed to have a plume of smoke that betrays it long before its radio masts appear. So this can't be a steamer.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Hell and damnation-where is it? Now I have it again. I should be able to see it with the naked eye. I put down my glasses and search- there it is all right!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander is chewing his lower lip. He takes up the binoculars again, muttering half to himself-"Shit! <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">Destroyer</a>!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A minute goes by. My eyes are glued to the thin line above the horizon. I'm choking with excitement.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	No more doubt about it: It's a radio mast, so the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">destroyer</a>  is coming directly at us. Without slow engines there's no chance we can get away on the surface.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"They must have seen us. Goddammit!" The Commander's voice hardly changes at all as he gives the alarm.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	One bound and I'm down the tower hatch. Boots ringing on the floor plates. The Commander is the last in. He pulls the hatch shut. Even before it's completely sealed he orders, "Flood!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	He stays in the tower. In a steady voice he calls instructions down to the control tower. "Proceed at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">periscope</a> depth!" The Chief balances the boat. The needle of the depth <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">manometer</a> stops, then slowly moves backward over the scale. Dufte is beside me, breathing heavily in his wet oilskins. Zeitler and Bockstiegel are sitting in front of the buttons of the hydroplane controls, their eyes glued to the water column in the Papen- berg. The First Watch Officer bends forward to let the rainwater run off the brim of his sou' wester.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	No one says a word. Only the electric hum of the motors can be heard, as if through padded doors, coming from the stern.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	From above us, the voice of the Commander finally breaks the silence. "Report depth."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Seventy feet!" from the Chief.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The water column in the Papenberg sinks slowly: the boat is rising. The lens of the periscope soon comes clear.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The boat is not yet on an even keel, so the Chief orders water pumped from the forward trim tank toward the stern. Slowly the boat attains the horizontal. But it doesn't stay there. The waves roll us in all directions. Sucking, dragging, pushing. Periscope observation is going to be damned difficult.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I listen intently, waiting to hear from the Commander, when the hydrophone operator reports, "Destroyer hard on the starboard beam!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I pass the report up. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Acknowledged." Then, just as dryly, "Man hattie stations!" The operator is bent out of the sound room into the passageway, his eyes wide and blank. The direct lighting makes his face a flat mask, the nose simply two holes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Along with the Commander, the operator is now the only one in contact with the world outside our steel tube. The Commander can see the enemy, the operator hears him. The rest of us are blind and deaf. "Auditory contact stronger-moving slowly astern!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander's voice sounds choked. "Flood tubes one to four!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Just as I thought: The Old Man is going to take on the destroyer. He wants a red pennant. The only thing still missing from his collection. When he ordered periscope after the alarm, I knew for sure.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	His voice comes down again. "<i>To</i> control room-Chief-hold our exact depth!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	How can he possibly do it, I ask myself, in this rough sea? The muscles in the Chiefs gaunt face tense and relax rhythmically. He looks as if he's chewing gum. If the boat rises too far, and the upper part of the hull breaks the surface-disaster: it will betray us to the enemy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander is astride the periscope saddle in the narrow space between the periscope shaft and the tower wall, his face pressed against the rubber shell, his thighs spread wide to grip the huge shaft. His feet are on the pedals that enable him to spin the great column and his saddle through 360 degrees without making a sound; his right hand rests on the lever that raises and lowers it. The periscope motor hums. He's lowering it a little, keeping its head as close to the surface of the water as he possibly can.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Chief is standing immobile behind the two men of the bridge watch who are now operating the hydroplanes. His eyes are glued to the Papenberg and its slowly rising and falling column of water. Each change in it means the boat is doing the same.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Not a word from anyone. The humming of the periscope motor sounds as if it's coming through a fine filter; the motor starts, stops, starts again, and the humming resumes. The Commander ups periscope for fractions of a second and immediately lets it sink below the surface again. The destroyer must be very close.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Flood tube five." The order is a whisper.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It's passed on softly to the main motor room. We're in the midst of battle.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I sink down onto the frame of the circular door. The whispered report comes back from astern, "Tube five ready to fire when torpedo door opened. "
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So-all tubes are flooded. All that's needed is to open the doors and release a blast of compressed air to send them on their way. The Commander wants to know the position of the helm.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Suddenly I notice that I still have a half-chewed bit of bread in my mouth. Mushy bread and sausage fat. It's beginning to taste sour.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have the feeling that I've lived all this somewhere before. Images shift about in my mind, jostling, overlaying one another, merging into new combinations. My immediate impressions seem to be being trans- mitted by a complicated circuit to my brain center from which they re- emerge into my consciousness as memories.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Old Man's mad-attacking a destroyer in this sea.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But it has its advantages too. Our periscope can't be all that visible. The streamer of foam that would betray it must be hard to distinguish among the cresting waves.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The drip in the bilge is deafening. Sounds as if it's coming over a loudspeaker. Lucky that everything's worked so far: no problem maintaining depth. The Chief was well prepared, had it all figured out.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If the Old Man decides to fire, the Chief must flood at once to make up for the weight of the torpedo. Otherwise the boat will rise. A torpedo weighs three thousand pounds-so an equivalent weight of water has to be taken on for each one launched. Multiplied by the number of torpedoes fired-it's a lot.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Not a word from the Commander.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It's very difficult to hit a destroyer. Shallow draft. Easily maneuverable. But score a hit, and it's gone in a flash, blown away. The explosion of the torpedo, a geyser of water and torn steel, then nothing.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander's steady voice comes down. "Open torpedo doors. Switch on tubes one and two! Enemy course fifteen. Bow left. Direction sixty. Range one thousand!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Second Watch officer puts the figures in the calculator. The bow compartment reports torpedo doors opened. The First Watch Officer relays the message softly but distinctly. "Tubes one and two ready to fire!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander has his hand on the firing lever and is waiting for the enemy to move into the crosshairs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If only we were able to see!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Imagination runs riot in this silence. Visions of catastrophe: a destroyer swinging until it's at angle zero. The foaming bow, the white bone in its teeth, towering over us, ready to ram. Staring eyes, the sharp rending of metal, jagged edges of steel, green surge of water through fissures like opened stopcocks.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The voice of the Commander, as sharp as a descending whiplash. "Close torpedo doors. Dive to two hundred feet. Fast!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Chief is only a fraction of a second behind him. "Hard down both-both engines full ahead! All hands forward!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Loud confusion of voices. I flinch, press myself to one side, have trouble staying on my feet. The first man is already forcing his way through the circular door aft, staggers, recovers his balance and rushes, half crouched, past the sound room toward the bow.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Wide-open questioning eyes fixed on me. Chaos: slipping, stumbling, hurrying, staggering. Two bottles of lemonade come tumbling in from the petty officers' mess and smash noisily against the wall of the control room.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Both hydroplanes are hard down. The boat is already distinctly bow heavy, but the men keep coming from astern. They slide through the tilted control room as if it's a chute; one falls full length, cursing.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Only the engine room personnel are left in the after part of the ship. The floor slips away beneath me. Fortunately I manage to grab the periscope stanchion. The sausages swing out at an angle from the wall. I hear the Old Man's voice from above us, cutting through the scuffling and stamping of boots. "Depth charges next!" He sounds perfectly calm, as though passing on a piece of casual information.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	He climbs down with exaggerated deliberation, as if it's an exercise. Traverses the slope, hanging on to both sides, and props one buttock on the chart chest. His right hand grasps a water pipe for support.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The chief slowly levels the boat out and orders, "Man diving stations!" The seamen who rushed forward now work their way backhand over hand up the slope. The sausages act like a scale: we're still a good thirty degrees bow heavy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i>Rrabaum!-Rrum!-Rrum!</i>
	
	<p>
	Three crashing sledgehammer blows spin me around. Half stunned, I hear a dull roar. What is it? Fear claws at my heart: that roaring! Finally I identify it: it's water pouring back into the vacuum created in the sea by the explosion.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Two more monstrous explosions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The control-room mate has hunched his head into his shoulders. The new control-room assistant, the Bible Scholar, staggers and seizes hold of the chart table.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another explosion, louder than the rest. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The lights go out. Darkness!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Auxiliary lighting gone," someone calls.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The orders from the Chief seem to come from a distance. Pocket flashlights cut whitish cones in the darkness. Someone calls for a damage report. The section leaders' replies come through the speaking tubes. "Bow compartment in order!"—“Main motor room in order!”—“Engine room in order!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"No leakage," says the navigator. His voice is as matter-of-fact as the Commander's.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Before long, two double explosions make the floor plates dance.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Pump out torpedo cell one!" With a sharp hum the bilge pump springs into action. As soon as the roar of the detonations has subsided, the pump will be stopped again. Otherwise it could supply a bearing to the enemy's hydrophones.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Raise bow!" The Chief to the hydroplane operators. "Boat's in balance," he reports to the Commander.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"There'll be more," says the Old Man. "They actually saw our periscope. Amazing-with the sea running this high."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	He looks around. No trace of fear on his face. There's even an undertone of scorn in his voice. "Now it's psychological warfare, gentle- men."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Ten minutes pass; nothing happens. Suddenly a violent explosion shakes the whole boat. Then another and another. It quivers and groans.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Fifteen!" counts the navigator. "Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Chief stares at the needle of the depth manometer, which jumps a couple of points at each detonation. His eyes are huge and dark. The Commander's are closed to obliterate his surroundings and concentrate on his calculations: our own course, enemy course, ways of escape. He must react with lightning speed. He's the only one among the lot of us who's actually fighting. Our lives hang on the correctness of his orders.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Hard a-port!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Helm hard a-port!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Hold zero bearing!" The Commander never stops calculating. The basic factors in his reckoning change with each report; he must determine an escape route according to the strength of the sound of propellers and the approach angle of the destroyer. His senses no longer supply him with any immediate information: he must guide the boat like a pilot flying blind, his decisions based on indications given him by the instruments.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Against closed eyelids I see the gray-black cans twisting heavily as they shoot downward from the launchers, plunge into the water, spin lazily into the depths leaving bubbling trails, and then explode in the darkness-blazing fireballs of magnesium, incandescent suns.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Water transmits pressure much more strongly than air. If an intense pressure wave hits a boat it rips it apart at the seams. To destroy a submerged U-boat, depth charges don't have to hit it; they need only explode within the so-called lethal radius. The small depth charges dropped by airplanes weigh about 150 pounds, the destroyer bombs about 500 pounds. At a depth of 350 feet, the lethal radius extends about 275 to 350 feet. Once you've learned something, it sticks. I feel a kind of satisfaction that I now know this kind of thing by heart.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For a while all is quiet. I strain my ears. No propeller noise, no splashing of bombs. Only the thin humming of our electric motors. Not even the sound of breathing. The Commander suddenly seems to re- member that we're here. He doesn't move, but he glances around and whispers, "I could see them clearly. They were standing on the bridge, gaping straight at us. There were three men in the crow's nest. A corvette!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	He bends forward and whispers through the circular door to the soundman, "See if they're going away." Still bending forward a minute later, his question becomes more urgent: "Louder or weaker?"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The operator answers immediately. "No change." It's Herrmann: face like a Noh-mask-colorless, eyes and mouth thin lines. The Old Man orders us down farther.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Our pressure hull can withstand a good deal. But the flanges, all those damned pierced sections, are our Achilles' heel. And there are too many of them.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The most dangerous bombs for the boat are those that explode diagonally under the keel, because the underside has the largest number of flanges and outboard plugs. The deeper you go, the smaller the lethal radius: the water pressure, which is itself a threat at such depths because of the overloading on the seams, also limits the effective radius of the bombs-at 130, it's perhaps 160 feet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Suddenly a handful of pebbles rattles against the boat.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Asdic!" I hear a voice from the stern end of the control room. The jagged word suddenly stands out in my head in glaring capitals.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A shudder runs down my spine: <i>Anti-Submarine Development Investigation Committee</i>; the supersonic detection system!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It's the impact of the directional beam against our side that produces' this low tinkling, chirping sound. In the absolute silence it has all the force of a siren. Time between impulses: about thirty seconds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Turn it off!" I want to shout. The chirping grates on my nerves. No one dares so much as lift his head or speak, even though it will find us even if we remain as silent as the grave. Against it, silence is useless. So is stopping the E-motors. Normal hydrophones are outclassed by the E-motors, but the Asdic isn't dependent on sound, it reacts to our mass. Depth no longer affords any protection.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The nervous tension is infectious. My hands are shaking. I'm glad I don't have to stand up; instead I'm able to sit in the frame of the circular doorway. I tryout actions that require no major bodily movement: swallowing, blinking, grinding my teeth, making faces-a crease to the right, a crease to the left, forcing saliva between my teeth.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The operator whispers, "Getting louder!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander frees himself from the periscope shaft, makes his way past me almost on tiptoe. "Any change in direction?"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Bearing still two hundred ninety-five degrees."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Four detonations in quick succession. The roaring, gurgling surge of the explosions has barely subsided when the Commander says in a low voice, "She was well camouflaged, a fairly old ship, rather squat."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A hard blow against my feet jolts me badly. The floor plates rattle.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Twenty-seven-twenty-eight!" the navigator counts, trying to imitate the Old Man's elaborate casualness.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A pail goes rattling partway across the floor plates. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Hell and damnation-quiet!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now it sounds as if the pebbles are in a tin can, being shaken this way and that; in between is a louder, singing sound, with an underlying quick, sharp chirping, like crickets-the whirling propeller blades of the corvette. I stand rigid, frozen. I don't dare make the slightest movement; it's as if any motion, even the smallest slithering sound, would bring the beating propellers closer. Not a flicker of an eyelash, a twitch of the eye, not a breath, not a quiver of a nerve, not a ripple of the muscles, not even a goose pimple.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another five bombs! The navigator adds them to the total. My expression doesn't change. The Commander raises his head. Clearly emphasizing each word, he speaks into the echo of the crashing water. "Keep calm -calm, gentlemen. This is nothing at all"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	His quiet voice does us good, eases our jangled nerves.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now we are struck by a single ringing blow, like a giant cudgel on a sheet of steel. Two or three men begin to stagger.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The air is hazy, hanging in blue layers. And again the heavy explosions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Thirty-four-thirty-five-thirty-six!" This time the counting comes in a whisper.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander remains firm. "What in the world-is bothering you?" He withdraws into himself once more, calculating courses. It's deathly still in the boat. After a while the whispering voice comes again. "What's his bearing now?"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Two hundred sixty degrees-getting louder!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander raises his head. He's reached a decision. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Hard a-starboard!" And immediately afterward, "Sound room- we're turning to starboard!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A wrench has to be passed through to the stern. I reach for it eagerly and hand it on. Dear god, to be able to do something-turn hand wheels, adjust levers, man the pumps . . .
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The operator leans out into the passageway again. His eyes are open but he's staring into infinity. He sounds like a medium speaking. "Sounds growing louder-two hundred thirty-two hundred twenty."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Nonessential lights out," the Old Man orders. "Who the hell knows how long we may need the current!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The operator reports again, "Attacking again-sounds bearing two hundred ten degrees-getting louder fast! Quite close!" The excitement has upset his delivery.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander orders: "Both engines full ahead!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The seconds stretch out. Nothing. No one moves. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Let's hope they don't get their friends in on it!" The Old Man voices a fear that's been in my bones for a long time: the sweepers, the killers ... a pack of dogs is death to the hare.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Whoever has us on the hook now is no beginner, and we're defense- less in spite of the five torpedoes in our tubes. We can't surface, we can't come speeding from behind cover and throw ourselves on the enemy. We haven't even the grim assurance to be had from simply holding a weapon in your hand. We can't so much as shout at them. Just creep away. Keep going deeper. How deep are we now? I can't believe my eyes: the pointer of the manometer stands at 465. "Shipyard guarantee three hundred" flashes through my mind.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Ten minutes pass and nothing happens.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another handful of pebbles hits the boat high up on the port buoyancy tank. I can see from the operator's face that more depth charges are coming. He's moving his lips, counting the seconds before detonation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The first is so well aimed that I feel the shock all the way up my spine. We're in a huge drum with a steel plate for a drumhead. I see the navigator's lips moving but I hear nothing. Have I gone deaf?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But now I can hear the Commander. He's ordering higher speed again. He raises his voice to be heard over the pandemonium. "All right! Carryon just as you are, gentlemen, pay no attention to this nonsense! At home there are . . . "
	</p>
	
	<p>
	He breaks off in mid-sentence. Suddenly there's a humming stillness. Only the occasional swish and slap from the bilge.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Bow up! Steady!" the Chief orders the hydroplane men. His whisper sounds too loud in the silence. Once again the E-motors have been reduced to crawling speed. Bilge water gurgles toward the stern. Just where does it all come from? Wasn't it properly bailed in advance?
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Thirty-eight ... forty-one!" the navigator counts.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	With the roaring and bursting of the bombs still in my ears the silence that follows seems like a bizarre acoustical black hole, bottomless. Probably just to keep the silence from becoming too painful, the Commander whispers, "I'm not sure whether those characters up there are in contact!" At the same moment new detonations shake the depths: the answer is plain.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Once more my ears can't distinguish one explosion from the next. Nor have I any impression of whether the bombs are exploding right or left, above or below the boat. But the Old Man can obviously locate them. He's probably the only one who knows our position relative to our tormentor. Or is the navigator calculating too? In any case I no longer have the slightest clue. I see only the needle of the depth manometer moving slowly forward over the dial. We're going deeper again.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Chief is bending forward toward the hydroplane operators. His face is thrown into unnatural relief against the dark background, like that of an actor lit only by the footlights, every bone emphasized by dark lines or shadow. His hand looks waxen. There's a black streak across his right cheek. He's narrowed his eyes as if dazzled by the light.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The two hydroplane operators crouch motionless in front of their control buttons. Even when they change the hydroplane settings one sees no movement. The slight pressure of a finger requires no shift of their limbs. Our hydroplanes are power-operated. What more could we possibly want? Except for some piece of equipment that would allow us to observe the enemy from way down here.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A breathing space? I try to settle myself more firmly. The corvette certainly won't keep us waiting long. It's simply circling again; even when it's moving away from us, the goddamn Asdic keeps us cornered. The people up there have got every man they can spare on the bridge, peering at the choppy sea, searching the marbled foam for some sign of us. Nothing-zebra patterns drawn in green; green and white oxgall paper streaked with black . . . but it's the iridescent sheen of oil they're really after.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Still no move from the hydrophone operator: no sounds to report.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A strange clicking noise. A new device to locate us? Minutes pass. No one moves a muscle. The clicking stops; in its place another handful of pebbles strikes the boat, small gravel stones this time. Abruptly the Commander raises his head. "D'you think we'll get them—again?"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Get them again? Does he mean the convoy, or the corvette?
	He leans forward and speaks softly to the hydrophone man. "Find out if she's going away." Seconds later he asks impatiently, "Louder or weaker?"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Staying the same," replies the operator, and after a while, "Getting louder."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Any deviation?" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Bearing still two hundred twenty degrees." 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander immediately has the rudder put hard to starboard. So we're going to double back again. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	And now he orders both motors slow ahead. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Drops of condensation punctuate the tense silence at regular intervals: <i>Pit-pat-tick-tack-pitch-patch.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A hard blow makes the floor plates jump and rattle. "Forty-seven- forty-eight." And then, "Forty-nine-fifty-fifty-one."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A glance at my wristwatch: 14:30. When was the alarm? Must have been shortly after twelve. We've been under pursuit for two hours!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My watch has a red second hand on the same pin as the two main hands, so that it's constantly circling the dial in a series of jerky movements. I concentrate on this hand, measuring the interval between the individual detonations: two minutes, thirty seconds-another one' thirty seconds-the next; then twenty seconds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I'm happy to have something to do. Nothing else exists. I take a tighter grip with my right hand as though to focus my concentration. It has to come to an end. <i>Has to.</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another hard, sharp blow: forty-four seconds this time. Up to this point I've been mouthing syllables noiselessly, but now I can clearly feel my lips spread into a flattened oval, baring my teeth. Now I need my left hand to hang on with too.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander orders us down another seventy feet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Almost seven hundred now. A loud crackling and snapping runs through the boat. The new control-room assistant glances at me in fear.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Only the woodwork," whispers the Commander.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"It's the wooden paneling that creaks and snaps so loudly. The interior structure can't stand the compression. Seven hundred feet. Every square inch of steel skin now has to withstand a weight of 284 pounds, which means over twenty tons per square foot. All this on a hull less than an inch thick.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The crackling's getting sharper. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Unpleasant," murmurs the Chief. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The excruciating tension exerted on the steel skin is torture to me: I feel as if my own skin were being stretched. Another crack resounds, as loud as a rifle shot, and my scalp twitches. Under this insane pressure our hull is as fragile as an eggshell.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The ship's fly appears less than two feet away. I wonder how she likes this infernal drum solo. Each of us chooses his own fate: it's as true for the fly as it is for me. We both embarked on this undertaking of our own free will.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A double blow, then a third, not much weaker than its predecessors. The people up there are fishing for us with an even tighter net.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Renewed clattering of floor plates and deafening after-roar.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Peace lasts only a couple of heartbeats. Then two shattering blows and the glass plates of the depth manometers fall tinkling to the floor. The light goes out.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The cone of a pocket flashlight wavers across the walls and comes to rest on the dial of the depth manometer. I make a terrifying discovery: the hands of both manometers are gone. The water gauge between the two hydroplane operators has cracked and is shooting a hissing stream of water straight across the room.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Leak through the water gauge," I hear a shaky voice report. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander snarls, "Nonsense, cut the dramatics!" 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The empty dials stare like the eyes of a corpse. We can no longer tell whether the boat is sinking or rising. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My scalp crawls again. If the instruments have failed us, we have no way of telling our position. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I stare intently at the black ends of the shafts, but without a pointer they are meaningless. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The control-room mate fumbles about among the pipelines by flashlight. Apparently trying to reach some valve that will close off the spurting stream of water. He's soaked to the skin before he finds it. Although the flow is choked off, he continues to feel about on the floor Suddenly he's holding a pointer. Cautiously he lifts his precious find and places it on the square shaft of the small manometer, the one that registers the lowest depths.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It feels as if all our lives depend on whether the thin strip of metal will move or not.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The man takes his hand away. The needle quivers and slowly begins to turn. Silently the Commander nods approbation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The manometer shows six hundred feet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The hydrophone man reports, "Sounds getting louder-two hundred thirty degrees-two hundred twenty degrees!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander takes his cap off and lays it on the chart chest. His hair is matted with sweat. He takes a deep breath and says, "Keep it up!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For once his voice isn't entirely under control. There is an unmistakable undertone of resignation in it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Noises bearing two hundred ten degrees! Growing louder-attack beginning again!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander immediately orders full speed ahead. A sharp jolt runs through the boat as it leaps forward. The Commander leans against the shining oily column of the sky periscope, resting the back of his head on it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Long-forgotten images rise in my mind: two cardboard disks painted in spirals and spinning in opposite directions on the ice cream machines at country fairs. The tangle of red and white completely fills my head and becomes the trail of two depth charges, flaring comets that consume everything in a blaze of white.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The hydrophone operator startles me. Another report. I stare at his mouth, but his words don't penetrate.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	More waiting, more holding my breath. Even the smallest sound is painful, a touch on a raw wound. As if my nerves had escaped the outer layer of skin and were now exposed. I have only one thought: they're up there. Right overhead. I forget to breathe. I'm stifling before I slowly, cautiously, fill my lungs with oxygen. Against closed eyelids I see bombs tumbling perpendicularly into the depths trailing sparkling air bubbles, exploding into fire. Around their incandescent cores all the colors of the spectrum flare up in mad combinations, leaping and dying again but growing steadily more intense until the whole interior of the sea glows like a blast furnace.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The control-room mate breaks the spell. Gesturing and whispering, he calls the Chiefs attention to a corner of the control room where a can of lubricating oil is overflowing. This is about the most trivial problem imaginable right now, but it upsets him.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The chief nods permission for him to do something about it. The pipe that is dripping oil reaches straight into the can. He can't simply take the can away from under it, but has to tilt it to get it out. As a result, more oil spills onto the floor plates and forms an ugly black puddle.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The navigator shakes his head in disgust. The control-room mate withdraws the overfilled can as cautiously as a thief trying to avoid setting off a burglar alarm.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Corvette noises receding astern!" reports the operator. Almost simultaneously, two more bombs explode. But the roar of the detonations is weaker and duller than before.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Way off," says the Commander.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<i>Rwumm-tjummwumm!</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Even fainter. The Commander seizes his cap. "Practice maneuvers! That's the sort of thing they ought to work on at home!"
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The control-room mate is already busy fitting new glass tubes into the broken water gauges; he seems to know that the mere sight of the breakage affects us like poison.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When I stand up, I'm stiff all over. No feeling in my legs. I try to put one foot in front of the other-feels like stepping into the void. I hold fast to the table and look at the chart.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	There is the pencil line showing the boat's course, and the pencil cross indicating its last position. And here the line suddenly stops—I’m going to make a note of the latitude and longitude of the place if we get out of this.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The operator sweeps the whole circumference of his dial.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Well?" asks the Commander. He acts bored, pushing his tongue into his left cheek till it bulges.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"Going away!" the operator replies.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Commander looks around. Satisfaction personified. He even grins. "As far as I can see, gentlemen, the incident is over."
	</p>
