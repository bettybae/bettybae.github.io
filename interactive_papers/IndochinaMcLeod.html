It is sufficient to note that Ang Duong did not make any clear call for protection. A letter that he sent to Napoleon following Montigny’s visit expressed the hope that France might arrange for the return of Cambodian territories held by the Vietnamese. It did not offer to submit to French control in return.<b>[48]</b><br><br> From Cambodia, Montigny went on to Viet-Nam. The atmosphere  of farce continued, for he arrived so late at Tourane (modern Da-Nang) that the French ships that were to reinforce his exhortation to the Vietnamese not to persecute missionaries had already departed. A foreboding of tragedy, however, tinged the farce. Before Montigny arrived, French ships had shelled forts in Touraine in an effort to intimidate the Vietnamese and so to prevent them from persecuting missionaries. The Vietnamese court might have taken this as a warning of the need to make some future adjustment to the French. Because of Montigny’s late arrival, French prestige sank to a low ebb, and despite the earlier shelling it appeared to the Hue court that they could ignore the interests of the European powers.<br><br> The mandarins were wrong. The pace of Western imperialist activity in China was accelerating, with France seeking desperately to gain a share of expected rich markets. In Paris commercial expectation and imperial perial ambition were added to the hopes of the Church. This blending of interests resulted in two developments of capital importance for the commencement of French colonial endeavor in Viet-Nam. First, France joined with Britain, in 1857, in asserting the position of the European powers dealing with China. A series of incidents had brought conflict between the Chinese imperial authorities and European traders and missionaries. The execution of a French missionary led to the decision in Paris that France should take part in a joint expedition with British.<b>[49]</b> <b>(p. 29)</b>  Secondly, while French forces were committed to this venture, there was an important change in attitudes in Paris. Originally as the result of missionary initiative, the French government once again considered the question of intervention in Viet-Nam. A Committee on Cochinchina-the term used in this case to describe the whole of Viet-Nam-was established, and for reasons of religion, trade, and imperial prestige a strong recommendation was made to establish some form of protectorate over Viet-Nam, which would assure French interests of all sorts there. With Napoleon III convinced of the rightness of the Committee’s decisions, the die was cast for French intervention.<b>[50]</b><br><br> Again, there is ample published commentary on the slow progress of the French forces once they were committed to Viet-Nam in 1858.<b>[51]</b> It was soon apparent that major difficulties attended an attempt to assume a position at Tourane. Divergences quickly developed between the military leadership and the missionaries. The help that the missionaries had promised from Vietnamese Christians, eager to demonstrate their gratitude to those who came to defend their faith, was not forthcoming. The weakness of the Vietnamese army and its lack of modern equipment with which to face the French and Spanish soldiers-for a small Spanish force had joined the crusade to uphold the Catholic faith-was a factor in French favor. But it was offset to a considerable extent by the remarkably firm organization of the Vietnamese mandarins, who showed themselves well able to control the population in a time of crisis, and by the costly toll of lives that the Vietnamese climate and tropical diseases exacted from the invaders.<br><br> Unable to make substantial progress at Tourane, the French next looked to the south and  to Saigon. In contrast to Tourane, this site seemed worth holding. It was already an  important trade center, and the French navl observers also reacted to the undoubted richness of the  land they saw about them, convinced that it offered the prospect of profitable European settlement. Although a French position  was established at Saigon in 1859, the expeditionary troops could do little more than hold on to the area immediately about their camp until major reinforcements were provided in late 1860." 48.

Marc W. McLeod, <i>The Vietnamese Response to French Intervention, 1862-1874</i> (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1991)<br><br>

<b>(p.41)</b><br><br>
<center><b>3</b></center><br><br>
<center><b>The Franco-Spanish Invasion and the Treaty of Saigon, 1858-1862</b></center><br><br>

The previous two chapters developed the concept that, during the 1802-1858 period, the Nguyen emperors practiced a consistent pattern of response to Western--most often, French--intervention. This pattern may be summarized as follows: The Nguyen emperors resisted French pressure by limiting commercial and diplomatic contacts, trying to purge Vietnam of the Catholic missionaries and to prohibit the religion they taught, and by responding in kind to French military aggression. This chapter attempts to explain why, by spring of 1862, the Tu-duc Emperor was compelled to abandon these traditional responses to French intervention. The first topic to be addressed is France's changing policy regarding Vietnam. Specifically, the following question is to be explored: Why, in 1857, did French Emperor Napoleon III decide to order an invasion of Vietnam? This is followed by a consideration of the objective military situation during the 1858-1862 war, after which the scope of the official elite's subjective responses to this situation are outlined. The discussion of the 1858-1862 period closes with an intervention in the debate among modem Vietnamese historians of the Sai-gon school about the position of the Tu-duc Emperor regarding the 1862 accords. Specifically, the question of the relative responsibility of Tu-duc and Vietnamese negotiator Phan Thanh Gian for the 1862 document, which granted France substantial territorial, commercial, political, and religious privileges in Vietnam, is addressed. It is argued that Emperor Tu-duc himself, in order to escape from what had become a desperate military situation, approved of Phan Thanh Gian's signing of the Treaty of Sai-gon, which therefore represents a significant historical break with the traditional Nguyen response to French intervention.<br><br>

From the inception of his reign in 1852, Emperor Napoleon III had been pressured by a variety of groups to take a harder line with the Vietnamese state. Church representatives had long advocated an <b>(p.42)</b> activist foreign policy in support of their interests in Vietnam. Indeed, the most determined and persistent of the pro-interventionist militants were undoubtedly the missionaries of the Societe des Mission-Etrangeres, particularly Pellerin, Retord, Libois, and Huc.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> The Church groups' arguments were echoed, with differences in nuance, by the Ministry of the Navy, where bitter regrets over the loss of France's American empire in the eighteenth century were giving birth to exaggerated hopes for a new and greater nineteenth-century empire in Asia.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> French naval officers active in China waters, among them Cecille, Rocquemaurel, Jaures, Fourichon, and Maison-neuve, were the first to propose a conquest of Vietnam to the French emperor. Many of the French diplomats stationed at Macao, such as Forth, Rouen, De Courcy and Bourboulon, joined their voices to this colonialist cacophony.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a><br><br>

In April 1857 Napoleon III appointed a special committee--La Commission de la Cochinchine--to investigate the question of intervention.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> The committee members--Baron Brennier, its chairman; Admiral Fourichon; Ship's Captain Jaures; and Count Fleury, who represented the French Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture--met from May 3, 1857 until August 10, 1858.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> Many missionaries were called to testify among them Huc and Pellerin. The latter did not limit his testimony to the religious aspect. He emphasized also the necessity for France to act quickly to obtain strategic and commercial bases in this part of the world, bases to which, he claimed, France was entitled according to the terms of the 1787 treaty. Pellerin further emphasized the relative ease with which the operation could be accomplished, given the massive support that he alleged "the indigenous Catholics would bring to their French liberators. He urged the French government to occupy Vietnam and to capture the Vietnamese monarch, who, Pellerin supposed, would die in the process. This, the prelate continued, would leave the French free to govern the country through a successor of their own choosing and with an administration built upon a "spinal column" of Vietnamese Catholics.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> The members of the commission were obliged to admit that the 1787 treaty had not been implemented by Louis XVI's government. Nevertheless the commission's members insisted that France had a moral right to compensation since French officers had helped Nguyen Phuc Anh to win the Vietnamese throne. They concluded that the time had come for France to join in "the movement of progress, civilization, and commercial expansion of which China was going to be the theater." The commission urged that the issue of religious persecution in Vietnam be put to good use as the justification for the establishment of a solid French presence in the Far East. To this end they recommended that France obtain a protectorate over the territory of Vietnam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a><br><br>

In approving the recommendations of La Commission de la Cochinchine, Napoleon III's motivations were several. The question of France's opposition to the "persecution" of Catholic missionaries <b>(p.43)</b> in Vietnam was significant primarily in domestic political terms. Napoleon III could not have established and maintained his regime without the support of the French Catholics; the protection of missionaries in distant lands was a relatively inexpensive quid pro quo.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> But the religious factor alone was not sufficient to stir the French government to intervene. In the words of Milton Osborne the additional elements of "imperial ambition and commercial opportunity" were also necessary before Napoleon III could be convinced of the desirability of mounting an expedition against Vietnam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> The French emperor found it expedient to support the interests of manufacturing and exporting groups in their pursuit of markets for their goods and raw materials for their factories. Another important domestic consideration was what may be termed the "prestige factor" of colonies, that is, the domestic political benefits that a European government could hope to derive from imperialistic adventures. This factor was particularly active in France because Napoleon III was intent on creating an overseas empire as a manifestation of his imperial legitimacy and his ability to advance perceived French interests in competition with other European powers. As long as they were successfully undertaken and not too costly, such adventures were popular with the masses and assured his regime the support of military officers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> The latter were of course, especially concerned with the strategic advantages vis-a-vis competing European powers--particularly England--that successful colonization could bring. French intervention in Vietnam was, of course, legitimized. In the name of opposition to the "persecution" of Catholic missionaries by the Hue court, but the above considerations indicate that the question of "persecution" was merely a screen behind which were concealed more mundane considerations--domestic politics, dynastic prestige, economics, and international competition.<br><br>

A combined Franco-Spanish expeditionary force assembled in Da-nang harbor on August 31, 1858. The French component was 2,500 troops and thirteen warships; Spanish forces from the Philippines contributed one warship and 450 colonial troops.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> The French commander, Rigault de Genouilly, planned to destroy the Vietnamese defenses at Da-nang harbor with lightning speed after which an overland attack on Hue was to be launched. Once the imperial capital fell, it was believed, the will to resist of the entire country would be broken.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> The European assault began on September 1, 1858 but was soon halted by the defensive tactics of the Vietnamese commander, Nguyen Tri Phuong, who sealed off the invaders by constructing an elaborate system of trenches and walls. Local geography facilitated defense, for the region's rivers were too shallow to permit the heavy European craft to penetrate the interior to support the troops in the planned assault on Hue.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> After five months of fierce combat, the Franco-Spanish forces controlled little more than an uninhabited stretch of shore. The contest seemed to be a stalemate, and all hopes for dealing the Hue court a <i>coup de <b></i>(p.44)<i></b> grâce</i> from Da-nang were abandoned by the European officers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> The deadlock was a costly one for the invaders because cholera had broken out among the Franco-Spanish soldiers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a><br><br>

Rigault de Genouilly decided to take advantage of the mobile firepower of his fleet in order to shift the brunt of his attack to southernmost Vietnam, known to contemporary Vietnamese as the <i><i>luc tinh</i></i> or "Six Provinces."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> From the point of view of the French commander, the <i>luc tinh</i> offered numerous advantages. Hue's dependence on southern rice raised the possibility of a blockade.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> The region's deep and penetrating rivers would permit his troops to attack Vietnamese strongpoints under the cover of his shipboard guns. Once entrenched in the <i>luc tinh</i>, the French commander could hope to counter British influence in Thailand, while persuading Thailand itself and Cambodia to oppose Vietnam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> Furthermore, the <i>luc tinh</i> were intrinsically more desirable a target than was Da-nang to the French commander, for the region around Sai-gon was already an important trade center.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a><br><br>

Leaving one-third of his soldiers in defensive positions at Da-nang, de Genouilly sent the remaining two-thirds on his fourteen warships to the <i>luc tinh</i>. Their offensive opened on February 10, 1859 with a bombardment of Vung Tau. Within six days the European ships had destroyed twelve Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers, which permitted them to attack the citadel of Gia-dinh with their shipboard guns at point-blank range.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> The citadel fell after only two days, and the retreating Vietnamese forces left behind large stores of grain, munitions, and silver. Informed that the small Franco-Spanish holding force at Da-nang was in serious danger of being overrun, de Genouilly left a small contingent in the <i>luc tinh</i> and returned to Da-nang, where he was able to force the Vietnamese troops to retreat.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> De Genouilly then offered the Hue court a negotiated settlement along the lines of the "unequal treaties" that had been extorted from the Chinese Qing court, but there was no clear response before he fell ill and was replaced by Admiral Page. Page continued to press Hue for such a settlement.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a><br><br>

At this point a substantial portion of the French force in Vietnam was withdrawn to participate in the operations being conducted by Admiral Charner in cooperation with the British navy against China. The Franco-Spanish positions at Da-nang were abandoned and a reduced force of 1,000 men was left in the <i>luc tinh</i> under the command of Colonel d'Aries.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> The Hue court dispatched Nguyen Tri Phuong and Pham The Hien to take command of the Vietnamese armies in the <i>luc tinh</i>. They constructed a defensive system at Ky-hoa (known in French texts as Chi-hoa), which the Franco-Spanish troops unsuccessfully attempted to breach on several occasions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a><br><br>

In the spring of 1861 the Franco-British expedition was successfully completed in China, releasing an important French force (seventy vessels, 3,500 troops) under Admiral Charner for action against Vietnam.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> On February 23, 1861 the reinforced <b>(p.45)</b> Franco-Spanish troops launched their attack on the Ky-hoa defensive complex, which they overran after two days of bloody fighting. After the fall of Ky-hoa the Hue court's regular forces were no longer able to stand up to the European onslaught, and the provincial citadels and strongpoints of the <i>luc tinh</i> were successively overpowered: The prefecture of Tan-binh fell on February 28, 1861; the citadel of Dinh-tuong on April 12, 1861; and the citadel of Vinh-Iong on February 23, 1862.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> With the decline in the capacity. of the Vietnamese regular forces in the South, the bulk of the fighting was assumed by irregular forces. These irregulars harassed Franco-Spanish units in rural zones where the latter were thinly spread but were incapable of challenging them in the captured Citadels and administrative centers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a><br><br>
 
What was the role of the Vietnamese Catholics during the Franco-Spanish invasion? The question deserves a separate monograph, but here it may be worthwhile to respond briefly to the arguments of a number of modern historians who have affirmed that the Vietnamese Catholics did not support or join with the Franco-Spanish troops at Da-nang in 1858-1859.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> In fact, French archival sources show clearly that, as early as September 1858, groups of Tonkinese Catholics began·to reach the embattled European armies. Rigault de Genouilly formed the men into two indigenous detachments and trained them at a camp that he established for this purpose at Tien-cha. One of these detachments fought alongside the Franco-Spanish soldiers at Da-nang; the other went southward to participate in the invasion of the <i>luc tinh</i> and fought in the battle of Ky-hoa.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> After the battle of Ky-hoa, the indigenous Catholic militiamen who entered the service of the Europeans at Da-nang continued to serve the French in the occupied south as soldiers, interpreters, coolies, and guides.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> They were rewarded for their services by Admiral-Governor de la Grandiere, who granted them concessions of land in the Sai-gon area.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> <br><br>

That the number of Vietnamese Catholics who fought for the Europeans at Da-nang was not greater is probably due to the fact that the Franco-Spanish units, because of missionary misinformation and their own strategic stupidity, found themselves isolated on the central coastline, cut off by Vietnamese troops from all but naval communication. Geographical factors contributed to this isolation: Most rivers in central Vietnam were too shallow to be penetrated by the heavy European warships. Furthermore, missionary Catholicism in Vietnam had historically had more success in obtaining conversions in the North and the South than in the center. Thus, the European armies were searching for indigenous allies in the very region in which they were least likely to find them. Nevertheless, since the Franco-Spanish invaders found enough Vietnamese Catholic fighters at Da-nang to form two detachments, the arguments that a number of modern historians have made for a lack of Catholic support for the invasion of Da-nang stand in need of revision. <br><br>

During the Franco-Spanish invasion of 1858-1862, the Tu-duc Emperor's interdictions of Catholicism grew increasingly severe and comprehensive. This was primarily because the Hue court believed that the Vietnamese Catholics supported the invading armies. The wartime edicts were thus largely directed to the problem of preventing the Vietnamese Catholics from communicating with the Franco-Spanish forces. An edict of May 1859, for example, stated that, upon hearing of the fall of the Sai-gon citadel, the Vietnamese Catholics of the South were taking advantage of the situation in order to terrorize the luong or "good" (that is, non-Catholic) people and to serve as "lackeys and spies for the Westerners [tay sai va mat tham cho Tay-duong]." The edict ordered that the relatives of any Catholic who was working for the invaders be taken as hostages until the culpable party surrendered to Vietnamese authorities. Catholics suspected of having contacts with the Westerners were to be imprisoned as a preventative measure. Catholics who displayed a "wait and see attitude [va van, trong ngong]" regarding the invaders were to be placed under the surveillance of non-Catholic villages.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> An edict of 1861 specified that imprisoned Catholics were to be executed if the prison in which they were held was in danger of being seized by the Europeans. Another edict in the same year ordered that incarcerated Catholics who refused to recant were to be executed by choking.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> As for those Catholics who remained in their villages, the court ordered that their taxes be doubled in order to pay for military expenses.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> The severity of these wartime edicts was justified, in the emperor's opinion, because the Catholics had "brought the Westerners into the country."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> <br><br>

Despite the seeming severity and comprehensiveness of these measures, scholars have pointed out the existence of what may be termed a "persecution gap" or difference between the letter of the edicts and their implementation at the local level. This observation is applicable to the period before the 1858-1862 war as well. To cite a few instances, in 1848 the Xa-doai seminary in Nghe-an province was still operating openly; Bishop Gauthier invited Nguyen Truong To, the great Catholic scholar and reformist, there to teach.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> And in 1861 the Tu-duc Emperor degraded in rank and transferred two high-level officials in Quang-binh province--Nguyen Van Ung and Ta Huu Khue--when it was discovered that they had permitted two Vietnamese Catholics to move freely about the province in exchange for the preparation of medicines for use by the officials' families.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> Conversely, an official in Nam-dinh province claimed in 1862 that 4,800 Catholics had been executed by imperial officials there in the previous year alone.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> In the absence of more precise, reliable, and comprehensive documentation, judgment must be withheld regarding the actual impact of official anti-Catholicism both before and during the 1858-1862 conflict. With the existing documentation it can only be concluded that the imperial court believed that the Catholics were aiding the French and Spanish troops and that the court was not entirely wrong in this perception. Accordingly, the Tu-duc <b>(p.47)</b> Emperor's wartime anti-Catholic edicts reached new extremes of severity primarily in order to keep the indigenous Catholics from linking with the invading forces. Despite the emperor's intention to deal severely with the Catholics, the inclinations of local officials determined the manner in which the court's edicts were implemented; the severity of the edicts was thus in some cases mitigated.<br><br>

How can the Franco-Spanish military success be explained? Most historians have emphasized two objective factors: the technical superiority of European arms, particularly the naval superiority that permitted the French to blockade central Vietnam; and the northern rebellion of a Catholic Le pretender to the Vietnamese throne Pierre Le Duy Phung. It would be useful briefly to consider the nature and impact of these two factors.<br><br>
 
The Europeans who fought against the Vietnamese imperial forces at Da-nang and in the "Six Provinces" during the 1858-1862 conflict were, generally speaking, favorably impressed with the martial and organizational qualities of their opponents.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a> Hue's regular forces did, after all, keep the Franco-Spanish invaders at bay for more than three and one-half years. The Vietnamese army obstructed the intended advance upon the imperial capital of Hue and eventually forced its opponents to withdraw altogether from Da-nang. Nevertheless, the disparity between the technical levels of the European and indigenous forces was significant. Of the 32,000 troops in the Vietnamese army, only 5,000 were equipped with rifles, the rest employIng only spears or sharpened staves.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a> In addition, these rifles were muzzle-loaders with a maximum range of only 300 meters. Loading and firing such weapons was a complicated, time-consuming, and uncertain endeavor.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> And it was an unfamiliar one: Each of the Vietnamese riflemen was only permitted to practice shooting once in a year's time and was allowed only six projectiles for use in battle.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> By comparison, the European breech-loaders were practical, easily operated, and reliable. The Vietnamese army had at its disposal 200 artillery pieces, but these were cumbersome, exceedingly heavy, and prohibitively difficult to transport to the theater of battle or to manipulate after arrival. They were laboriously loaded from the muzzle, and their inaccuracy was such that it was not unusual for them to fire ten rounds without even once hitting their target. European artillery pieces were relatively light and mobile breech-loaders capable of placing their exploding shells with great accuracy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> This disparity in firepower, accuracy, and rapidity of fire was so great as to counterbalance the numerical superiority of the Vietnamese army. Indeed, by mid-1859 Nguyen Tri Phuong informed Emperor Tu-duc from the southern front that so many Vietnamese troops were required to defend against attack that no men could be spared for offensive operations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a> <br><br>

At sea the European technical advantage was even greater. The Vietnamese navy had only seven steamships among its fifty large craft. Suited only to patrolling rivers or to coastal defense against a <b>(p.47)</b> traditional enemy, Hue's sailing ships were technologically incapable of tacking against the wind, and its sailors were utterly inexperienced in maneuvering on the open sea.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> The combined European naval force that attacked Da-nang in September 1858 was only fourteen warships but by February 1861 (that is, after the successful conclusion of the Anglo-French expedition in China) the Franco-Spanish force had seventy vessels at its disposal.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> These were steam-powered warships equally at ease in coastal waters, the deep rivers of the <i>luc tinh</i>, or the open sea.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a> As Nguyen Tn Phuong was forced to concede, the Europeans coordinated naval and terrestrial maneuvers effectively, but the Vietnamese defenders could not possibly carry the war out to sea.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a> This uncontested naval superiority allowed the French to blockade central Vietnam, the specific circumstances of which are now to be examined.<br><br>

The French navy's blockade of central Vietnam significantly reduced the flow of rice to the grain-deficient central provinces during the final years of the war. Indeed, the prospect of isolating the Hue court from the produce of southern Vitetnam's rich rice fields was one of the main reasons that had motivated de Genouilly to shift southward the brunt of his attack. From the inception of the attack on Gia-dinh, French naval vessels had been systematically attacking Vietnamese transport, fishing, and commercial craft all along the coast. They also regularly terrorized peasants and razed villages in the central provinces of Quang-nam and Khanh-hoa.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a> But after the conclusion of the Anglo-French expedition in China, the French forces under Admiral Charner in Vietnam had a sufficient number of vessels to permit them to patrol the coastal waters and deep rivers of southern Vietnam in order to intercept shipments of rice from the <i>luc tinh</i> to Hue.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> The French strategy in blockading Hue was summarized in a letter from Minister of the Navy and Colonies Chasseloup-Laubat to Admiral Charner in July 1861, which further ordered that the blockade be tightened by intercepting Vietnamese vessels traveling from Tonkin to Hue as well. The document reads: <br><br>

<blockquote>I can only give my complete approval to the order by which you have established a blockade on the various routes used for the exportation of rice from the territories of Sai-gon and My-tho. Obviously, we will only obtain the peace and the concessions that we desire by making the Hue court understand that it would be better for it to abandon to us our conquests--while continuing to come there for trade--than to plunge into a struggle that will reduce those who remain under Hue's authority to misery and perhaps to famine. The blockade must therefore be effective and severe. We should not limit it to the rivers of Cambodia and Sai-gon; if possible, it should prevent ships carrying foodstuffs to Hue from entering the river of that city. It is not only from the provinces of SaI-gon and My-tho that the Hue court must draw the necessary foodstuffs; it must also have them from Tonkin.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a></blockquote>
 
<b>(p.49)</b> While precise statistics with which to measure the impact of these measures are lacking, there are several indications that the population was indeed adversely affected and that this was a source of concern for the court. In the spring of 1860 Ho doc Bui Quy, responsible for Binh thuan and Phu-yen, reported to Hue that "the sea routes are perturbed, very little rice reaches us from the South, and the price of rice is higher each day."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> The impact of the blockade--and the failure of efforts to circumvent it--are further discussed in a funeral oration for Phan Thanh Gian written in late 1867 by Pham Phu Thu, a native of Quang-nam province who had held a ministerial post at Hue and had traveled to France as a member of Phan Thanh Gian's negotiating team. According to this document the deprivations caused by the blockade coincided with an unfortuitous period of drought. The drought and the blockade "drained the treasury and exhausted the state." According to Pham Phu Thu, this situation made the emperor "worried and miserable," while the military and civil mandarins were "ashamed" of their inability to provide a solution. Alternative means for transportation of foodstuffs were attempted but to no avail: "We constructed trails in the mountains and changed river transportation routes, but this had no effect on supply. Money and provisions were lacking, and the people went hungry."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a><br><br>

The French officers were therefore aware of the fact that the Vietnamese capital at Hue and its surrounding provinces were dependent on the rice-exporting northern and southern extremities of the country, and they sought to employ their superior naval forces to block the transportation of grain from these areas. The goal, as Chasseloup-Laubat stated, was to demonstrate to the Hue court that continued resistance would bring widespread "misery" and possibly "famine" for central Vietnamese. Through their blockade, attacks on transport, commercial, and fishing vessels, and attacks on coastal settlements far from the battlefields of Nam-ky, the French navy was successful in increasing the human cost of the conflict for the Vietnamese.<br><br>

Perhaps the most important factor in rendering Hue's continued resistance to the Franco-Spanish invaders increasingly problematic was the rebellion of the Catholic Le pretender, Pierre Le Duy Phung. What factors made the Tonkin area fertile ground for such a rebellion, and how did this movement affect the Hue court's ability to resist the Europeans?<br><br>

It was described earlier how, in 1802, Gia-Iong divided his empire for administrative purposes into three zones: a central zone of provinces (<i>tinh</i> or <i>doanh</i>) administered by centrally appointed officials; and southern and northern military defense zones (<i>tran</i>) administered under the authority of relatively autonomous military protectors (<i>tong-tran</i>). Minh-menh's centralization of the early 1830s provoked a regional rebellion in Gia-dinh during the years 1833-1835. Nor was the administrative incorporation of Tonkin a simple matter, for the traditional Tonkinese fondness for the Le <b>(p.50)</b> dynastic house as well as the strong Catholic presence in the region provided powerful mobilizing elements for regional rebellion. The socio-cultural roots of the Tonkinese sympathy for the Le dynastic house have never been thoroughly studied, but it may be suggested that these sentiments were due in part to an idealized memory of the magnificent political and cultural achievements of the early Le monarchs in the fifteenth century. This image of the early Le period as a "golden age" would not necessarily have been tarnished by the pusillanimity of subsequent Le rulers, for the northern people apparently blamed the feuding Trinh and Nguyen chua houses for the Le family's captivity as well as for their own suffering during the long civil war that culminated in the 1802 reunification. Partly out of respect for these sentiments, Gia-Iong had treated the region gingerly after reunification: Its tax quotas were lower than those of the center; and the military protectors installed by the Nguyen founder were careful to leave local social and political structures undisturbed. When Minh-menh's centralization brought higher taxes and the more uniform system of authority imposed by Hue's bureaucrats local discontent often took the form of movements to install an alleged descendant of the Le emperors on the Vietnamese throne. By the time of the Franco-Spanish invasion of 1858, Hue's forces had already suppressed, with little difficulty, a number of such movements among them that of Le Duy Luong during the reign of Minh-menh and that of Le Duy Cu under Tu-duc in 1854. But the most murderous and politically significant of all the Le-inspired northern regional rebellions against the Nguyen dynasty's authority was started in Tonkin in 1861 by a Catholic Le pretender named Pierre Le Duy Phung.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a><br><br>

Little is known about Pierre Le Duy Phung's background except that he was from an early age, the protege of the Catholic missionaries, who took him to their seminary in Penang where he was baptized and raised a Catholic.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a> Probably at the instigation of his protectors he had requested, in 1855, French support for an anti-Nguyen rebellion, in return for which he had offered broad concessions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a> Unable to secure the needed assistance, Pierre Le Duy Phung bade his time until August 1858 when the Franco-Spanish expedition landed at Da-nang. Thanks to the intercession of Father Legrand de la Lyraye, Pierre Le Duy Phung was engaged (under the name of Ta Van Phung) as a mercenary with the invaders whom he served as a translator.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> But the pretender apparently devoted more effort to propagandizing his own cause among the French officers and their Vietnamese collaborators at Da-nang than to his translation duties. Pierre Le Duy Phung's dynastic preoccupations were not appreciated by the French commander Rigault de Genouilly, who, by 1859, had his sights set on Sai-gon and would not hear of the pretender's proposals for a tripartite (that is, Franco-Spanish-Le) northern expedition. Confronted with the adamant refusal of the French officer, Pierre Le Duy Phung left the service of the Europeans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a><br><br>

Pierre Le Duy Phung reappeared in 1861 in Tonkin where, under the name of Le Duy Minh, he headed a movement of rebellion against Nguyen authority. Advocating pro-Catholic and Le-Iegitimist programs, Pierre Le Duy Phung assembled under his banner a motley alliance of Tonkinese Catholics, Le dynastic partisans, and Chinese and Vietnamese coastal pirates.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a> The support of the latter groups was particularly useful, for they supplied him with munitions in exchange for local products and plunder, and they protected him from Hue's navy, which was, in any case, restricted in its movement by French patrols.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a> According to one French observer, Charles Duval, Pierre Le Duy Phung commanded at the pinnacle of his success an army of approximately 20,000 soldiers who dominated regions--primarily the Tonkinese litoral provinces of Quang-yen, Hai-duong, and Nam-dinh, their capitals excepted--containing from 150,000 to 200,000 inhabitants.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> At the instigation of the missionaries, Pierre Le Duy Phung sent early in 1862 an ambassador to Sai-gon to request yet another time the aid of the French, in return for which he promised to establish after victory a "theocratic kingdom" under the protection of France. Spanish commander Palanca looked favorably upon the pretender's proposition but was overruled by Admiral Bonard, who considered Pierre Le Duy Phung to be an illegitimate claimant and an unreliable potential ally.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> <br><br>

In any event Bonard was able to derive the full benefit of the diversion created by the "second front" of the Tonkinese rebellion without having to commit any resources to its support. In May 1862 (that is, at the very moment during which Vietnamese emissaries Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep were arriving at Sai-gon to begin negotiations) Pierre Le Duy Phung was mounting his forces for a decisive attack on the former Le capital at Ke-cho (known as Thang-Iong in Le times; modern Ha-noi) that would have severed the Hue court's administrative ties to Tonkin. It is improbable that the imperial forces could have repelled the pretender's armies without bringing reinforcements from the southern front--which would have been impossible without a negotiated settlement of the war with the Europeans.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> According to Paulin Vial, a participant in the Sai-gon negotiations, the European officers at Sai-gon were kept well informed by Tonkinese Catholics of Hue's northern predicament.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a> Only in 1864, after the full weight of the imperial military machine led by Hue's finest generals had been brought to bear on the Le claimant's troops, was the rebellion finally suppressed.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a> But the second front created by Pierre Le Duy Phung's Catholic-supported Tonkinese rebellion makes it an important objective factor that rendered more difficult Hue's continued resistance to the invading European armies. <br><br>

How was the Franco-Spanish onslaught perceived by the Vietnamese elite, and what responses did they propose? From the inception of the attack on Da-nang, the Hue court was split into two factions that are designated in Vietnamese as <i>chu chien</i> and <i>chu hoa</i>. These terms may be rendered in English as, respectively, "advocates <b>(p.51)</b> of war" and "advocates of peace," and their positions may be briefly described as follows.<br><br>

The advocates of war were represented at court by Nguyen Tri Phuong, Hoang Dieu, Hoang Ta Viem, and Ton That Thuyet. Their advocacy of continued resistance to Franco-Spanish arms was based on the Confucian conception that the righteous man is obligated to fulfill his duty regardless of the consequences as well as upon the traditional tenacity of the Vietnamese, who often preferred death to servitude.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> The Confucian hard-liners who composed the chu chien group at court were among the most unyielding of the mandarins on the Catholic question, insisting that Hue's interdictions of Christianity be maintained and extended, often going as far as to demand that the Vietnamese Catholics be completely eliminated.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a> In regard to strategy and tactics the chu chien group, facing a technologically superior enemy and unable or unwilling to envision the possibility of a mass resistance, was compelled to advocate a continued reliance on defensive measures such as building walls, digging trenches, and holding fortresses against European attacks. Despite their obvious physical courage, the chu chien officials lacked confidence and a resolute will to victory. Their actions were thus often based less on working toward eventual success than on sacrificing themselves as a means of retaining their moral purity (tiet nghia), as the example of Vu Duy Ninh, who committed suicide rather than surrender the Gia-dinh citadel to the invaders, illustrates.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-68">[68]</a><br><br>

In terms of evaluating the enemy's intentions, the arguments of the <i>chu chien</i> officials were more penetrating than those of the advocates of peace. While the latter denied that territorial aggrandizement was a long-range goal for the invaders, the advocates of war argued that French activities in the South were a clear sign that they indeed harbored territorial ambitions. For example, Nguyen Tri Phuong protested to the emperor as early as the fall of 1860 that French plans were revealed by their implantation of an administrative and fiscal system in the South, by the extensive cartographical work that the French navy had conducted on the southern river communications system, and by their efforts to establish commercial and political relations with Gia-dinh's large Chinese population.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a> The astute Nguyen Tri Phuong also foresaw that any plans that the advocates of peace at court may have had for peaceful relations with an occupying authority in the South would run aground on the southern population's refusal to accept the new regime.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a><br><br>

The advocates of peace were represented at court by Phan Thanh Gian, Nguyen Ba Nghi, Truong Dang Que, and Lam Duy Hiep. Their position in favor of a negotiated settlement with the invaders was based on an empirical

Their position in favor of a negotiated settlement with the invaders was based on an empirical recognition of the superiority of European weapons and a Confucian compassion for the sufferings that continued resistance would bring the Vietnamese people.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> The terrible effectiveness of European weaponry was described in the <b>(p.52)</b> following fashion by Nguyen Ba Nghi, sent by the Tu-duc Emperor in 1861, that is, after the fall of Sai-gon and Dinh-tuong, to investigate the situation in the South:<br>

<blockquote>Previously, I had heard that the Western ships move so fast that they seem to be flying, that their guns can penetrate walls of stone, that they can strike from a distance of tens of miles, but I could not believe it possible. In the seventh year of Thieu-tri when the Western ships sank five of our bronze-plated ships in the wink of an eye, I held the post of chief mandarin of the military bureau of Quang-nam. I was thus able to witness these events with my own eyes. Only then did I believe what I had heard about the military prowess of the Westerners. At present it is evident that our people did not properly take stock of our own strength when we set out to resist them for so long a period; because of this error, we must now suffer defeat. I have come to Bien-hoa, and I observe that the situation on all fronts is extremely dangerous and pressing for us. In truth, my humble opinion is that we can neither attack nor resist, and only by making peace can we hope to stabilize the overall situation.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a></blockquote>

For the proponents of peace the superiority of Franco-Spanish weapons rendered the invaders' victory inevitable; to continue the struggle would needlessly prolong the misery of the population. Thus, chu hoa arguments for a negotiated peace made constant reference to the necessity of gaining for the common people a respite from the war's destruction and an opportunity to return to agricultural pursuits.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> <br><br>

In part the arguments of the advocates of peace were based on an erroneous assessment of French interests. These officials believed that the physical distance of France from Vietnam and the predominantly commercial orientations of the French meant that territorial gain was not a long-range goal for the invaders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> This interpretation of Western intentions was, for <i>chu hoa</i> mandarins, confirmed by the example of the recent Western aggressions in China. There the Westerners did not·consummate their <i>coups de force</i> by taking possession of large portions of Chinese territory; rather, they seemed content to extort political, religious, and commercial concessions from the Qing court.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a> Furthermore, these officials argued, if the mighty Central Kingdom had been humbled by Western arms, how could tiny Vietnam hope to defy such invaders?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a> Finally, the proponents of peace were less uncompromising on the religious question. Phan Thanh Gian illustrates well this aspect of the <i>chu hoa</i> position. Although he had no sympathy for the Catholic religion or its followers, he maintained that the severe interdictions of Nguyen times had no precedent in Le or Tran times, concluding that the issue should not constitute an obstacle to peace negotiations.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> <br><br>

<b>(p.53)</b> From its inception as a minority faction at court, the <i>chu hoa</i> group gradually grew larger and more influential. By the spring of 1862 the advocates of peace had become dominant at court and had won the support of Tu-duc.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a> The emperor accordingly acceded to the Franco-Spanish demands that the Hue court send plenipotentiaries to negotiate a treaty of "peace and friendship" with the European representatives in a region of Vietnam occupied by Franco-Spanish forces. He further accepted the Franco-Spanish demands that Hue pay the sum of 10,000 ligatures as an initial payment for a "compensation" clause to be negotiated as part of a comprehensive settlement.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> On May 16, 1862 Emperor Tu-duc appointed two supporters of the <i>chu hoa</i> tendency, Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hlep, to represent Vietnam in negotiations with the triumphant invaders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a> The emissaries arrived in Sai-gon on May 24, 1862 with an entourage of 133 persons, and negotiations began two days later.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a> By June 5, 1862 they had signed the "unequal treaty" that in Vietnamese is known as the <i>Hoa-uoc Nham-tuat</i> (Treaty of the year of <i>Nham-tuat</i>) and in English as the Treaty of 1862 or as the Treaty of Sai-gon.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a> <br><br>

If there is general agreement among Vietnam specialists on the factors that motivated the Tu-duc Emperor and the chu hoa mandarins to agree to negotiate an "unequal treaty" with France and Spain, the question of the emperor's precise position regarding the scope and nature of the concessions to be granted has yet to be definitively answered. Nguyen The Anh and Pham Van Son have suggested that Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep exceeded their instructions, going beyond what the Tu-duc Emperor had in mind when they granted France the religious and territorial concessions contained in the 1862 accords.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a> Evidence for such an argument can be found in the Vietnamese imperial records, which indicate that on the eve of departure to join negotiations in Sai-gon the Vietnamese emissaries were formally directed by the emperor to grant most of the commercial and diplomatic concessions demanded by the Europeans. But on the questions of religious freedom and territorial cessions, the emperor was apparently adamant: "Territory must absolutely not be granted; freedom to preach the heretical religion must absolutely not be granted."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a> <br><br>

Yet the Vietnamese negotiators granted major concessions in both these areas: Article II of the 1862 treaty specified that the Catholic religion could be freely followed throughout Vietnam; article III granted France governmental authority in the three eastern provinces of southern Vietnam--Gia-dinh, Dinh-tuong, and Bien-hoa; article X forbade the Hue court to send any military materiel into these three provinces.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> When the news of these stipulations reached Hue, the two ambassadors were severely criticized by Tu-duc Emperor, who declared: "These two officials are not only criminals with regard to the present court, but they are also criminals with regard to one thousand generations."<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a> <br><br>

Did the Vietnamese emissaries actually exceed their instructions <b>(p.55)</b> in granting the territorial and religious concessions stipulated in articles II and III of the Treaty of Sai-gon? Is It not possible that the emperor, resigned to ending the war at all costs, secretly authorized his emissaries to make the necessary concessions, taking care that other officials--including the imperial historians--would remain ignorant of these instructions? If this were the case, than the emperor's criticisms at court were merely an exercise in scapegoating.<br><br>

While neither French nor Vietnamese sources permit a clear resolution of the problem, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that Emperor Tu-duc, late in 1862, refused to endorse a proposal at court that the actions of his emissaries actually be condemned as criminal sarcastically asking the assembled dignitaries if there were enough "talented and virtuous [hien tai]" officials among them to replace Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep in their functions.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a> Phan Thanh Gian retained his position as Minister of Public Office (<i>Thuong thu Bo Lai</i>) as well as his membership in the emperor's Privy Council (<i>Co mat vien</i>); he was further granted the post of Viceroy and Provincial Adjoint for the Southern Region (<i>Pho su kinh luoc Nam-ky</i>) as well as the posts of chief mandarin for Gia-dinh (<i>Tuan phu Gia-dinh</i>) and Resident Grand Dignitary and Plenipotentiary (<i>Chanh su toan quyen dai than</i>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> And Lam Duy Hiep was appointed chief mandarin (<i>Tuan phu</i>) for the Thuan-khanh region. In the words of the emperor these positions would bring Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep into constant contact with French officials in the occupied South, thereby permitting the two mandarins "to make amends for their crimes [<i>chuoc toi</i>]" by negotiating the rescission of the offensive articles.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a><br><br>

Emperor Tu-duc's reaction to the signing of the 1862 treaty by Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep may thus be summarized as follows: He insulted the emissaries at court, yet he refused to endorse the criminal procedures called for at that time by the chu chien mandarins; he did not repudiate the agreements that his ambassadors had made; and he appointed them to positions that allowed them to continue negotiations with French officials at Gia-dinh and elsewhere.<br><br>

The emperor's reaction to Phan Thanh Gian's surrender of three additional southern provinces and concomitant suicide in 1867 was consistent with this precedent of insulting the emissaries while refusing to repudiate the concessions they had made. After Phan Thanh Gian's suicide and Lam Duy Hiep's death (of natural causes), Tu-duc joined chu chien officials at court in taking revenge on the two ambassadors. A commission of thirty-two dignitaries found Phan Thanh Gian and other officials involved in the loss of the six provinces guilty of negligence in assuming the responsibilities inherent in their positions. In light of Phan Thanh Gian's suicide the dignitaries urged that he be spared the punishment of posthumous decapitation (tram hau).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a> For the emperor this verdict was not severe enough, and he issued an edict in accordance with which Phan <b>(p.55)</b> Thanh Gian, and Lun Duy Hiep's titles, positions, and grades were revoked, then names removed from the monument for civil service examination degree-holders, and their bodies exhumed for decapitation. Tu-duc explained the reasons behind such a severe judgment: 

<blockquote>Phan Thanh Gian, in the capacity of Viceroy, and Lam Duy Hiep, disregarded their responsibilities in the peace negotiations, complacently giving away the three provinces of Gia-dinh, Bien-hoa, and Dinh-tuong; Phan Thanh Gian accepted a royal commission to go on a mission as ambassador, and yet nothing was accomplished; then, again assuming the post of Viceroy, he lost the three provinces of Vinh-long, An-giang, and Ha-tien. Both crimes are serious and, although his death followed, it is not enough to atone for them. Although Phan Thanh Gian and Lam Duy Hiep are dead, they are both to suffer posthumous revocation of titles, positions, and grades; their names are to be chiseled from the stele of the tien si degree-holders; and we leave for one thousand generations the sentence of tram hau. Thus we execute those who are already dead in order to warn those who are still living.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a></blockquote> 

But the "warning" for the living and the message for subsequent generations were ambiguous at best. Tran Quoc Giam, a participant in the scholarly discussion of Phan Thanh Gian's historical role organized by the editors of Sai-gon's <i>Su dia</i> (<i>History and Geography</i>) apparently accepts the emperor's declaration at face value. He finds the document to be a moving statement of chu chien resolution to resist foreign encroachment, and he asserts that Tu-duc's contemporaries found it so as well: <br>

<blockquote>The judgment was satisfying to the hearts of the patriots for the king's assertion still criticized the weakness of the Hue court and the pacifism of Phan Thanh Gian. Furthermore, the judgment was an admonition for those who were close to France, who favored peace. The judgment implicitly confirmed the Hue court's will to rely on its own means and to expend every effort. Because of this, the spirit of resolution and combativeness among the troops and people were nourished and enhanced.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a></blockquote>

But the author fails to cite any evidence that the "advocates of war" indeed found these proceedings encouraging. In the absence of any such proof, it is more logical to assume that seasoned political observers at court and elsewhere were more impressed by the fact that, as in 1862, Emperor Tu-duc did not authorize military actions to counter the French advances yielded to by Phan Thanh Gian and the other responsible authorities. He refused, until 1874, to sign any <b>(p.56)</b> agreement acknowledging France's <i>de facto</i> control of Vinh-long, An-giang, and Ha-tien.<br><br>

If Tu-duc's machinations at the expense of the Vietnamese negotiators of the 1862 treaty have thus escaped the notice of modern historians, they did not completely elude the criticism of nineteenth-century participants, Phan Thanh Gian's role in the negotiation of the 1862 treaty is discussed in the funeral oration for Phan Thanh Gian written in late 1867 by Phan Phu Thu:<br>
 
<blockquote>The other year, when the peace treaty was settled, you accepted the role of the culprit in order to bring some repose during a difficult period. . . . The surrender of territory must, in the final analysis, be decided by the king. Everyone considers you to have been in error, but how many people know the true situation in our country?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-93">[93]</a></blockquote> 

For obvious reasons, Phan Phu Thu did not give precise details to substantiate his charges. But the text implies that the decision was made by the Tu-duc Emperor himself, presumably in advance, while Phan Thanh Gian "accepted the role of the culprit [<i>ngai da chap nhan vai tro pham-nhan</i>]." In a possible reference to the deceptions arranged by the emperor, Pham Phu Thu rhetorically asked how many people truly understood the reality of the situation, suggesting that those who blamed Phan Thanh Gian for the settlement of 1862 did so in ignorance and error. <br><br>

In view of the above considerations it is not reasonable to suppose that the Vietnamese officials who conceded to France and Spain the religious and territorial stipulations of the 1862 treaty did so without the prior knowledge and approval of the Tu-duc Emperor. Likewise, Phan Thanh Gian's decision not to resist the French in 1867 must have had the emperor's approval. The monarch evidently saw no alternative to the actions taken by his emissaries in yielding these concessions. The Tu-duc Emperor as well as his chu hoa advisors were therefore responsible for agreeing to sign the Treaty of Sai-gon and for allowing France to seize three additional provinces with impunity in 1867. But the monarch evidently wished his loyal ministers to bear as much of the resulting stigma as possible.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-94">[94]</a> <br><br>

After the signing of the 1862 accords, Phan Thanh Gian conducted negotiations with the French aimed at obtaining a reversal of what was for the Vietnamese the most obnoxious of the treaty's articles, the territorial concession. The territorial question was considered paramount because the Gia-dinh area was the most productive agricultural region of the empire, the historical base for the rise of Nguyen power, and the native region of the Tu-duc Emperor's mother.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-95">[95]</a> The possibility of the return of the three provinces in exchange for more extensive financial, economic, and political concessions was the basis of the proposed 1864 agreement, eventually refused by France.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-96">[96]</a> With the collapse of the court's hopes for a rapid revision of the territorial provisions of the 1862 <b>(p.57)</b> accords, Hue's long-term strategy became to obtain the eventual peaceful return of the three provinces through strict compliance with the terms of the treaty. In the words of Phan Thanh Gian, fulfillment of the commercial and religious articles was necessary "to show good will [<i>de to y tot</i>]" in order to keep open the possibility of a territorial retrocession.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-97">[97]</a> As indicated earlier, the proponents of chu hoa believed that France harbored no long-range territorial interests in Vietnam. After the singing of the Treaty of Sai-gon, these officials were encouraged in this interpretation by the example of the English in China, who had returned the administration of Kwangtung province to Chinese hands after an indemnity was met.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-98">[98]</a> When the French returned the province of Vinh-Iong--the French occupation of which had remained unrecognized by treaty--to Vietnamese authority in 1863 after the ratification of the 1862 agreement by the Tu-duc Emperor, the chu hoa group imagined that this proved the efficacy of the peace policy.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-99">[99]</a> This belief became so deeply held that even the renewed French aggressions of 1867 and 1873 were not sufficient to shake their faith in the policy of trading concessions in other domains against the eventuality of territorial retrocession. <br><br>

To summarize, the reasons for France's more aggressive policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> Vietnam from 1858 onward were examined. It was argued that France's opposition to the Vietnamese monarchs' "persecution" of Catholic missionaries was not the basic cause of French intervention. Economic and political factors were fundamental; the protection of Catholicism provided a convenient screen behind which these factors could operate. Turning to the 1858-1862 conflict itself, it was observed that the Vietnamese Catholics indeed brought their aid to the besieged Franco-Spanish forces at Da-nang, and it was described how such Catholic support of the invaders motivated the Tu-duc Emperor to increase the severity of his anti-Catholic edicts. It was further argued that the objective military situation became an increasingly difficult one for the Hue court as the war progressed. Hue's forces, although numerically superior, were far inferior in terms of weaponry and firepower and were hopelessly outmatched at sea. Because of these technological advantages the Franco-Spanish forces were able to destroy the major Vietnamese troop concentrations, fortresses, and strongpoints in the South. Solidly entrenched there, the Europeans blockaded central Vietnam, bringing severe hardships and the threat of famine to the inhabitants. The situation was rendered all the more difficult by the rebellion of the Catholic Le pretender, Pierre Le Duy Phung. To suppress this uprising, the Hue court desperately needed to move northward troops that were occupied fighting the Europeans in the South. These challenges split the official elite: The advocates of war regarded any compromise with the invaders as unwise and immoral; the proponents of peace favored a negotiated settlement because they believed that continued conflict would only bring needless suffering.<br><br>

Finally, the attempt was made to assess the relative responsibility <b>(p.58)</b> of the Tu-duc Emperor and Vietnamese emissary Phan Thanh Gian in the signing of the Treaty of Sai-gon. Vietnamese historians have suggested that Phan Thanh Gian exceeded his authority in granting the Europeans the considerable concessions contained int he 1862 accords, but the evidence examined here indicates that by 182 the Tu-duc Emperor had decided that Vietnam needed peace at any price and probably instructed his emissaries to grant France and Spain the substantial privileges stipulated therein. In so doing the Tu-duc Emperor initiated a historical break with the traditional Nguyen policies for responding to Western intervention. <br><br>

But was this "turning point" genuine or merely apparent? Many French and Vietnamese scholars have argued that Hue's policy in the years after the 1862 treaty did not really change. The purpose of the following chapters is to demonstrate that Hue's policy for responding to French intervention during the 1862-1874 period was fundamentally different than it had been during the period 1802-1862. It will be argued that Hue's policy vis-a-vis France--for Spain had, under French pressure, relinquished all claims to territorial compensation at the expense of Vietnam--was to maintain the peace while pursuing the return of the alienated territories by means of fulfilling the Treaty of Sai-gon's stipulations and by granting additional privileges when necessary to avoid or terminate further armed conflict with France. <br><br>

It was used in juxtaposition to Tonkin to indicate, respectively, the regions known in Vietnamese as the <i>Dang Trong</i> and the <i>Dang Ngoai</i>, that is, the regions formerly under the authority of the Nguyen and Trinh lords. But Cochinchine was also used, as here, to indicate all of Vietnam.<br><br>
