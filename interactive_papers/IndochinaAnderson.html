To avoid possible misunderstanding, it should be said that the December 1978 invasion grew out of armed clashes between partisans of the two revolutionary movements going back possibly as far as 1971.

Unlike earlier scholars who took a negative view of the subject, Anderson saw nationalism as an integrative imaginative process that allows us to feel solidarity for strangers. “In an age when it is so common for progressive, cosmopolitan intellectuals (particularly in Europe?) to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism, its roots in fear and hatred of the Other, and its affinities with racism, it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love, and often profoundly self-sacrificing love,” Anderson wrote in <i>Imagined Communities</i>. “The cultural products of nationalism—poetry, prose fiction, music, plastic arts—show this love very clearly in thousands of different forms and styles.” <br><br>For a scholar of nationalism, it is surprisingly difficult to say what nation Benedict Anderson belonged to. Anderson was a peripatetic child of the British Empire. Born in 1936 in Kunming, China, where his Anglo-Irish father worked for Chinese Maritime Customs, an imperial consortium that collected taxes, the Andersons had to flee to California in 1941 when the Japanese Empire began to expand into the country. The family returned to Ireland in 1945, but occupied an ambiguous position in their ancestral land. One strand of the family had been Irish nationalists of long-standing, but as Anglo-Irish they existed as a privileged minority, enjoying prestige but often excluded from the nation’s core Catholic identity.<br><br>If the Andersons weren’t quite Irish, they weren’t completely English either. The family’s experience in China gave them appreciation for the underside of Empire. As Perry Anderson, Benedict’s younger brother and himself a distinguished historian, once noted, their father’s experience fighting corruption in the colonial management of China left a lasting mark on the children. In 1956, as an undergraduate at Cambridge, Benedict Anderson was radicalized by the protests over the Suez crisis, where he found himself taking sides with anti-imperialist students—many of them born, like him, in the formerly colonized world—against British nationalists who supported the Anglo-French attempt to seize the Suez Canal. Out of his Cambridge experience, Anderson started on the path to becoming a Marxist and an anti-colonialist scholar.<br><br>After Cambridge, Anderson attended Cornell for graduate school and immersed himself in the study of Indonesia. While Anderson spent much of his life in the United States, it wasn’t quite accurate to say that he became an American. In truth, if Anderson had a homeland, it was Indonesia, which he threw his whole heart and mind into not just studying, but also emotionally inhabiting. <br><br>Anderson’s linguistic fluency was almost superhuman. Perry Anderson could read all the major European languages but once ruefully declared his big brother was the true polyglot of the family: Benedict could read Dutch, German, Spanish, Russian, and French and was fully conversant in Indonesian, Javanese, Tagalog, and Thai; he claimed he often thought in Indonesian. (The ability to acquire languages ran in the family—Melanie Anderson, an anthropologist and the younger sister of Perry and Benedict, is fluent in Albanian, Greek, Serbo-Croatian). <br><br>An Indonesian friend of mine once marveled that Benedict Anderson was so at ease in Javanese that he could tell jokes in the language. The friend also favorably compared Anderson with another great expert on Indonesia, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz. “I always profit from reading Geertz but he simply deepens my understanding of Indonesia,” my friend said. “Anderson makes me see things about Indonesia that I never noticed. He knows Indonesia as well as any Indonesian.”  <br><br>Between 1965 and 1966, Indonesia was engulfed in counter-revolutionary violence that led to the American-supported anti-Communist dictator Suharto taking power in 1967. Between 600,000 and one million Indonesians, most of them supporters of the nation’s largest communist party, were killed by the resulting purge. The Central Intelligence Agency, which actively participated in helping the Indonesian military choose targets, called it in a 1968 declassified study “one of the worst mass murders of the twentieth century.”<br><br>The violence of Suharto’s coup was a key turning point in Anderson’s life. It “felt like discovering that a loved one is a murderer,” he wrote. He threw himself into the cause of chronicling the true history of the coup and to countering the propaganda of the Suharto regime. While at Cornell in 1966, Anderson and his colleagues anonymously authored “The Cornell Paper,” a report which became a key document in debunking the official account of the coup, and which was circulated widely in Indonesian dissident circles. Anderson was also one of the only two foreign witnesses at the 1971 show trial of Sudisman, the general secretary of the Indonesian communist party, who was sentenced to death. Anderson would later translate and publish Sudisman’s testimony, another key text in Indonesian history.<br><br>In 1972, Anderson was expelled from Indonesia, becoming an exile from the nation he made his own. He would return to Indonesia only in 1998, after the overthrow of the Suharto regime. After a brief private visit to friends, Anderson had an emotionally charged public event sponsored by the leading Indonesian paper <i>Tempo</i>.<br><br>In a brilliant article in the magazine <i>Lingua Franca</i>, the journalist Scott Sherman described Anderson’s return to Indonesia: <br><br><blockquote>At a luxury hotel in downtown Jakarta, the sixty-two-year-old Anderson, wearing a light shirt and slacks to combat the stifling heat, faced a tense, expectant audience of three hundred generals, senior journalists, elderly professors, former students, and curiosity seekers. In fluent Indonesian, he lashed the political opposition for its timidity and historical amnesia—especially with regard to the massacres of 1965-1966.</blockquote><br><br>During his return to Indonesia, Anderson was reunited with a young Chinese communist who had been on trial with Sudisman. Anderson had thought this young man had been killed with Sudisman. His miraculous survival was one sign that the Suharto regime hadn’t destroyed everything. <br><br>Anderson’s most famous work, <i>Imagined Communities</i>, emerged from the the crucible of Indonesian history. How do diverse nations like Indonesia, made up of many languages and ethnicities, hold together? Why do they sometimes fall apart? What keeps people in large nations from killing each other and why does national cohesion sometime fail? These weren’t abstract questions for Anderson, but were instead born out of lived immersion in Indonesian history.  <br><br>While <i>Imagined Communities</i> is Anderson’s best-known work, everything he wrote is worth reading—there are few more thoughtful studies of transnational terrorism than his <i>Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination</i> (2005). As well-versed in novels and poetry as he was in scholarship, Anderson was an eloquent advocate for global culture, calling attention to the literatures of Indonesia and the Philippines. A world traveler, it is fitting that Benedict Anderson died in Indonesia, a country he could truly call home. <br><br>Jeet Heer is a senior editor at the New Republic.'); break;

Great titles are especially dangerous. <i>Imagined Communities</i> is one of the greatest, and I shall be arguing that the cluster of concepts it sums up deserves still to be central to our thinking about the world. But it is understandable, and touching, that the first footnote to Benedict Anderson’s afterword to his new edition should read, in explanation of the trimming of the title in his text: ‘Aside from the advantages of brevity, IC restfully occludes a pair of words from which the vampires of banality have by now sucked almost all the blood.’<br><br>Night has fallen, and I gather my cloak about me. Part of the force of <i>Imagined Communities</i> as a title – as an idea – comes from the way the two words immediately set the reader wondering whether they are meant as oxymoronic, and if they are, with what degree of irony or regret. The words bring to mind the true strangeness, but also the centrality, of the human will to be connected with others ‘of one’s kind’ whom one will never meet, and never know. Connected with them in the present, by blood or language or difference from a common enemy (or combinations of all three); and connected through time by a shared belonging to something that seems to emerge from a steadier, thicker, more grounded past and be on its way to an indestructible, maybe redeeming future.<br><br>Anderson is the very opposite of an atheist in the face of this religion; or, if he is an unbeliever – and one senses in all of his writings an extraordinary final outsidedness to the worlds he has studied and clearly often loves – it is very much in Santayana’s spirit, with the old philosopher’s ‘There is no God and Mary is His mother.’ For the first move in <i>Imagined Communities</i> is of sympathy, and therefore a full recognition of nationalism’s ability to provide answers to the questions that previous religions had made their own. The nation gives form to a shiftless and arbitrary being on earth, it offers a promise of immortality, it is oriented time and again towards – and beyond – the individual’s death. ‘With the ebbing of religious belief’ – Anderson was writing in 1983 – ‘the suffering which belief in part composed did not disappear. Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity more necessary. What then was required was a secular transformation of fatality into continuity, contingency into meaning.’ For a moment again it is hard to be sure of the tone here. ‘Composed’ is an interesting choice of word. The syntax that follows is lapidary, but brutal. There is a tension in the sentences, which I think is productive in Anderson’s work as a whole; he is sometimes accused of being a Romantic, yet I hear Diderot constantly debating in his pages with Rousseau and Herder; but nonetheless it is sympathy – a determination to pose the question of nation at the level of creaturely pain and vulnerability and fear of the grave – that prevails. ‘The great weakness of all evolutionary/ progressive styles of thought,’ he writes, ‘not excluding Marxism, is that such questions are answered with impatient silence.’<br><br>‘Not excluding Marxism’. The fascination of Anderson’s approach lies in the way the initial leap of understanding in 1983 was made to coexist with a strong (Marxist) commitment to materialist explanation. In many of his books – and again, currently, in <i>Under Three Flags</i> – he becomes, necessarily, a teller of particular national histories and a recorder of all the unlikely things that went to make a ‘Filipino’ or an ‘Indonesian’. But in the beginning, what Anderson wanted to clarify (and keep hold of in subsequent storytelling) were the conditions of production of imagined communities of the new kind. What technologies of representation did they depend on? And who did the representing? From what classes and professions did nationalists come, and how did their particular interests and social styles inflect the great thing represented? How did the invention of the printing press and the imperatives of early European capitalism interact to make nations possible? If there was such a thing as ‘print capitalism’ – such a contingent, but in the end decisive and creative thing – then exactly what were its effects on the vernacular languages, on the segmentation of elites and non-elites, on the look of the map and the sense of belonging to a bounded place? Are not nations always, from the start, one moment in a complex drive to explore and exploit the totality of the globe – to make a new world-system? So that nationalism and internationalism, or <i>Gemeinschaft</i> and globalisation, go together. The pioneers of nationhood were the Creole elites created in the Americas by Spanish and British colonialism. Europe, when its time of nation-forming came, pirated New World models without a second thought. ‘Long-distance nationalism’ is a term Anderson has used lately to characterise the new claims to identity – ethnic, religious, fiercely convinced of the pains of exile – born of the latest waves of migration and diaspora. But all nationalisms are long-distance, as we shall see in <i>Under Three Flags</i>. What differs is their willingness to recognise the fact.<br><br>This is a cruel summary of some tremendous chapters, full of convincing fact. Reading them again in 2006 is an unsettling experience, because it begins to dawn on one that several of Anderson’s key analytic co-ordinates may have altered in form – and altered in relation to one another – even in the brief period since he first laid them out. This would be very remarkable if true, because the structures he pointed to as generative of nations have survived (through various recastings) for five centuries or thereabouts. Take ‘print capitalism’, especially considered in relation to the production of imagined solidarities and kinds of being-through-time. If we were to say that the last 25 years have seen the implanting and diffusion of a ‘screen capitalism’ – one in which print and image and map and diagram are made available to individual users in what seems an equalised and immensely speeded-up field of symbolic production – would that lead us to make connections between the new technics (with its old driving force) and the coming into being of <i>new</i> imagined communities that now put the nation under pressure? ‘We Are All Hizbullah,’ as they say in Jakarta and Grosvenor Square. I chose to write ‘the coming into being of new communities’, but of course it might be – the new communities believe it to be, and work to convince us of their belief – that what we are witnessing is the coming back into being of the <i>old</i>: the very ‘old’ on which Anderson’s original Marxist analysis turned. For it was axiomatic with him that the religious community – he has some unforgettable pages on the subject, working with ideas from Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre – was the model of togetherness that the nation displaced. Or whose historical authority – whose productivity and plausibility – the nation took up into itself.<br><br>I am not a partisan of the idea that the age of the nation-state is at an end. Nor do I think that screen capitalism is on its way to assembling human totalities of an utterly unprecedented kind. So let me put the argument cautiously. It seems to me that a complex rejigging of the balance of forces between nation and ummah, nation and congregation, nation and jihad, nation and chosen people, is underway in many parts of the world – and not only under the banner of Islam. And this has something to do with the new opportunities offered by screen capitalism. Of course, it has just as much to do with the ruin of actual secular national projects in the context of Cold War, resource imperialism, the attentions of the IMF. But actual shipwreck could have elicited no more than despair and anomie. These exist, no doubt, but also elation, inventiveness, ruthlessness, dedication to death. Certain religions believe they are once again a productive, history-making force. They look on the nation as a dead carapace, which one day soon they may make armed and animate again. Or they may discard it, in favour of other unities. The relation of Hizbullah to Lebanon – ‘a non-state within a non-state’, as its supporters are fond of saying – is to be generalised. (Perhaps a better formulation from our point of view would be ‘a non-nation within a nation all too typical of the breed’.)<br><br>We shall see. Even Lebanon may rise from the dead. Those who made it a nation may make it so again. But something fundamental is happening. A shuffling and grating of imagined communities is taking place. And this is connected, as I say, with the arrival of a new technics of representation. <i>Imagined Communities</i> gives us the beginning of a way to think about just such matters, in its treatment of the effect of print capitalism on the day-to-day imagining of those things called ‘languages’, and its reflections on the role of the newspaper and the novel. ‘In a rather special sense, the book was the first modern-style mass-produced industrial commodity.’ ‘The newspaper is merely an extreme form of the book, a book sold on a colossal scale, but of ephemeral popularity. Might we say: one-day bestsellers?’ After reading Anderson, one never opens the paper over breakfast without somehow remembering:<br><br><blockquote>The significance of this mass ceremony – Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers – is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others of whose existence he is confident, yet of whose identity he has not the slightest notion. Furthermore, this ceremony is incessantly repeated at daily or half-daily intervals throughout the calendar. What more vivid figure for the secular, historically clocked, imagined community can be envisioned?</blockquote><br><br>You will notice that the crucial form of words here is ‘vivid figure for’ rather than ‘effective cause of’. But not only literary critics and media buffs have leapt to the conclusion that Anderson’s argument in the end exceeds his careful (Marxist) framing. Well yes, print capitalism is a function of capitalism, and newspapers and novels issue from – and are informed and altered by – an evolving bourgeois culture in which the styles of individuality and citizenship are very far from being created out of words on a page alone. No newspapers without clubs and coffee houses, no novels (or not the novels we have) without the great vagaries of class. Nonetheless, the question of technical, representational efficacity – the bias of certain means and relations of symbolic production towards some forms of imagined identity in preference to others – will not go away. Do we think that the novel and the newspaper were more effective, for instance, at generating nationhood than class consciousness? (A hard question, I know, since bourgeoisie and nationality are so much transforms of one another.) If so, why? For reasons wholly, or even largely, independent of the nature of the apparatus in each case?<br><br>I do not think so. Hegel’s world-historical sarcasm rings in my ears; and it too, in 2006, threatens to turn back on those (like me) who wish it were still true. For newspapers are less and less a substitute for anything, and in much of the world morning prayers are no longer to be substituted for by any such private (public) form of representation. Screen capitalism is dissolving the very structure of private (public) being-together. It is wrecking the quiet simultaneity of clock-time. Atrocity happens NOW. The ‘now’ that language inevitably conjures away into repeatability and abstraction, the image preserves for ever in what seems to be its mere being. The event on the screen is unique and eternal. It belongs again to God or Satan. The website and the cellphone video are paths to the sacred. Morning prayer is everywhere.<br><br>Of course this imagined community is counterfactual, and interfered with at every point by the realities of the secular world. But insofar as those realities turn on death and humiliation, they feed the imaginary as opposed to undermining it. Especially when ‘nation’ presents itself, by contrast, as humiliation personified. When nation can no longer lay claim to death – when it cedes death to its new-old opponent – a form of life has grown old.<br><br><i>Under Three Flags</i> is a study of the forces that went to make the imagined community of the Philippines. This means it is fiercely, movingly local, concentrated on a handful of remarkable men and fateful years, but also expansively – at times bewilderingly – global. Things begin in 1887, in Berlin and Manila, with two brilliant young ‘Filipinos’ bringing out books on opposite sides of the world: an astonishing first novel of colonial life, and a massive study of island customs and forms of words. The former was <i>Noli me tangere</i>, the latter <i>El folk-lore filipino</i>. The author of the novel (shivering in Bismarck’s capital) was José Rizal, aged 25; that of the folklore compendium Isabelo de los Reyes, two years Rizal’s junior. Rizal had nine years to live. He was executed in the public square in Manila in 1896, at the hands of Spaniards by then fighting off a national uprising. Isabelo was jailed the same year, and subsequently shipped off to Spain. He spent a year in the torture chambers of Montjuich, and had to wait out the bloodbath of US ‘liberation’, returning in 1901 to found the Unión Obrera Democrática – putting into practice ideas of anarchist and syndicalist organisation learned in Barcelona. In 1887 he had prided himself on being a scientist, with parts of his book already published in German in Globus and Ausland. When he went back to Manila in 1901 his small travelling library centred on Aquinas and Voltaire, Proudhon and the Bible, Darwin and Marx, Kropotkin and Malatesta.<br><br>Like all Anderson’s books since 1983, this one aims to put the aphoristic clarities of <i>Imagined Communities</i> under pressure. ‘Nation’ is a comparative concept by its very nature, and studying any one nation involves putting it into a firmament of similar-but-different. The earlier book was marvellous at this. Its great map of types and apparatuses and models and kinds of copying made many things clear. But it was a map, and for the Anderson of recent years its object of study looks, in retrospect, too much like a firmament, not an archipelago. The stars in the 1983 sky were apparently stationary, and therefore too beautiful. ‘Such is the Chaldean elegance of the comparative method, which … allowed me once to juxtapose “Japanese” nationalism with “Hungarian”, “Venezuelan” with “American”, and “Indonesian” with “Swiss”. Each shining with its own separate, steady, unitary light.’ Is it possible to write a history of nations, then, that stays true to the original astronomical impulse – Anderson is more and more convinced that no one nation’s history makes sense except in the broadest, most world-encompassing optic – but has its particular nationalisms be hybrid through and through, and always on the move? This is the new book’s question.<br><br>The Philippines in the 1890s ought to provide a good testing ground for non-Chaldean astronomy because in them the unique and the world-historical are so vividly face to face. Rizal looms over the tragic scene: he is its voice, its victim, its epitome of death and resurrection. The paradox of national language is writ large: Rizal’s great verses of farewell to his homeland in 1896 are written, like his novels, in exquisite Spanish, though they were very quickly rendered into Tagalog. (The translator was Andrés Bonifacio, leader of the Most Illustrious, Most Respectable League of the Sons-and-Daughters of the People. When he had heard, months earlier, of Rizal’s decision not to join what he saw as a premature revolution, he had exploded in anger at the novelist’s cowardice. Bonifacio in turn survived until May 1897. He was executed for treason to the revolution by a rival nationalist leader.) Over the next century the poem was translated into 49 Philippine languages.<br><br>This book is one of several in which Anderson has taken the measure of Rizal as Father of the Nation, and of his literary achievement. <i>Noli me tangere</i> is in many ways the very model of anti-colonial realism, conjuring the space and time of Spanish-ruled Manila with easy, sardonic confidence. It is anti-clerical, satiric, erotic, melodramatic – and it establishes its ‘reader’ (its Illustrious Son-or-Daughter of the People) with all the certainty of Fielding or Stendhal. Already in <i>Imagined Communities</i>, Rizal’s first book is Anderson’s preferred example of all that a novel’s way of world-making can do, and what the mass ceremony of its reading (through the years) made thinkable. But Rizal presents a problem, which a large part of <i>Under Three Flags</i> is intended to solve. Four years after <i>Noli me tangere</i>, a second and final novel by Rizal appeared, with the untranslatable title El filibusterismo, published in the grimness of Ghent. (‘Revolutionary buccaneering’ is about as close as English can get, and nothing will quite dispel the image of bores in the Senate.) The book is a sequel to the earlier story, but a bizarre and catastrophic one. The dead hero of <i>Noli me tangere</i> reappears, resurrected, hiding behind a pair of dark blue spectacles, and sets off this time to drag the whole of Philippine elite society into the abyss. They are to be blown to pieces finally, at a lavish wedding feast in Manila, by a bomb concealed in a pomegranate chandelier. The police get the whiff of nitroglycerine just in time. The hero is mortally wounded, and dies, talking to the end, on a lonely beach.<br><br>I have to take on faith from Anderson that <i>El filibusterismo</i>, like many another late 19th-century novel, has immensely more aesthetic energy than its silly story would suggest. And <i>Under Three Flags</i> certainly succeeds in placing the novel and its author in a world of late 1880s literature and politics. By 1891, Rizal read German and French as well as a smattering of English. He had lived in Paris, Berlin and London. Madrid he looked down on as backward and parochial. <i>El filibusterismo</i> has a French vaudeville outfit turning up in Manila, a local Chinese planning to set up a consulate, and a Yankee called Mr Leeds. ‘The book is littered with casual references to Egypt, Poland, Peru, Germany, Russia, Cuba, Persia, the Carolines, Ceylon, the Moluccas, Libya, France, China and Japan.’<br><br>This casually (but chaotically) international frame of reference is important, because it dovetails with Anderson’s whole sense of the last years of the century as witnessing ‘the onset of what one could call early globalisation’.<br><br><blockquote>The near-simultaneity of the last nationalist insurrection in the New World (Cuba, 1895) and the first in Asia (the Philippines, 1896) was no serendipity. Natives of the last important remnants of the Spanish empire, Cubans … and Filipinos did not merely read about each other, but had crucial personal connections and, up to a point, co-ordinated their actions – the first time in world history that such transglobal co-ordination became possible.</blockquote><br><br>And – final sign of the new age – both revolutions were eventually beaten senseless by Theodore Roosevelt’s big stick.<br><br>Over the new interconnectedness of the world-system (this is Anderson’s final and pervasive point) loomed an image of a different kind of internationalism, suitably mobile, intent on taking advantage of the new technologies of round-the-globe communication, and ready to make revolution under any and every banner. To wit, anarchism – and pre-eminently, for a while, the anarchism of ‘propaganda by the deed’. Table 1 of <i>Under Three Flags</i> (Anderson is ever the political scientist) is a year-by-year chart of assassinations from 1894 to 1914, with victim, place and method, assassin’s identity, nationality and political orientation. ‘The assassins, some of whom could well be described as early suicide bombers, understood themselves as acting for a world audience of news agencies, newspapers, religious progressives, working-class and peasant organisations.’ You will notice that <i>El filibusterismo</i> appeared three years before the chart gets going. It is ‘proleptic’, says Anderson. A little uneasy, this. But he has no trouble showing that Rizal would have read much, and met many with dynamite already on their minds.<br><br>Anderson is clearly sympathetic to anarchist internationalism, and he makes the case for propaganda by the deed’s emergence from a texture of desperate struggles, in which the balance of brutality always lay, overwhelmingly, with the forces of civilisation. The list of victims in his table elicits few tears. But I have to say – again, the fact of my reading this book in the summer of 2006 may have much to do with this – that the table as a whole seems a chronicle of futility, from which anarchism never completely recovered. (It had made a spectacle of itself, one might say; and unmaking spectacle is a long process.) Anderson admires the Cuban creole Fernando Tárrida, whom Rizal just missed meeting in Barcelona, and has a special liking for Tárrida’s ‘Anarchism without Adjectives’. I see his point. Hyphens in politics are often the mark of watering down. But anarcho-syndicalism, when it came, was certainly better than anarcho-symbolism, or anarcho-decadence or anarcho-martyrology. It was a necessary antidote to the previous Isadora-Duncan-with-blood. Isabelo’s Unión Obrera Democrática sounds to have been anarcho-syndicalist to the letter.<br><br>This disagreement is shadowed, as I say, by the futilities of the present. Some of the points Anderson makes about the animating force of anarchism within nationalism, and about the strange networks by which both spread in the 1890s, are persuasive, and some less so. He has a hard time getting anarchism within a thousand miles of José Martí. I agree finally, but with a shudder, that this fin de siècle reminds us that nationalism regularly thrives on doom. Apocalypse is one of its modes. No better time for the making of nations than a time when nations are broken. Out of the shards will be made the genuine article, and the maker – the breaker – will be the Nation in its true, transfigured guise.<br><br>    <blockquote>Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;<br><br>    And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;<br><br>    With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;<br><br>    I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.</blockquote><br><br>The last ‘also’ is hard to bear: it reminds me of a Stalinist bureaucrat making sure he has ticked off all the class enemies. The Authorised Version’s English seems to have no trouble with the sixth-century BC sentiments. Don’t <i>chosenness</i> and nationhood go together through the ages? And aren’t nations regularly assembled from the materials Jeremiah reviews? (I got to the Old Testament via Thomas Hardy’s great poem written in 1915.) Not nations alone, of course. I am not meaning to make nationalism, in the finish, the sole demon of history. But I see writers with whom I enormously sympathise turning to ‘nation’ lately as a last refuge, it seems, from the storm. I study my Bible and <i>El filibusterismo</i>, and still wonder where the storm comes from.'); break;

<b>First Paragraph of Introduction:</b> <br><br>
Perhaps without being much noticed yet, a fundamental transformation in the history of Marxism and Marxist movements is upon us. Its most visible signs are the recent wars between Vietnam, Cambodia and China. These wars are of world-historical importance because they are the first to occur between regimes whose independence and revolutionary credentials are undeniable, and because none of the belligerents has made more than the most perfunctory attempts to justify the bloodshed in terms of a recognizable Marxist theoretical perspective. While it was still just possible to interpret the Sino-Soviet border clashes of 1969, and the Soviet military interventions in Germany (1953), Hungary (1956), Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1980) in terms of — according to taste —‘social imperialism,’ ‘defending socialism,’ etc., no one, I imagine, seriously believes that such vocabularies have much bearing on what has occurred in Indochina.

for one generation of relatively well educated adolescents, the curious hybrid ‘Indochine’ had a real, experienced, imagined meaning.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> This entity, it will be recalled, was not legally proclaimed until 1887, and did not acquire its fullest territorial form until 1907, though active French meddling in the general area went back a century earlier.

<b>Last Paragraph of Indochinese Section from The Last Wave:</b>
<br><br>
Out of these contradictions emerged those Khmer-speaking students who subsequently came to be remembered as the first Cambodian nationalists. The man who can reasonably be regarded as the ‘father’ of Khmer nationalism, Son Ngoc Thanh, was, as his Vietnamized name suggests, a Khmer Krom who was educated in Saigon and for a while held a minor judicial post in that city. But in the mid-1930s he abandoned the Paris of the Mekong Delta to seek a more promising future in its Blois. Prince Sisowath Youtevong attended secondary school in Saigon before leaving for France for further study. When he returned to Phnom Penh fifteen years later, after World War II, he helped to found the {Khmer) Democratic Party and served as Prime Minister in 1946-1947. His Defence Minister, Sonn Voeunnsai, undertook virtually the same journeys. Huy Kanthoul, Democratic Prime Minister in 1951-1952, had graduated from an <i>école normale</i> in Hanoi in 1931, and was then returned to Phnom Penh, where he eventually joined the Lycée Sisowath’s teaching staff.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> Perhaps most exemplary of all is the <b>(p.131)</b> figure of leu Koeus, first of a melancholy line of assassinated Khmer political leaders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> Born in the province of Battambangin 1905-when it was still ruled from Bangkok- he attended a local ‘reformed pagoda school’ before entering an ‘Indochinese’ elementary school in Battambang town. In 1921, he proceeded to the Collège Sisowath in the Protectorate’s capital, and then to a <i>collège de commerce</i> in Hanoi, from which he graduated in 1927 at the top of his French-reading class. Hoping to study chemistry in Bordeaux, he took and passed the scholarship examination. But the colonial state blocked his way abroad. He returned to his native Battambang, where he ran a pharmacy, continuing to do so even after Bangkok regained the province in 1941. After the Japanese collapse in August 1945, he reappeared in ‘Cambodge’ as a Democratic parliamentarian. It is notable that he was in his way a lineal descendent of the illustrious philologists of an earlier Europe, insofar as he designed a typewriter keyboard for the Khmer script and published a weighty two-volume Phefsa Khmer [The Khmer Language], or as the misleading tide-page of the 1967 edition has it, <i>La Langue Cambodgienne (Un Essai d’étude raisonné)</i>.[34] But this text made its first appearance - volume 1 only - in 1947, when its author was Chairman of the Constituent Assembly in Phnom Penh, not in 1937, when he was vegetating in Battambang, when as yet no Khmer-speaking <i>lycéens</i> had been produced by the Lycée Sisowath, and when Indochina still had an ephemeral reality. By 1947, Khmer-speakers - at least those from ‘Cambodge’ - were no longer attending classes in Saigon or Hanoi. A new generation was coming on the scene for whom ‘Indochine’ was history and ‘Vietnam’ now a real and foreign country.

<b>Topic Sentences</b><br><br>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br><br>
(1) Perhaps without being much noticed yet, a fundamental transformation in the history of Marxism and Marxist movements is upon us.
<br><br>
(2) If the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia in December 1978 and January 1979 represented the first <i>large-scale conventional war</i> waged by one revolutionary Marxist regime against another, China’s assault on Vietnam in February rapidly confirmed the precedent. 
<br><br>
(3) Such considerations serve to underline the fact that since World War II every successful revolution has defined itself in <i>national</i> terms — the People’s Republic of China, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and so forth —and, in so doing, has grounded itself firmly in a territorial and social space inherited from the prerevolutionary past.
<br><br>
(4) Eric Hobsbawm is perfectly correct in stating that ‘Marxist movements and states have tended to become national not only in form but in substance, i.e., nationalist. 
<br><br>
(5) But if the facts are clear, their explanation remains a matter of long-standing dispute.
<br><br>
(6) The aim of this book is to offer some tentative suggestions for a more satisfactory interpretation of the ‘anomaly’ of nationalism.
<br><br>
<b>CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS</b>
<br><br>
(7) Before addressing the questions raised above, it seems advisable to consider briefly the concept of ‘nation’ and offer a workable definition.
<br><br>
(8) Part of the difficulty is that one tends unconsciously to hypostasize the existence of Nationalism-with-a-big-N (rather as one might Age-with-a-capital-A) and then to classify ‘it’ as <i>an</i> ideology.
<br><br>
(9) In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community- and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.
<br><br>
(10) It is <i>imagined</i> because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.
<br><br>
(11) The nation is imagined as <i>limited</i> because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite: if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations.
<br><br>
(12) It is imagined as <i>sovereign</i> because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchicai dynastic realm.
<br><br>
(13) Finally, it is imagined as a <i>community</i>, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship.
<br><br>
(14) These deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism: what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history (scarcely more than two centuries) generate such colossal sacrifices? I believe that the beginnings of an answer lie in the cultural roots of nationalism
<br><br>
<b>The Last Wave</b>
<br><br>
(1) for one generation of relatively well educated adolescents, the curious hybrid ‘Indochine’ had a real, experienced, imagined meaning.
<br><br>
(2) Broadly speaking, the educational policy pursued by the colonial rulers of ‘Indochine’ had two fundamental purposes- both of which, as it turned out, contributed to the growth of an ‘Indochinese’ consciousness.
<br><br>
(3) In eastern Indochina (my shorthand for ‘Tonkin,’ ‘Annam ‘and ‘Cochin China’), the target was China and Chinese civilization.
<br><br>
(4) Accordingly, Confucian examinations were successively abolished in ‘Tonkin’ in 1915 and in ‘Annam’ in 1918. One aim was to break existing politico-cultural ties between the colonized peoples and the immediate extra-Indochinese world.”
<br><br>
(5) The second aim of educational policy was to produce a carefully-calibrated quantum of French-speaking and French-writing Indochinese to serve as a politically reliable, grateful, and acculturated indigenous elite, filling the subordinate echelons of the colony’s bureaucracy and larger commercial enterprises.
<br><br>
(6) The intricacies of the colonial educational system need not detain us here. . . . This Indochinese-ness, although it was quite real, was nonetheless imagined by a tiny group, and not for very long. Why did it turn out to be so evanescent, while Indonesian-ness survived and deepened?
<br><br>
(7) First there was a marked change of course in colonial education, above all as applied in eastern Indochina, from about 1917 on. 
<br><br>
(8) Second, in 1935 the Collège Sisowath in Phnom Penh was upgraded into a full-fledged state <i>lycée</i>, with a status equal to, <i>and a curriculum identical with</i>, those of the existing state <i>lycées</i> in Saigon and Hanoi.
<br><br>
(9) Third was the fact that there was no real isomorphism between the , educational and administrative pilgrimages in Indochina.
<br><br>
(10) Such imagining was much less easy for Lao and Khmer functionaries, although there was no formal or legal prohibition on fully-Indochinese careers for them.
<br>
(11) Out of these contradictions emerged those Khmer-speaking students who subsequently came to be remembered as the first Cambodian nationalists. . . . By 1947, Khmer-speakers - at least those from ‘Cambodge’ - were no longer attending classes in Saigon or Hanoi. A new generation was coming on the scene for whom ‘Indochine’ was history and ‘Vietnam’ now a real and foreign country.

<b>Introduction</b>
<br><br>
Perhaps without being much noticed yet, a fundamental transformation in the history of Marxism and Marxist movements is upon us. Its most visible signs are the recent wars between Vietnam, Cambodia and China. These wars are of world-historical importance because they are the first to occur between regimes whose independence and revolutionary credentials are undeniable, and because none of the belligerents has made more than the most perfunctory attempts to justify the bloodshed in terms of a recognizable Marxist theoretical perspective. While it was still just possible to interpret the Sino-Soviet border clashes of 1969, and the Soviet military interventions in Germany (1953), Hungary (1956), Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1980) in terms of — according to taste —‘social imperialism,’ ‘defending socialism,’ etc., no one, I imagine, seriously believes that such vocabularies have much bearing on what has occurred in Indochina.
<br><br>
If the Viemamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia in December 1978 and January 1979 represented the first <i>large-scale conventional war</i> waged by one revolutionary Marxist regime against another,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> China’s assault on Vietnam in February rapidly confirmed <b>(p.2)</b> the precedent. Only the most trusting would dare wager that in the declining years of this century any significant outbreak of inter-state hostilities will necessarily find the USSR and the PR — let alone the smaller socialist states — supporting, or fighting on, the same side. Who can be confident that Yugoslavia and Albania will not one day come to blows? Those variegated groups who seek a withdrawal of the Red Army from its encampments in Eastern Europe should remind themselves of the degree to which its overwhelming presence has, since 1945, ruled out armed conflict between the region’s Marxist regimes.
<br><br>
Such considerations serve to underline the fact that since World War II every successful revolution has defined itself in <i>national</i> terms — the People’s Republic of China, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and so forth —and, in so doing, has grounded itself firmly in a territorial and social space inherited from the prerevolutionary past. Conversely, the fact that the Soviet Union shares with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the rare distinction of refusing nationality in its naming suggests that it is as much the legatee of the prenational dynastic states of the nineteenth century as the precursor of a twenty-first century internationalist order.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a>

Eric Hobsbawm is perfectly correct in stating that ‘Marxist movements and states have tended to become national not only in form but in substance, i.e., nationalist. There is nothing to suggest <b>(p. 3)</b> that this trend will not continue.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> Nor is the tendency confined to the socialist world. Almost every year the United Nations admits new members. And many ‘old nations,’ once thought fully consolidated, find themselves challenged by ‘sub’-nationalisms within their borders — nationalisms which, naturally, dream of shedding this subness one happy day. The reality is quite plain: the ‘end of the era of nationalism,’ so long prophesied, is not remotely in sight. Indeed, nation-ness is the most universally legitimate value in the political life of our time. ‘’
<br><br>
But if the facts are clear, their explanation remains a matter of long-standing dispute. Nation, nationality, nationalism — all have proved notoriously difficult to define, let alone to analyse. In contrast to the immense influence that nationalism has exerted on the modern world, plausible theory about it is conspicuously meagre. Hugh Seton-Watson, author of far the best and most comprehensive English-language text on nationalism, and heir to a vast tradition of liberal historiography and social science, sadly observes: ‘Thus I am driven to the conclusion that no “scientific definition” of the nation can be devised; yet the phenomenon has existed and exists.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> Tom Nairn, author of the path-breaking <i>The Break-up of Britain</i>, and heir to the scarcely less vast tradition of Marxist historiography and social science, candidly remarks: ‘The theory of nationalism represents Marxism’s great historical failure.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> But even this confession is somewhat misleading, insofar as it can be taken to imply the regrettable outcome of a long, self-conscious search for theoretical clarity. It would be more exact to say that nationalism has proved an uncomfortable <i>anomaly</i> for Marxist theory and, precisely for that reason, has been largely elided, rather than confronted. How else to explain Marx’s failure to explicate the crucial adjective in his memorable formulation of 1848: ‘The proletariat of each country <b>(p. 4)</b> must, of course, first of all settle matters with <i>its own bourgeoisie</i>’?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> How else to account for the use, for over a century, of the concept ‘national bourgeoisie’ without any serious attempt to justify theoretically the relevance of the adjective? Why is <i>this </i>segmentation of the bourgeoisie -a world-class insofar as it is defined in terms of the relations of production- theoretically significant?
<br><br>
The aim of this book is to offer some tentative suggestions for a more satisfactory interpretation of the ‘anomaly’ of nationalism. My sense is that on this topic both Marxist and liberal theory have become etiolated in a late Ptolemaic effort to ‘save the phenomena’; and that a reorientation of perspective in, as it were, a Copernican spirit is urgently required. My point of departure is that nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word’s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular kind. To understand them properly we need to consider carefully how they have come into historical being, in what ways their meanings have changed over time, and why, today, they command such profound emotional legitimacy. I will be trying to argue that the creation of these artefacts towards the end of the eighteenth century<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> was the spontaneous distillation of a complex ‘crossing’ of discrete historical forces; but that, once created, they became ‘modular,’ capable of being transplanted, with varying degrees of self-consciousness, to a great variety of social terrains, to merge and be merged with a correspondingly wide variety of political and ideological constellations. I will also attempt to show why these particular cultural artefacts have aroused such deep attachments.
<br><br>
<b>(p.5)</b> <b>CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS</b>
<br><br>
Before addressing the questions raised above, it seems advisable to consider briefly the concept of ‘nation’ and offer a workable definition. Theorists of nationalism have often been perplexed, not to say irritated, by these three paradoxes: (1) The objective modernity of nations to the historian’s eye vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists. (2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept- in the modern world everyone can, should, will ‘have’ a nationality, as he or she ‘has’ a gender-vs. the irremediable particularity of its concrete manifestations, such that, by definition, ‘Greek’ nationality is sui generis. (3) The ‘political’ power of nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence. In other words, unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own grand thinkers: no Hoobeses, Tocquevilles, Marxes, or Webers. This ‘emptiness’ easily gives rise, among cosmopolitan and polylingual intellectuals, to a certain condescension. Like Gertrude Stein in the face of Oakland, one can rather quickly conclude that there is ‘no there there’. It is characteristic that even so sympathetic a student of nationalism as Tom Nairn can nonetheless write that: ‘“Nationalism” is the pathology of modern developmental history, as inescapable as “neurosis” in the individual, with much the same essential ambiguity attaching to it, a similar built-in capacity for descent into dementia, rooted in the dilemmas of helplessness thrust upon most of the world (the equivalent of infantilism for societies) and largely incurable.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a>
<br><br>
Part of the difficulty is that one tends unconsciously to hypostasize the existence of Nationalism-with-a-big-N (rather as one might Age-with-a-capital-A) and then to classify ‘it’ as <i>an</i> ideology. (Note that if everyone has an age, Age is merely an analytical expression.) It would, I think, make things easier if one treated it as if it belonged with ‘kinship’ and ‘religion’, rather than with ‘liberalism’ or ‘fascism’.
<br><br>
In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition <b>(p.6)</b> of the nation: it is an imagined political community- and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.
<br><br>
It is <i>imagined</i> because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> Renan referred to this imagining in his suavely back-handed way when he wrote that ‘Or l’essence d’une nation est que tous les individus aient beaucoup de choses en commun, et aussi que tous aient oublié bien des choses.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> With a certain ferocity Gellner makes a comparable point when he rules that ‘Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it <i>invents</i> nations where they do not exist.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> The drawback to this formulation, however, is that Gellner is so anxious to show that nationalism masquerades under false pretences that he assimilates ‘invention’ to ‘fabrication’ and ‘falsity’, rather than to ‘imagining’ and ‘creation’. In this way he implies that ‘true’ communities exist which can be advantageously juxtaposed to nations. In fact, all communities larger than primordial villages of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined. Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined. Javanese villagers have always known that they are connected to people they have never seen, but these ties were once imagined particularistically- as indefinitely stretchable nets of kinship and clientship. Until quite recently, the Javanese language had no word meaning the abstraction ‘society.’ We may today think of the French aristocracy of the <i>ancien régime</i> as a class; but surely it was imagined <b>(p.7)</b> this way only very late.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> To the question ‘Who is the Comte de X?’ the normal answer would have been, not ‘a member of the aristocracy,’ but ‘the lord of X,’ ‘the uncle of the Baronne de Y,’ or ‘a client of the Duc de Z.’
<br><br>
The nation is imagined as <i>limited</i> because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite: if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind: The most messianic nationalists do not dream of a day when all the members of the human race will join their nation in the way that it was possible: in certain epochs, for, say, Christians to dream of a wholly Christian planet.
<br><br>
It is imagined as <i>sovereign</i> because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchicai dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism between each faith’s ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gage and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state.
<br><br>
Finally, it is imagined as a <i>community</i>, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.
<br><br>
These deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism: what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history (scarcely more than two centuries) generate such colossal sacrifices? I believe that the beginnings of an answer lie in the cultural roots of nationalism.
<br><br>
<b>(p.124)</b> <b>The Last Wave</b>
<br><br>
for one generation of relatively well educated adolescents, the curious hybrid ‘Indochine’ had a real, experienced, imagined meaning.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> This entity, it will be recalled, was not legally proclaimed until 1887, and did not acquire its fullest territorial form until 1907, though active French meddling in the general area went back a century earlier.
<br><br>
Broadly speaking, the educational policy pursued by the colonial rulers of ‘Indochine’ had two fundamental purposes<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> - both of which, as it turned out, contributed to the growth of an ‘Indochinese’ consciousness. One aim was to break existing politico-cultural ties between the colonized peoples and the immediate extra-Indochinese
<b>(p.125)</b> world.” As far as ‘Cambodge’ and ‘Laos’ were concerned,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> the target was Siam, which had previously exercised a variable suzerainty over them and shared with both the rituals, institutions, and sacred language of Hinayana Buddhism. (In addition, the language and script of the lowland Lao were, and are, closely related to those of the Thai). It was precisely out of this concern that the French experimented first in those zones <i>last</i> seized from Siam with the so-called ‘renovated pagoda schools,’ which were designed to move Khmer monks and their pupils out of the Thai orbit into that of Indochina.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a>
<br><br>
In eastern Indochina (my shorthand for ‘Tonkin,’ ‘Annam ‘and ‘Cochin China’), the target was China and Chinese civilization. Although the dynasties ruling in Hanoi and Hue had for centuries defended their independence from Peking, they came to rule through a mandarinate consciously modelled on that of the Chinese. Recruitment into the state machinery was geared to written examinations in the Confucian classics; dynastic documents were written in Chinese characters; and the ruling class was heavily Sinicized in culture. These long-standing ties assumed an additionally unwelcome character after about 1895, when the writings of such Chinese reformers as K’ang Yu-wei and Liang Ch’i-ch’ao, and nationalists like Sun Yat-sen, began seeping across the northern frontier of the colony.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a>
<br><br>
<b>(p.126)</b> Accordingly, Confucian examinations were successively abolished in ‘Tonkin’ in 1915 and in ‘Annam’ in 1918. Henceforth, recruitment into the civil services of Indochina was to take place exclusively through a developing French colonial education system. Furthermore, <i>quoc ngu</i>, a romanized phonetic script originally devised by Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> and adopted by the authorities for use in ‘Cochin China’ as early as the 1860s, was consciously promoted to break the links with China -- and perhaps also with the indigenous past -- by making dynastic records and ancient literatures inaccessible to a new generation of colonized Vietnamese.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a>
<br><br>
The second aim of educational policy was to produce a carefully-calibrated quantum of French-speaking and French-writing Indochinese to serve as a politically reliable, grateful, and acculturated indigenous elite, filling the subordinate echelons of the colony’s bureaucracy and larger commercial enterprises.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a>
<br><br>
The intricacies of the colonial educational system need not detain us here. For our present purposes, the key characteristic of the system was that it formed a single, if ramshackle, pyramid, of which, until the mid-1930s, the upper terraces all lay in the east. Up until then, for <b>(p.127)</b> 
example, the only state-sponsored <i>lycées</i> were located in Hanoi and Saigon; and throughout the prewar colonial period, the sole university in Indochina was located in Hanoi, so to speak ‘just down the street’ from the palace of the Governor-General.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> The climbers of these terraces included all the major vernacular-speakers of the French domain: Vietnamese, Chinese, Khmer, and Lao (and not a few young French colonials). For the climbers, coming from, shall we say, My Tho, Battambang, Vientiane, and Vinh, the meaning of their convergence had to be ‘Indochinese,’ in the same way that the polyglot and polyethnic student body of Batavia and Bandung had to read theirs as ‘Indonesian.’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> This Indochinese-ness, although it was quite real, was nonetheless imagined by a tiny group, and not for very long. Why did it turn out to be so evanescent, while Indonesian-ness survived and deepened?
<br><br>
First there was a marked change of course in colonial education, above all as applied in eastern Indochina, from about 1917 on. The actual, or immediately impending, liquidation of the traditional Confucian examination system persuaded more and more members of the Vietnamese elite to try to place their children in the best French schools available, so as to ensure their bureaucratic futures. The resulting competition for places in the few good schools <b>(p.128)</b> available 
aroused a particularly strong reaction from the <i>colons</i>, who regarded these schools as by right a largely French preserve. The colonial regime’s solution to the problem was to create a separate and subordinate ‘Franco-Vietnamese’ educational structure which placed special emphasis, in its lower grades, on Vietnamese-language instruction in <i>quoc ngu</i> (with French taught as a second language via ·the medium of <i>quoc ngu</i>).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> This policy shift had two complementary results. On the one hand, government publication of hundreds of thousands of <i>quoc ngu</i> primers significantly accelerated the spread of this European-invented script, unintentionally helping to turn it, between 1920 and 1945, into <i>the</i> popular medium for the expression of Vietnamese cultural (and national) solidarity.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> For even if only 10 per cent of the Vietnamese-speaking population was literate by the late 1930s, this was a proportion unprecedented in the history of this people. Moreover, these literates were, unlike the Confucian literati, deeply committed to a rapid increase in their own numbers. (Similarly, in ‘Cambodge’ and ‘Laos’, if on a more limited scale, the authorities promoted the <i>printing</i> of elementary school-texts in the vernaculars, initially and mainly in the traditional orthographies, later and more feebly in romanized scripts).<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> On the other hand, the policy worked to exclude non-native-Vietnamese-speakers residing in eastern Indochina. In the case of the Khmer Krom of ‘Cochin <b>(p.129)</b> China,’ it worked, in combination with the colonial regime’s willingness to permit them to have ‘Franco-Khmer’ elementary schools like those being encouraged in the Protectorate to re-orient ambitions <i>back</i> up the Mekong. Thus those Khmer Krom adolescents who aspired to higher education in the administrative capital of Indochina (and, for a select few, even in metropolitan France) increasingly took the detour via Phnom Penh rather than the highway through Saigon.
<br><br>
Second, in 1935 the Collège Sisowath in Phnom Penh was upgraded into a full-fledged state <i>lycée</i>, with a status equal to, <i>and a curriculum identical with</i>, those of the existing state <i>lycées</i> in Saigon and Hanoi. Although its students were at first drawn heavily (in the tradition of the Collège) from local Sino-Khmer merchant families and those of resident Vietnamese functionaries, the proportion of native Khmers steadily increased.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> It is probably fair to say that, after 1940, the great bulk of Khmer-speaking adolescents who achieved a solid French high-school education did so in the neat colonial capital the colonialists had built for the Norodoms.
<br><br>
Third was the fact that there was no real isomorphism between the , educational and administrative pilgrimages in Indochina. The French made no bones about expressing the view that if the Vietnamese were untrustworthy and grasping, they were nonetheless decisively more energetic and intelligent than the ‘child-like’ Khmer and Lao. Accordingly, they made extensive use of Vietnamese functionaries in western Indochina. <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> The 176,000 Vietnamese residing in ‘Cambodge’ in 1937- representing less than one per cent of the 19 million Vietnamese-speakers of the colony, but about 6 per cent of the Protectorate’s population-formed a relatively successful group, for whom therefore Indochina had a rather solid meaning, as it did for <b>(p.130)</b> the 50,000 sent into ‘Laos’ prior to 1945. Particularly the functionaries among them, who might be posted from place to place in all five subsections of the colony, could well imagine Indochina as the wide stage on which they would continue to perform.
<br><br>
Such imagining was much less easy for Lao and Khmer functionaries, although there was no formal or legal prohibition on fully-Indochinese careers for them. Even the more ambitious youngsters corning from the c. 326,000 (1937) Khmer Krom community in eastern Indochina {representing perhaps 10 per cent of the entire Khmer-speaking population) found that <i>in practice</i> they had very limited career prospects outside ‘Cambodge ‘. Thus Khmer and Lao might sit alongside Vietnamese in French-language secondary and tertiary schools in Saigon and Hanoi, but they were unlikely to go on to share administrative offices there. Like youngsters from Cotonou and Abidjan in Dakar, they were destined to go back, on graduation, to the ‘homes’ colonialism had demarcated for them. To put it another way, if their educational pilgrimages were directed towards Hanoi, their administrative journeys ended in Phnom Penh and Vientiane.
<br><br>
Out of these contradictions emerged those Khmer-speaking students who subsequently came to be remembered as the first Cambodian nationalists. The man who can reasonably be regarded as the ‘father’ of Khmer nationalism, Son Ngoc Thanh, was, as his Vietnamized name suggests, a Khmer Krom who was educated in Saigon and for a while held a minor judicial post in that city. But in the mid-1930s he abandoned the Paris of the Mekong Delta to seek a more promising future in its Blois. Prince Sisowath Youtevong attended secondary school in Saigon before leaving for France for further study. When he returned to Phnom Penh fifteen years later, after World War II, he helped to found the {Khmer) Democratic Party and served as Prime Minister in 1946-1947. His Defence Minister, Sonn Voeunnsai, undertook virtually the same journeys. Huy Kanthoul, Democratic Prime Minister in 1951-1952, had graduated from an <i>école normale</i> in Hanoi in 1931, and was then returned to Phnom Penh, where he eventually joined the Lycée Sisowath’s teaching staff.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> Perhaps most exemplary of all is the <b>(p.131)</b> figure of leu Koeus, first of a melancholy line of assassinated Khmer political leaders.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> Born in the province of Battambangin 1905-when it was still ruled from Bangkok- he attended a local ‘reformed pagoda school’ before entering an ‘Indochinese’ elementary school in Battambang town. In 1921, he proceeded to the Collège Sisowath in the Protectorate’s capital, and then to a <i>collège de commerce</i> in Hanoi, from which he graduated in 1927 at the top of his French-reading class. Hoping to study chemistry in Bordeaux, he took and passed the scholarship examination. But the colonial state blocked his way abroad. He returned to his native Battambang, where he ran a pharmacy, continuing to do so even after Bangkok regained the province in 1941. After the Japanese collapse in August 1945, he reappeared in ‘Cambodge’ as a Democratic parliamentarian. It is notable that he was in his way a lineal descendent of the illustrious philologists of an earlier Europe, insofar as he designed a typewriter keyboard for the Khmer script and published a weighty two-volume Phefsa Khmer [The Khmer Language], or as the misleading tide-page of the 1967 edition has it, <i>La Langue Cambodgienne (Un Essai d’étude raisonné)</i>.[34] But this text made its first appearance - volume 1 only - in 1947, when its author was Chairman of the Constituent Assembly in Phnom Penh, not in 1937, when he was vegetating in Battambang, when as yet no Khmer-speaking <i>lycéens</i> had been produced by the Lycée Sisowath, and when Indochina still had an ephemeral reality. By 1947, Khmer-speakers - at least those from ‘Cambodge’ - were no longer attending classes in Saigon or Hanoi. A new generation was coming on the scene for whom ‘Indochine’ was history and ‘Vietnam’ now a real and foreign country.
<br><br>
<sup>22</sup> In its final form, this script is usually attributed to the gifted lexicographer Alexandre de Rhodes, who in 1651 published his remarkable <i>Dictionarium annamiticum, lusitanum et latinum</i>.
<br><br>
<sup>23</sup> ‘[Most) French colonial officials of the late nineteenth century . . . were convinced that to achieve permanent colonial success required the harsh curtailment of Chinese influences, including the writing system. Missionaries often saw the Confucian literati as the main obstacle to the general Catholic conversion of Vietnam. Hence, in their view, to eliminate the Chinese language was simultaneously to isolate Vietnam from its heritage and to neutralize the traditional elite.’ (Marr, <i>Vietnamese Tradition</i>, p. 145). Kelly quotes one colonial writer thus: ‘in effect, the teaching of quoc ngu alone . . . will have the result of communicating to Vietnamese only the French writing, literature, and philosophy which we wish them [to be exposed to]. That is those [works] which we judge useful to them and easily assimilable: only the texts which we transcribe into quoc ngu. Franco-Vietnamese Schools’, p. 22.
<br><br>
<sup>24</sup> See Ibid., pp. 14-15. For a wider, lower stratum of the Indochinese population Governor-General Albert Sarraut (author of the 1917 Code of Public Instruction) urged: ‘a simple education, reduced to essentials permitting the child to learn all that will be useful to him to know in his humble career of farmer or artisan to ameliorate the natural and social conditions of his existence.’ Ibid., p. 17.
<br><br>
<sup>25</sup> In 1937, a total of 631 students were enrolled, 580 of them in the faculties of law and medicine. Ibid., p. 79; see also pp. 69-79, for the bizarre history of this institution, founded in 1906, closed in 1908, reopened in 1918, and never, till the late 1930s, much more than a glorified vocational college.
<br><br>
<sup>26</sup> As I shall be concentrating on Khmers and. Vietnamese below, this may be the place to make a brief reference to some prominent Lao. The present Prime Minister of Laos, Kaysone Phoumvihan attended the University of Hanoi’s medical faculty in the late 1930s. The head of state, Prince Souphanouvong, graduated from Hanoi’s Lycee Albert Sarraut before obtaining an engineering degree in metropolitan France. His elder brother, Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, who headed the short-lived Lao lssara (Free Lao) anticolonial government in Vientiane from October 1945 to April 1946, had as a youth been graduated from Saigon’s Lycée Chasseloup-Laubat. Prior to World War II, the highest educational institution in ‘Laos’ was the small College [i.e. junior high school] Pavie in Vientiane. See Joseph J. Zasloff, <i>Pathet Lao</i>, pp. 104-105; and ‘3349’ [pseudonym of Phetsarath Ratanavongsa], <i>Iron Man of Laos</i>, pp. 12 and 46. It is revealing, I think, that in his account of his later schooldays in Paris, Phetsarath regularly and unselfconsciously speaks of his identifiably Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese classmates as ‘the Indochinese students.’ See, e.g., ibid., pp. 14-15.
<br><br>
<sup>27</sup> Thus in the previously ‘integrated’ <i>lycées</i> Chasseloup-Laubat and Albert Sarraut, sub-standard ‘native sections’ were established in 1917-1918. These ‘native sections’ eventually turned respectively into the Lycée Petrus Ky and the Lycée du Protectorat. (Ibid., pp. 60-63). Nonetheless, a minority of privileged indigènes continued to attend the ‘real French’ <i>lycées</i> (the adolescent Norodom Sihanouk graced Chasseloup-Laubat), while a minority of ‘French’ (mainly Eurasians and natives with French legal status) attended Petrus Ky and its sister institution in Hanoi.
<br><br>
<sup>28</sup> Marr notes that in the 1920s ‘even the most optimistic member of the intelligentsia [committed to <i>quoc ngu</i>] could not have guessed that only two decades later, citizens of a Democratic Republic of Vietnam would be able to conduct all important affairs - political, military, economic, scientific and academic - in spoken Vietnamese linked to the <i>quoc ngu</i> writing system.’ <i>Vietnamese Tradition</i>, p. 150. It was also a disagreeable surprise to the French.
<br><br>
<sup>29</sup> It is instructive that one of the first issues raised by the early Khmer nationalists of the late 1930s was the ‘menace’ of a so-called ‘quoc ngu-ization’ of the Khmer script by the colonial authorities.
<br><br>
<sup>30</sup> The pattern was not immediately followed in Vientiane. Toye reports that in the course of the 1930s only 52 Lao were graduated from the College [he wrongly terms it Lycée] Pavie, as opposed to 96 Vietnamese. <i>Laos</i>, p. 45.
<br><br>
<sup>31</sup> It is possible that this influx paralleled the institution of the Franco-Vietnamese school system, in that it deflected Vietnamese from competing with French nationals in the more advanced, eastern parts of Indochina. In 1937, there were 39,000 Europeans living in ‘Cochin China,’ ‘Annam’ and ‘Tonkin,’ and only 3100 in ‘Cambodge’ and ‘Laos’ combined. Marr, <i>Vietnamese Tradition</i>, p. 23.
