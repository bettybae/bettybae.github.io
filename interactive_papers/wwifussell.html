A little more light has trickled through the mists that enclose the earth. But the sky has remained overcast, and now it dissolves in rain. With a slowness which itself disheartens, the wind brings back its great wet void upon us. The rain-haze makes everything clammy and dull even the Turkey red of Lamuse’s cheeks, and even the orange armour that caparisons Tulacque. The water penetrates to <b>(p.25)</b> the deep joy with which dinner endowed us, and puts it out. Space itself shrinks; and the sky, which is a field of melancholy, comes closely down upon the earth, which is a field of death. <br><br>We are still there, implanted and idle. It will be hard to-day to reach the end of it, to get rid of the afternoon. We shiver in discomfort, and keep shifting our positions, like cattle enclosed. <br><br>Cocon is explaining to his neighbour the arrangement and intricacy of our trenches. He has seen a military map and made some calculations. In the sector occupied by our regiment there are fifteen lines of French trenches. Some are abandoned, invaded by grass, and half levelled; the others solidly upkept and bristling with men. These parallels are joined up by innumerable galleries which hook and crook themselves like ancient streets. The system is much more dense than we believe who live inside it. On the twenty- five kilometres’ width that form the army front, one must count on a thousand kilometres of hollowed lines trenches and saps of all sorts. And the French Army consists of ten such armies. There are then, on the French side, about 10,000 kilometres [6250 miles] of trenches, and as much again on the German side. And the French front is only about one-eighth of the whole war-front of the world. <br><br>Thus speaks Cocon, and he ends by saying to his neighbour, “In all that lot, you see what we are, us chaps?” <br><br>Poor Barque’s head droops. His face, bloodless as a slum child’s, is underlined by a red goatee that punctuates his hair like an apostrophe : “Yes, it’s true, when you come to think of it. What’s a soldier, or even several soldiers?--Nothing, and less than nothing, in the whole crowd; and so we see ourselves lost,drowned, like the few drops of blood that we are among all this flood of men and things.” <br><br>Barque sighs and is silent . . . <br>Alternate Translation from Robin Buss, Penguin edition, 2003<br><br>The day comes on. A little more light has filtered through the mists that cover the earth. But the sky is overcast and now it dissolves in rain. The water vapour things out and falls. It drizzles down. The wind brings its great damp void back on us, with depressing slowness. The  fog and raindrops dampen and tarnish everything, even the roast-beef cheeks of Lamuse and the orange peel covering Tulacque; the water seeps into our very  depths, reaching the core of joy that the meal has brought us. Space has  shrunk and the field of sadness of the sky has clamped down on the earth, that field of death.<br><br>We are stuck here, idle. It will be hard to reach the end of today, to shake off the afternoon. We shiver uncomfortably, shifting on our feet, like cattle waiting at a gate.<br><br>Cocon is explaining to his neighbour how our trenches are laid out and linked together. He has seen a master plan and made some calculations. In the regiment’s sector there are fifteen lines of French trenches, some abandoned to the grass and almost filled in, others kept up and bristling with men. These parallel trenches are joined by countless linking ones that twist and turn like old passageways. The network is even more compact than we think, those of us who live in it. Across the twenty-five kilometres that form the front of our army,  there must be a thousand kilometres of trenchwork: trenches themselves, linking trenches and dugouts. And the French Army has ten armies. This means that there are around ten thousand kilometres of trenchwork on the French side and as much on the German . . . And the French front is only about one-eighth of the war front across the surface of the world.<br><br>That’s what Cocon says, turning to his neighbour in conclusion and saying: ‘And you see what we are in all that.’ Poor Barque, with his anaemic slum-kid’s face outlined by a red goatee and marked with a lock of hair like an apostrophe ... He lowers his head: ‘True, when you think about it. A soldier, or even lots of them, are nothing, or less than nothing in the mass and so we’re quite lost, drowned, like the few drops of blood we are in this deluge of men and things.’ Barque sighs and falls silent.'); break;

My first shell on the other hand left me unmoved, for it made so very little noise. True it was a small shell, but I had heard such bloodcurdling stories and felt pleasantly relieved.<br><br>The trenches themselves were more or less what I had expected. They were, in brief, just trenches, sandbagged and traversed. Behind them stood the gaunt ruin of a convent in whose watery cellars the company officers had their meals. Dinner in the evening was a pleasant diversion. The cook managed to produce, as a rule, four course out  out of army rations and any extras we had managed to pick up in the villages at the back. I always remember with gratitude an excellent savoury consisting of a French prune enwrapped in a papery slice of bacon. The floor of the cellar held some foot or so of water, and we sat on boxes with our feet piled on heaps of bricks, fortuitously collected by the batman. Night in the trenches was the most enduring experience of all. I can remember every detail with stark clarity. It was early March, and when I first arrived there was a spell of cold frosty weather. The relief of being able to stand up at full height without dyspeptic stoopings, the joy of being able to climb on the parapet or look undeterred over at the Germans, and wonder what was stirring in that alien land, made the nights worth waiting for. At intervals along the trench came the discreet glow of coal braziers, well screened. Round them sat the misty figures  of men off duty. One in every three men stood at the parapet on sentry duty. My task was intermittent — usually three hours on duty and three off, fooff, for sleep.<br><br>Those nights had a beauty of their own which will never be repeated. Our trenches stood on a faint slope, just overlooking German ground, with a vista of vague plainland below. Away to right and left stretched the great lines of defense as far as eye and imagination could stretch them. I used to wonder how long it would take for me to walk from the beaches of the North Sea to that curious end of all fighting against the Swiss boundary; to try to guess what each end looked like; to imagine what would happen if I passed a verbal message, in the manner of the parlor game, along to the next man on my right to be delivered to the end man of all up against the Alps. Would anything intelligible at all emerge?<br><br>The two lines and their no-man’s-land were clear and distinct, made obvious by the intermittent star-shells that never ceased being shot into the air. Sometimes for reassurance that nothing was brewing out in front, sometimes for my own sheer pleasure, I would take one of the great verey-light pistols that lay handy at intervals on the parapet and fire it into the sky.

Indeed until yesterday I was enwrapped in an awful complex muddle. Today I feel very much more settles. I have partially allayed my dilemma. I will record this, to me, and, no doubt, to Pewsham also, heartening, stimulating, wholly significant day.<br><br>Pewsham and I had agreed to meet and pursue our ambitions, or at any rate enquiries, as to the possibility of joining the Merchant Navy, with which Service I am deeply intrigued as a result of a chance meeting with a member of the M.N. as already explained.<br><br>Pewsham cycled from Dagenham over to my place, reaching here at 11.40 this morning. It was foggy, though the sun was making every effort to penetrate this typical London cover. Temporarily it succeeded. So in weather, to me so strangely elating, I dragged forth my old iron and together we wended our way past bomb-battered buildings into the City. We cycled via Holborn. The fog came down upon us from Clapham, and our eyes smarted and trickled. Down Whitehall, up Shaftesbury Avenue and along New Oxford Street. Certainly the damage was complete and widespread. Holborn was by far the worst. And as I cycled across Southhampton Row and by the Holborn Tube my mind flashed back to my momentous seventeeth birthday. I recalled longingly, comfortingly, even with unrestrained admiration and love my Lise: yet that day, as only yesterday, seemed sunk and trampled beneath the hoofs of time, under the indelible mark of the Nazis, and I knew she too was a Nazi, probably even as I thought so of her as I went amid the destruction of my City, Lise was in Germany, thinking ‘Gott strafe England.’ But I felt no hatred, no sympathy -- she was a memory, but an experience. She was a nurse, tending and healing the wounded Nazis that they may recuperate and live again as fodder for the German war machine. She did her duty to her country. She did what was right in her eyes. I respected her, and would have it of her. But this time I was not to meet her in the Tube - Pioneer Corps soldiers commanded my attention, slaving with pickaxe and spade, crane and drills to clear up this High Holborn of gutted buildings. Yet I thought more of the brief, spontaneous action of two crossing-sweepers who upon the passing of a hearse rased as one their sweeper’s hats until the coffin had passed. The dignity and bearing, the amount of feeling they displayed, unconsciously impressed itself deep into my mind. The <b>Ypres effect of Holborn</b> was drowned in their noble, generous act.'); break;

<center><b>Preface</b></center><br>
<br>
This book is about the British experience on the Western Front from 1914 to
1918 and some of the literary means by which it has been remembered, conventionalized,
and mythologized. It is also about the literary dimensions of the 
trench experience itself. Indeed, if the book had a subtitle, it would be something
like “An Inquiry into the Curious Literariness of Renal Life.” I have focused
on places and situations where literary tradition and real life notably transect,
and in doing so I have tried to understand something of the simultaneous
and reciprocal process by which life feeds materials to literature while literature
returns the favor by conferring forms upon life. And I have been concerned with
something more: the way the dynamics and iconography of the Great War have
proved crucial political, rhetorical, and artistic determinants on subsequent life.
At the same time the war was relying on inherited myth, it was generating new
myth, and that myth is part of the fiber of our own lives. <br>
<br>
In suggesting the forms of that myth, I have tried to supply contexts, both actual
and literary, for writers who have most effectively memorialized the Great
War as a historical experience with conspicuous imaginative and artistic meaning.
These writers I take to be the classic memoirists Siegfried Sassoon, Robert 
Graves and Edmund Blunden. I have dealt also with poets of very high literary
consciousness like David Jones, Isaac Rosenberg, and of course Wilfred Owen.
And to see what the or ordinary man as to say about it all, I have compared the
scores of amateur memoirs lodged in the collections of the Imperial War Museum. <br>
<br>
Correctly or not, the current idea of “the Great War” derives primarily from
images of the trenches in France and Belgium. I have thus stayed there with the
British infantry, largely disregarding events in Mesopotamia, Turkey, Africa,
and Ireland, and largely ignoring air and naval warfare. By thus narrowing my <b>(p.x)</b> 
view, I have hoped to sharpen it to probe into the origins of what some future
“medievalist” may call The Matter of Flanders and Picardy. <br>
<br>
My work on this book has been eased by the kindness of three institutions.
The Research Council of Rutgers University again has my thanks, especially its
amiable and responsive Associate Director, C. F. Main, who has also read the
proofs. I am indebted to the National Endowment for the Humanities for a Senior
Fellowship during the academic year 1973-74. And I owe a great deal –to the
Imperial War Museum and its courteous staff, especially D. G. Lance, Keeper of
Libraries and Archives, and Roderick Suddaby, Chief of the Documents Section.
Although occasionally I have dissented from some of their findings, I could
never have written without Bernard Bergonzi’s <i>Heroes’ Twilight</i>, John H. Johnston’s
<i>English Poetry of the First World War</i>, and Arthur E. Lane’s <i>An Adequate
Response</i>. An inquirer into this subject is lucky to have such predecessors. He is
lucky too to have as a general guide the <i>History of the First World War</i> by the admirable
B. H. Liddell Hart, prince of modern military critics. Throughout I
have drawn on the criticism of Northrop Frye. I am grateful for his work. For
answering queries and for donating ideas and criticism, I want to thank Paul Bertram,
Christopher Bond, Catharine Carver, Maurice Charney, Joseph Frank,
Robert Hollander, Alfred L. Kellogg, John McCormick, Peter McCormick,
Lawrence Millman, Julian Moynahan, George A. Panichas, Richard Quaintance,
James Raimes, George Robinson, and Mary E. Slayton. I remember with delight
Leo Cooper and Tom Hartman, generous companions during a tour of the
Somme. As usual, I am indebted to Richard Poirier, who contributed some materials
stemming from his own authoritative work on Norman Mailer. I am grateful
to the following authors and heirs for permission to quote unpublished material
as well as for the documents and memorabilia they have kindly sent me: Mrs.
David Angus, G. Bricknall, William Collins, Howard H. Cooper, M. J. H.
Drummond, Marjorie H. Gilbertson, the Rev. S. Horsley, Colonel R. Macleod,
R. R. B. Mecredy, D. M. Mitchell, W. R. Price, Peter Reeve, M. E. Ryder, and
Clive Watts. And David Holt has suggested important corrections. <br>
<br>
As always, it is to Betty that I owe the most. She has sustained me generously
with interest, encouragement, criticism, and much more.<br>

<center>THE TRENCH SCENE</center><br>
<br>
The idea of “the trenches” has been assimilated so successfully by metaphor
and myth (“Georgian complacency died in the trenches”) that it is
not easy now to recover a feeling for the actualities. <i>Entrenched</i>, in an
expression like <i>entrenched power</i>, has been a dead metaphor so long that
we must bestir ourselves to recover its literal sense. It is time to take a
tour. <br>
<br>
From the winter of 1914 until the spring of 1918 the trench system
was fixed, moving here and there a few hundred yards, moving on great
occasions as much as a few miles. London stationers purveying maps felt
secure in stocking “sheets of ‘The Western Front’ with a thick wavy
black line drawn from North to South alongside which was printed ‘British
Line.’”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1]</a> If one could have gotten high enough to look down at the
whole line at once, one would have seen a series of multiple parallel excavations
running for 400 miles down through Belgium and France,
roughly in the shape of an <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-100"><i>S</i></a> flattened at the sides and tipped to the left.
From the North Sea coast of Belgium the line wandered southward,
bulging out to contain <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a>, then dropping down to protect <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">Béthune</a>,
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">Arras</a>, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>. It continued south in front of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">Montidier</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">Compiègne</a>,
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">Soissons</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-111">Rheims</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-110">Verdun</a>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-109">St. Mihiel</a>, and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-108">Nancy</a>, and finally attached
its southernmost end to the Swiss border at Beurnevisin, in Alsace. The
top forty miles—the part north of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a>—was held by the Belgians; the
next ninety miles, down to the river Ancre, were British; the French
held the rest, to the south.
<b>(p.37)</b> Henri Barbusse estimates that the French front alone contained about
6250 miles of trenches.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> Since the French occupied a little more than half
the line, the total length of the numerous trenches occupied by the British
must come to about 6000 miles. We thus find over 12,000 miles of
trenches on the Allied side alone. When we add the trenches of the Central
Powers, we arrive at a figure of about 25,000 miles, equal to a trench
sufficient to circle the earth. Theoretically it would have been possible to
walk from Belgium to Switzerland entirely below ground, but although
the lines were “continuous,” they were not entirely seamless: occasionally
mere shell holes or fortified strong-points would serve as a
connecting link. Not a few survivors have performed the heady imaginative
exercise of envisioning the whole line at once. Stanley Casson is one
who, imagining the whole line from his position on the ground, implicitly
submits the whole preposterous conception to the criterion of the
“normally” rational and intelligible. As he remembers looking back from
1935,
<blockquote>Our trenches stood on a faint slope, just overlooking German ground, with a
vista of vague plainland below. Away to right and left stretched the great
lines of defense as far as eye and imagination could stretch them. I used to
wonder how long it would take for me to walk from the beaches of the
North Sea to that curious end of all fighting against the Swiss boundary; to
try to guess what each end looked like; to imagine what would happen if I
passed a verbal message, in the manner of the parlor game, along to the next
man on my right to be delivered to the end man of all up against the Alps.
Would anything intelligible at all emerge?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a></blockquote>

Another imagination has contemplated a similar absurd transmission of
sound all the way from north to south. Alexander Aitken remembers the
Germans opposite him celebrating some happy public event in early
June, 1916, presumably either the (ambiguous) German success at the
naval battle of Jutland (May 31-June 1) or the drowning of Lord Kitchener,
lost on June 5 when the cruiser <i>Hampshire</i> struck a mine and sank
off the Orkney Islands. Aitken writes, “There had been a morning in
early June when a tremendous tin-canning and beating of shell-gongs
had begun in the north and run south down their lines to end, without
doubt, at Belfort and Mulhausen on the Swiss frontier.” <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> Impossible to
believe, really, but in this mad setting, somehow plausible. <br>
<br>
The British part of the line was normally populated by about 800 battalions
of 1000 men each. They were concentrated in the two main sectors
of the British effort: the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> Salient in Flanders and the Somme
area in Picardy. Memory has given these two sectors the appearance of
<b>(p.40)</b> two distinguishable worlds. The Salient, at its largest point about nine
miles wide and projecting some four miles into the German line, was notable
for its terrors of concentrated, accurate artillery fire. Every part of
it could be covered from three sides, and at night one saw oneself almost
surrounded by the circle of white and colored Very lights sent up by the
Germans to illuminate the ground in front of their trenches or to signal
to the artillery behind them. The “rear area” at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> was the battered
city itself, where the troops harbored in cellars or in the old fortifications
built by Vauban in the seventeenth century. It was eminently available
to the German guns, and by the end of the war <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> was flattened to
the ground, its name a byword for a city totally destroyed. Another war
later, in 1940, Colin Perry—who was not born until four years after the
Great War—could look at the ruins of London and speak of “the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a>
effect of Holborn.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> If the character of the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> sector was concentration
and enclosure, inducing claustrophobia even above ground, the
Somme was known—at least until July 1, 1916—for its greater amplitude
and security. German fire came generally from only one direction;
and troops at rest could move further back. But then there was the
Somme mud; although the argument about whether the mud wasn’t really
worse at <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> was never settled.<br>
<br>	
Each of these two sectors had its symbolic piece of ruined public architecture.
At <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> it was the famous Cloth Hall, once a masterpiece of
medieval Flemish civic building. Its gradual destruction by artillery and
its pathetic final dissolution were witnessed by hundreds of thousands,
who never forgot this eloquent emblem of what happens when war
collides with art. In the Somme the memorable ruined work of architecture,
connoting this time the collision of the war with religion and the
old pieties, was the battered Basilica in the town of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>, or “Bert,” as
the troops called it. The grand if rather vulgar red and white brick edifice
had been built a few years before the war, the result of a local ecclesiastic’s
enthusiasm. Together with his townsmen he hoped that <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>
might become another Lourdes. Before the war 80,000 used to come on
pilgrimages to <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a> every year. The object of veneration inside the
church was a statue of the Virgin, said to have been found in the Middle
Ages by a local shepherd. But the statue of the Virgin never forgotten by
the hordes of soldiers who passed through <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a> was the colossal gilded
one on top of the battered tall tower of the Basilica. This figure, called
Notre Dame des Brebières, originally held the infant Christ in outstretched
arms above her; but now the whole statue was bent down
below the horizontal, giving the effect of a mother about to throw her
child—in disgust? in sacrifice?—into the debris-littered street below. To
<b>(p.41)</b> Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the War Committee, it was “a
most pathetic sight.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> Some said that the statue had been bent down by
French engineers to prevent the Germans from using it to aim at.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> But
Most—John Masefield among them—preferred to think it a victim of
German artillery.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a> Its obvious symbolic potential (which I will deal with
later) impressed itself even on men who found they could refer to it only
facetiously, as “The Lady of the Limp.” <br>
<br>
The two main British sectors duplicated each other also in their almost
symbolic road systems. Each had a staging town behind: for <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> it was
Poperinghe (to the men, “Pop”); for the Somme, Amiens. From these
towns troops proceeded with augmenting but usually well-concealed terror
up a sinister road to the town of operations, either <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> itself or <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>.
And running into the enemy lines out of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a> were the
most sinister roads of all, one leading to Menin, the other to Bapaume,
both in enemy territory. These roads defined the direction of ultimate attack
and the hoped-for breakout. They were the goals of the bizarre inverse
quest on which the soldiers were ironically embarked. <br>
<br>
But most of the time they were not questing. They were sitting or
lying or squatting in place below the level of the ground. “When all is
said and done,” Sassoon notes, “the war was mainly a matter of holes
and ditches.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> And in these holes and ditches extending for ninety
miles, continually, even in the quietest times, some 7000 British men
and officers were killed and wounded daily, just as a matter of course.
“Wastage;” the Staff called it. <br>
<br>
There were normally three lines of trenches. The front-line trench
was anywhere from fifty yards or so to a mile from its enemy counterpart.
Several hundred yards behind it was the support trench line. And
several hundred yards behind that was the reserve line. There were three
kinds of trenches: firing trenches, like these; communication trenches,
running roughly perpendicular to the line and connecting the three lines;
and “saps,” shallower ditches thrust out into No Man’s Land, providing
access to forward observation posts, listening posts, grenade-throwing
posts, and machine, gun positions. The end of a sap was usually not
manned all the time: night was the favorite time for going out. Coming
up from the rear, one reached the trenches by following a communication
trench sometimes a mile or more long. It often began in a
town and gradually deepened. By the time pedestrians reached the reserve
line, they were well below ground level. <br>
<br>
A firing trench was supposed to be six to eight feet deep and four or
five feet wide. On the enemy side a parapet of earth or sandbags rose
about two or three feet above the ground. A corresponding “parados” a
<b>(p.42)</b> foot or so high was often found on top of the friendly side. Into the sides
of trenches were dug one- or two-man holes (”funk-holes”), and there
were deeper dugouts, reached by dirt stairs, for use as command posts
and officers’ quarters. On the enemy side of a trench was a fire-step two
feet high on which the defenders were supposed to stand, firing and
throwing grenades, when repelling attack. A well-built trench did not
run straight for any distance: that would have been to invite enfilade fire.
Every few yards a good trench zig-zagged. It had frequent traverses
designed to contain damage within a limited space. Moving along a
trench thus involved a great deal of weaving and turning. The floor of a
proper trench was covered with wooden duckboards, beneath which
were sumps a few feet deep designed to collect water. The walls, perpetually
crumbling, were supported by sandbags, corrugated iron, or bundles
of sticks or rushes. Except at night and in half-light, there was of
course no looking over the top except through periscopes, which could
be purchased in the “Trench Requisites” section of the main London
department stores. The few snipers on duty during the day observed No
Man’s Land through loopholes cut in sheets of armor plate. <br>
<br>
The entanglements of barbed wire had to be positioned far enough out
in front of the trench to keep the enemy from sneaking up to grenade-throwing
distance. Interestingly, the two novelties that contributed most
to the personal menace of the war could be said to be American inventions.
Barbed wire had first appeared on the American frontier in the late
nineteenth century for use in restraining animals. And the machine gun
was the brainchild of Hiram Stevens Maxim (1840-1916), an American
who, disillusioned with native patent law, established his Maxim Gun
Company in England and began manufacturing his guns in 1889. He
was finally knighted for his efforts. At first the British regard for barbed
wire was on a par with Sir Douglas Haig’s understanding of the machine
gun. In the autumn of 1914, the first wire Private Frank Richards saw
emplaced before the British positions was a single strand of agricultural
wire found in the vicinity.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> Only later did the manufactured article
begin to arrive from England in sufficient quantity to create the thickets
of mock-organic rusty brown that helped give a look of eternal autumn to
the front. <br>
<br>
The whole British line was numbered by sections, neatly, from right
to left. A section, normally occupied by a company, was roughly 300
yards wide. One might be occupying front-line trench section 51; or support
trench S 51, behind it; or reserve trench SS 51, behind both. But a
less formal way of identifying sections of trench was by place or street
names with a distinctly London flavor. <i>Piccadilly</i> was a favorite; popular
<b>(p.43)</b> also were <i>Regent Street</i> and <i>Strand</i>; junctions were <i>Hyde Park Corner</i> and
<i>Marble Arch</i>. Greater wit-and deeper homesickness-sometimes surfaced
in the naming of the German trenches opposite. Sassoon remembers
“Durley”’s account of the attack at Delville Wood in September, 
1916: “Our objective was Pint Trench, taking Bitter and Beer and
clearing Ale and Vat, and also Pilsen Lane.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> Directional and traffic
control signs were everywhere in the trenches, giving the whole system
the air of a parody modern city, although one literally “underground.” <br>
<br>
The trenches I have described are more or less ideal, although not so
ideal as the famous exhibition trenches dug in Kensington Gardens for
the edification of the home front. These were clean, dry, and well furnished,
with straight sides and sandbags neatly aligned. R. E. Vernede
writes his wife from the real trenches that a friend of his has just returned
from viewing the set of ideal ones. He “found he had never seen
anything at all like it before.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> And Wilfred Owen calls the Kensington
Gardens trenches “the laughing stock of the army.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> Explaining military
routines to civilian readers, Ian Hay labors to give the impression that
the real trenches are identical to the exhibition ones and that they are
properly described in the language of normal domesticity a bit archly
deployed: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The firing-trench is our place of business—our office in the city, so to speak.
The supporting trench is our suburban residence, whither the weary toiler
may betake himself periodically (or, more correctly, in relays) for purposes
of refreshment and repose.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a></blockquote> <br>
<br>
The reality was different. The British trenches were wet, cold,
smelly, and thoroughly squalid. Compared with the precise and thorough
German works, they were decidedly amateur, reflecting a complacency
about the British genius for improvisation. Since defense offered
little opportunity for the display of pluck or swank, it was by implication
derogated in the officers’ <i>Field Service Pocket Book</i>. One reason the British
trench system was so haphazard and ramshackle was that it had originally
taken form in accord with the official injunction: “The choice of a
[defensive] position and its preparation must be made with a view to
economizing the power expended on defense in order that the power of
offense may be increased.” And it was considered really useless to build
solid fortifications anyway: “An occasional shell may strike and penetrate
the parapet, but in the case of shrapnel the damage to the parapet will be
trifling, while in the case of a shell filled with high explosive, the effect
will be no worse on a thin parapet than on a thick one. It is, therefore,
useless to spend time and labor on making a thick parapet simply to keep <br>
<br>
<b>(p.44)</b> <b>The King inspecting model trenches at the Australian school near Sailly, August 1916 (Imperial War Museum)</b><br>
<br>
out shell.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a> The repeatedly revived hopes for a general breakout and
pursuit were another reason why the British trenches were so shabby. A
typical soldier’s view is George Coppard’s: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The whole conduct of our trench warfare seemed to be based on the concept
that we, the British, were not stopping in the trenches for long, but were
tarrying awhile on the way to Berlin and that very soon we would be chasing
Jerry across country. The result, in the long term, meant that we lived a
mean and impoverished sort of existence in lousy scratch holes.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a></blockquote> <br>
<br>
In contrast, the German trenches, as the British discovered during the
attack on the Somme, were deep, clean, elaborate, and sometimes even
comfortable. As Coppard found on the Somme, “Some of the [German]
dugouts were thirty feet deep, with as many as sixteen bunk-beds, as
well as door bells, water tanks with taps, and cupboards and mirrors.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a>
They also had boarded walls, floors, and ceilings; finished wooden staircases;
electric light; real kitchens; and wallpaper and overstuffed furniture,
the whole protected by steel .outer doors. Foreign to the British
style was a German dugout of the sort recalled by Ernst Jünger: <br>
<br>
<b>A trench on the Somme (lmperial War Museum)</b> <br>
<br>
<b>(p.45)</b> <br>
<br><blockquote>At Monchy . . . I was master of an underground dwelling approached by
forty steps hewn in the solid chalk, so that even the heaviest shells at this
depth made no more than a pleasant rumble when we sat there over an interminable
game of cards. In one wall I had a bed hewn out. . . . . At its
head hung an electric light so that I could read in comfort till I was sleepy.
. . . The whole was shut off from the outer world by a dark-red curtain
with rod and rings. . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> </blockquote> <br>
<br>
As these examples suggest, there were “national styles” in trenches as in
other things. The French trenches were nasty, cynical, efficient, and
temporary. Kipling remembered the smell of delicious cooking emanating
from some in Alsace.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> The English were amateur, vague, <i>ad hoc</i>, and
temporary. The German were efficient, clean, pedantic, and permanent.
Their occupants proposed to stay where they were. <br>
<br>
Normally the British troops rotated trench duty. After a week of
“rest” behind the lines, a unit would move up—at night—to relieve a
unit in the front-line trench. After three days to a week or more in that
position, the unit would move back for a similar length of time to the
support trench, and finally back to the reserve. Then it was time for a
<b>(p.46)</b>
week of rest again. In the three lines of trenches the main business of the
soldier was to exercise self-control while being shelled. As the poet Louis
Simpson has accurately remembered: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Being shelled is the main work of an infantry soldier, which no one talks
about. Everyone has his own way of going about it. In general, it means
lying face down and contracting your body into as small a space as possible.
In novels [<i>The Naked and the Dead</i> is an example] you read about soldiers, at
such moments, fouling themselves. The opposite is true. As all your parts
are contracting, you are more likely to be constipated.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a></blockquote> <br>
<br>
Simpson is recalling the Second War, but he might be recalling the First.
While being shelled, the soldier either harbored in a dugout and hoped
for something other than a direct hit or made himself as small as possible
in a funk-hole. An unlucky sentry or two was supposed to be out in the
open trench in all but the worst bombardments, watching through a
periscope or loophole for signs of an attack. When only light shelling was
in progress, people moved about the trenches freely, and we can get an
idea of what life there was like if we posit a typical twenty-four hours in
a front-line trench.<br>
<br>The day began about an hour before first light, which often meant at
about 4:30. This was the moment for the invariable ritual of mormng
stand-to (short for the archaic formal command for repelling attack,
“Stand to Arms”). Since dawn was the favorite time for launching attacks,
at the order to stand-to everyone, officers, men, forward artillery
observers, visitors, mounted the fire-step, weapon ready, and peered
toward the German line. When it was almost full light and clear that the
Germans were not going to attack that morning, everyone “stood down”
and began preparing breakfast in small groups. The rations of tea, bread,
and bacon, brought up in sandbags during the night, were broken out.
The bacon was fried in mess-tin lids over small, and if possible smokeless,
fires. If the men were lucky enough to be in a division whose commanding
general permitted the issue of the dark and strong government
rum, it was doled out from a jar with the traditional iron spoon, each
man receiving about two tablespoonsful. Some put it into their tea, but
most swallowed it straight. It was a precious thing, and serving it out
was almost like a religious ceremonial, as David Jones recalls in <i>In Parenthesis</i>,
where a corporal is performing the rite: <br>
<br>
O have a care—don’t spill the precious<br>
O don’t jog his hand-ministering;<br>
do take care.<br>
O please—give the poor bugger elbow room. <br>
<br>
<b>(p.47)</b> Larger quantities might be issued to stimulate troops for an assault, and
one soldier remembers what the air smelled like during a British attack:
“Pervading the air was the smell of rum and blood.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> In 1922 one medical
officer deposed before a parliamentary committee investigating the
phenomenon of “shell shock”: “Had it not been for the rum ration I do
not think we should have won the war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22]</a> <br>
<br>
During the day the men cleaned weapons and repaired those parts of
the trench damaged during the night. Or they wrote letters, deloused
themselves, or slept. The officers inspected, encouraged, arid strolled
about looking nonchalant to inspirit the men. They censored the men’s
letters and dealt with the quantities of official inquiries brought them
daily by runner. How many pipe-fitters had they in their company?
Reply immediately. How many hairdressers, chiropodists, bicycle repairmen?
Daily “returns” of the amount of ammunition and the quantity
of trench stores had to be made. Reports of the nightly casualties had to
be sent back. And letters of condolence, which as the war went on
became form-letters of condolence, had to be written to the relatives of
the killed and wounded. Men went to and fro on sentry duty or working
parties, but no one showed himself above the trench. After evening
stand-to, the real work began. <br>
<br>
Most of it was above ground. Wiring parties repaired the wire in front
of the position. Digging parties extended saps toward the enemy. Carrying
parties brought up not just rations and mail but the heavy engineering
materials needed for the constant repair and improvement of the
trenches: timbers, A-frames, duckboards, stakes and wire, corrugated
iron, sandbags, tarpaulins, pumping equipment. Bombs and ammunition
and flares were carried forward. All this ant-work was illuminated
brightly from time to time by German flares and interrupted very
frequently by machine gun or artillery fire. Meanwhile night patrols and
raiding parties were busy in No Man’s Land. As morning approached,
there was a nervous bustle to get the jobs done in time, to finish fitting
the timbers, filling the sandbags, pounding in the stakes, and then returning
mauls and picks and shovels to the Quartermaster Sergeant. By
the time of stand-to, nothing human was visible above ground anywhere,
but every day each side scrutinized the look of the other’s line for significant
changes wrought by night. <br>
<br>
Flanders and Picardy have always been notorious for dampness. It is
not the least of the ironies of the war for the British that their trenches
should have been dug where the water-table was the highest and the annual
rainfall the most copious. Their trenches were always wet and often
flooded several feet deep. Thigh-boots or waders were issued as standard <br>
<br><b>(p.48)</b> 
<b>Duckboards going forward over flooded trenches near Pilckem, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> Salient, October
1917. (Imperial War Museum)</b> <br>
<br>
articles of uniform. Wilfred Owen writes his mother from the Somme at
the beginning of 1917: “The waders are of course indispensable. In 2 1/2
miles of trench which I waded yesterday there was not one inch of dry
ground. There is a mean depth of two feet of water.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> Pumps worked
day and night but to little effect. Rumor held that the Germans not only
could make it rain when they wanted it to—that is, all the time—but had
contrived some shrewd technical method for conducting the water in
their lines into the British positions—perhaps piping it underground. Ultimately
there was no defense against the water but humor. “Water knee
deep and up to the waist in places,” one soldier notes in his diary.
“Rumors of being relieved by the Grand Fleet.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> One doesn’t want to
dwell excessively on such discomforts, but here it will do no harm to try
to imagine what, in these conditions, going to the latrine was like. <br>
<br>
The men were not the only live things in the line. They were accompanied
everywhere by their lice, which the professional delousers in rest
positions behind the lines, with their steam vats for clothes and hot baths
for troops, could do little to eliminate. The entry <i>lousy</i> in Eric Partridge’s
<i>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</i> speaks volumes: “Contemptible;
mean; filthy. . . . Standard English till 20th C, when, especially
<b>(p.49)</b>
after the Great War, colloquial and used as a mere pejorative.” <i>Lousy
with</i>, meaning <i>full of</i>, was “originally military” and entered the colloquial
word-hoard around 1915: “That ridge is lousy with Fritz.” <br>
<br> 
The famous rats also gave constant trouble. They were big and black,
with wet, muddy hair. They fed largely on the flesh of cadavers and on
dead horses. One shot them with revolvers or coshed them to death with
pick-handles. Their hunger, vigor, intelligence, and courage are recalled
in numerous anecdotes. One officer notes from the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> Salient: “We
are fairly plagued with rats. They have eaten nearly everything in the
mess, including the table-cloth and the operations orders! We borrowed
a large cat and shut it up at night to exterminate them, and found the
place empty next morning. The rats must have eaten it up, bones, fur,
and all, and dragged it to their holes.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a> <br>
<br>
One can understand rats eating heartily there. It is harder to understand 
men doing so. The stench of rotten flesh was over everything,
hardly repressed by the chloride of lime sprinkled on particularly offensive 
sites. Dead horses and dead men—and parts of both—were sometimes
not buried for months and often simply became an element of parapets
and trench walls. You could smell the front line miles before you
could see it. Lingering pockets of gas added to the unappetizing atmosphere.
Yet men ate three times a day, although what they ate reflected
the usual gulf between the ideal and the actual. The propagandist
George Adam announced with satisfaction that “the food of the army is
based upon the conclusions of a committee, upon which sat several eminent
scientists.” The result, he asserted, is that the troops are “better fed
than they are at home.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Officially, each man got daily: <br>
<br>
1 1/4 pounds fresh meat (or 1 pound preserved meat),<br>
I 1/4 pounds bread,<br>
4 ounces bacon,<br>
3 ounces cheese,<br>
1/2 pound fresh vegetables (or 2 ounces dried), <br>
<br>
together with small amounts of tea, sugar, and jam. But in the trenches
there was very seldom fresh meat, not for eating, anyway; instead there
was “Bully” (tinned corned-beef) or “Maconochie” (ma-con’ -o-chie), a
tinned meat-and-vegetable stew named after its manufacturer. If they
did tend to grow tedious in the long run, both products were surprisingly
good. The troops seemed to like the Maconochie best, but the Germans
favored the British corned beef, seldom returning from a raid on
the British lines without taking back as much as they could carry. On
trench duty the British had as little fresh bread as fresh meat. “Pearl Biscuits”
<b>(p.50)</b> were the substitute. They reminded the men of dog biscuits, although,
together with the Bully beef, they were popular with the French
and Belgian urchins, who ran (or more often strolled) alongside the railway
trains bringing troops up to the front, soliciting gifts by shouting,
“Tommee! Bull-ee! Bee-skee!” When a company was out of the line, it
fed better. It was then serviced by its company cookers-stoves on
wheels-and often got something approaching the official ration, as it
might also in a particularly somnolent part of the line, w.hen hot food
might come up at night in the large covered containers known as Dixies. <br>
<br>
Clothing and equipment improved as the war went on, although at the
outset there was a terrible dearth and improvisation. During the retreat
from Mons, as Frank Richards testifies, “A lot of us had no caps: I was
wearing a handkerchief knotted at the four corners-the only headgear I
was to wear for some time.” Crucial supplies had been omitted: “We had
plenty of small-arm ammunition but no rifle-oil or rifle-rag to clean our
rifles with. We used to cut pieces off our shirts ... and some of us who
had bought small tins of Vaseline . . . for use on sore heels or chafed
legs, used to grease our rifles with that.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> At the beginning line officers
dressed very differently from the men. They wore riding-boots or
leather puttees; melodramatically cut riding breeches; and flare-skirted
tunics with Sam Browne belts. Discovering that this costume made them
special targets in attacks (German gunners were instructed to fire first at
the people with the thin knees), by the end they were dressing like the
troops, wearing wrap puttees; straight trousers bloused below the knee;
Other Ranks’ tunics with inconspicuous insignia, no longer on the cuffs
but on the shoulders; and Other Ranks’ web belts and haversacks. In
1914 both officers and men wore peaked caps, and it was rakish for
officers to remove the grommet for a “Gorblimey” effect. Steel helmets
were introduced at the end of 1915, giving the troops, as Sassoon observed,
“a Chinese look.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> Herbert Read found the helmets “the only
poetic thing in the British Army, for they are primeval in design and effect,
like iron mushrooms.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> A perceptive observer could date corpses
and skeletons lying on disused battlefields by their evolving dress. A
month before the end of the war, Major P. H. Pilditch recalls, he <br>
<br>
<blockquote> 
spent some time in the old No Man’s Land of four years’ duration .... It
was a morbid but intensely interesting occupation tracing the various battles
amongst the hundreds of skulls, bones and remains scattered thickly about.
The progress of our successive attacks could be clearly seen from the types
of equipment on the skeletons, soft cloth caps denoting the 1914 and early
1915 fighting, then respirators, then steel helmets marking attack in 1916.
Also Australian slouch hats, used in the costly and abortive attack in 1916.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> </blockquote><br>
<br>
<b>(p.51)</b>
To be in the trenches was to experience an unreal, unforgettable enclosure
and constraint, as well as a sense of being unoriented and lost.
One saw two things only: the walls of an unlocalized, undifferentiated
earth and the sky above. Fourteen years after the war J. R. Ackerley was
wandering through an unfrequented part of a town in India. “The streets
became narrower and narrower as I turned and turned,” he writes, “until
I felt I was back in the trenches, the houses upon either side being so
much of the same color and substance as the rough ground between.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> 
That lost feeling is what struck Major Frank Isherwood, who writes his
wife in December, 1914: “The trenches are a labyrinth, I have already
lost myself repeatedly. . . . you can’t get out of them and walk about
the country or see anything at all but two muddy walls on each side of
you.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> What a survivor of the Salient remembers fifty years later are
the walls of dirt and the ceiling of sky, and his eloquent optative cry rises
as if he were still imprisoned there: “To be out of this present, ever present,
eternally present misery, this stinking world of sticky, trickling
earth ceilinged by a strip of threatening sky.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-33">[33]</a> As the only visible theater
of variety, the sky becomes all-important. It was the sight of the
sky, almost alone, that had the power to persuade a man that he was not
already lost in a common grave. <br>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> SUNRISE AND SUNSET</i></b></center><br>
<br>Morning and evening stand-to’s were the occasions when the sky especially
offered itself for observation and interpretation. Stand-to was a solemn
moment. Twice a day everyone stared silently across tile wasteland
at the enemy’s hiding places and considered how to act if a field-gray line
suddenly appeared and grew larger and larger through the mist and the
half-light. Twice a day everyone enacted this ritual of alert defense that
served to dramatize what he was in the trench for and that couldn’t help
emphasizing the impossibility of escape. The “peculiar significance” of
stand-to is one thing David Jones particularly remembers: <br>
<br>
<blockquote> 
 [The] procedure was strict and binding anywhere in the forward zone,
under any circumstances whatever .... So that the hour occurring twice in
the twenty-four . . . was one of peculiar significance and there was attaching
to it a degree of solemnity, in that one was conscious that from the
sea dunes to the mountains, everywhere, on the whole front the two opposing
lines stood alertly, waiting any eventuality.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-34">[34]</a> </blockquote>
<br>
<br>
The hour of stand-to constituted a highly ritualized distillation of the 
state of anxious stalemate and the apparently absolute equivalence of
<b>(p.52)</b> force that had led to the stasis of mutual entrenchment. The hour was
memorable as an emblem of the political essence of the war itself, for
morning and evening stand-to’s evened out the advantages possessed by
either side. In the morning, the advantage lay with the British side as the
rising sun ahead silhouetted belated German patrols and working parties.
In the evening, as the sun went down behind the British lines, the Germans
 had the advantage: they could catch the silhouettes of the nightly
ration and working parties starting out too early. <br>
<br>What one stared at twice daily for years on end, thus, was sunrise and
sunset. “We have a unique opportunity of viewing sunrise and sunset in
the trenches,” writes Hugh Quigley, “owing to the decree that men must
stand-to at daybreak and nightfall.” And if Flanders was flat and wet, it
had the distinction of offering terrain and weather productive of superb
dawns and dusks. “I have never seen such glorious vistas of sunset or
sunrise as in this country,” Quigley continues. “Its flatness gathers up
everything to the world overhead and adds a great depth and shimmering
distance to the gold, rose, and green, touching them finely to delicate
gleam.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-35">[35]</a> Quigley’s vision is that of a painterly Nineties aesthete-the
very first words in his Passchendaele and the Somme (1928) are “At sunset
we passed by the lake”-but even so practical a countryman as Sassoon
recalls thinking once at evening stand-to that “the sky was one of the
redeeming features of the war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-36">[36]</a> Christopher Tietjens, in Ford Madox
Ford’s A Man Could Stand Up-, notices that observing from a trench
makes the sky overhead and to the front especially brilliant: <br>
<br></blockquote>
Twice he had stood up on a rifleman’s step enforced by a bully-beef case
to look over .... Each time, on stepping down again, he had been struck
by that phenomenon: the light seen from the trench seemed, if not brighter,
then more definite. So, from the bottom of a pit-shaft in broad day you can
see the stars.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-37">[37]</a> </blockquote><br>
<br> 
It was a cruel reversal that sunrise and sunset, established by over a
century of Romantic poetry and painting as the tokens of hope and peace
and rural charm, should now be exactly the moments of heightened ritual
anxiety. What literate young man could forget, during the hour of
stand-to, the sunrises of Blake and Shelley, of Tennyson and Arnold,
the sunsets of Wordsworth and Byron and Browning, and even of Sir
Henry Newbolt? Those attentive to the history of taste know that skyawareness
is a fairly late development. There is little of it, for example,
in the eighteenth century, which felt no pressing need for· such emblems
of infinity as sky or sea. The crucial document in the history of British
awareness of the sky is Ruskin’s <i>Modern Painters</i>, the five volumes of
<b>(p.52)</b>
which appeared from 1843 to 186o. And the crucial place in Modern
Painters is the chapter “Of the Open Sky” in the first volume. <br>
<br>
Here Ruskin asserts that hitherto no one has paid sufficient attention
to the sky, and that we have thus missed much of what Nature has to tell
us for our moral benefit. The effects of the sky, he says, are “intended”
by their “Maker and Doer” for our pleasure as well as our moral instruction.
The sky speaks universally to the human heart, “soothing it and
purifying it from its dross and dust.” And the great exponent of the sky’s
moral work is the painter J. M. W. Turner. His renderings of sunrise
and sunset are far superior to those of Claude Lorraine, and for Ruskin
the painter of such effects is a master artist whose achievements in light
and color imitate those of God himself in His most earnest pedagogic
moments.<br>
<br>
<i>Modern Painters</i> was immensely influential in establishing the visual
taste of the Victorians and their successors. Charlotte Bronte wrote of it:
“This book seems to give me eyes,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-38">[38]</a> and she was followed by several
generations uniquely devoted to observing sunrise and sunset with an almost
mystical enthusiasm. Oscar Wilde’s “The Decay of Lying” (1889)
implies the continuing vogue of sunsets among the popularly educated:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Yesterday evening Mrs. Arundel insisted on my going to the window and
looking at the glorious sky, as she called it. Of course I had to look at it. She
is one of those absurdly pretty Philistines to whom one can deny nothing.
And what was it? It was simply a very second-rate Turner, a Turner of a
bad period, with all the painter’s worst faults exaggerated and overemphasized.
By 1930 so much had been made of sunrises and sunsets that the sophisticated
were sick of them, as Evelyn Waugh reveals in his travel book Labels: </blockquote><br>
<br>
<blockquote> I do not think I shall ever forget the sight of Etna at sunset; the mountain
almost invisible in a blur of pastel grey, glowing on the top and then repeating
its shape, as though reflected, in a wisp of grey smoke, with the whole
horizon behind radiant with pink light, fading gently into a grey pastel sky.
Nothing I have ever seen in Art or Nature was quite so revolting.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-39">[39]</a>
But if Wilde and Waugh were tiring of sunrises and sunsets, most people
were not, and the general devotion to these effects lasted through the
Great War and well beyond. In July, 1931, the Southern Railway advertised
a dawn excursion this way: “Experience the novel thrill of watching
a summer dawn from the first streaks to the full sunrise!” As Robert
Graves and Alan Hodge report, “Forty people were expected; 1,400
showed up, and filled four trains.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-40">[40]</a></blockquote>
<b>(p.54)</b>
That is evidence that the influence of Ruskin leaked down abundantly
to those who had not read him. C. S. Lewis was a representative young
man of the period. Writing about his life at Oxford before entering the
army, he recalls that “the sky was, and still is, to me one of the principal
elements in any landscape, and long before I had seen [skies of all types]
named and sorted out in Modern Painters I was very attentive to [their]
different qualities ....”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">[41]</a> Max Plowman remembers, even if vaguely,
his Ruskin: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Was it Ruskin who said that the upper and more glorious half of Nature’s
pageant goes unseen by the majority of people? ... Well, the trenches have
altered that. Shutting off the landscape, they compel us to observe the sky;
and when it is a canopy of blue flecked with white clouds ... ‘ and when
the earth below is a shell-stricken waste, one looks up with delight, recalling
perhaps the days when, as a small boy, one lay on the garden lawn at home
counting the clouds as they passed.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">[42]</a> </blockquote><br>
<br>
Here one might object that sunsets are sunsets, in all times and places.
But no. It is impossible to think of anyone at any other time noticing a
sunset in such pedantic, painterly, high-minded, self-satisfied terms as
the young Basil Willey at Cambridge in 1916: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>There was a superb cirrus sunset tonight. Down low behind King’s Chapel
there was a perfect welter of flaming orange, seen in wonderful mosaic-fragments
through the high screen of elms in the Backs. Thronging the upper
heaven was a flight of winged shapes tinted with all hues of rose, salmon,
damask, and lavender.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">[43]</a> </blockquote><br>
<br>
Welter, thronging, a flight of winged shapes, tinted with all hues, rose, lavender:
superbly “of the period.” Before the war it was a commonplace that one
of the duties of “a writer” was to study such effects. Poverty-stricken
and shelterless on the Venice Lido in 1910, Frederick Rolfe (”Baron
Corvo”) spent whole nights walking on the beach. When the police questioned
him, he explained himself to their satisfaction by proclaiming that
he was a writer “studying the dawns.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">[44]</a> The Evelyn Waugh who says
of himself at fifteen, “I had not read much Ruskin, but I had in some
way imbibed most of his opinions,”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">[45]</a> reveals that for all his boredom
with the vulgar picturesque off Sicily he is squarely in the British tradition
of paying lots of attention to sky effects and knowing about their
thematic value for painting. On the first page· of his novel Officers and
Gentlemen (1955) we find this scene from a later war: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The [night) sky over London was glorious, ochre and madder, as though a
dozen tropical suns were simultaneously setting round the horizon; every-</blockquote>
<b>(p.55)</b>
<blockquote>where the searchlights clustered and hovered, then swept apart; here and
there pitchy clouds drifted and billowed; now and then a huge flash momentarily
froze the serene fireside glow. Everywhere the shells sparkled like
Christmas baubles. <br>
<br>	
“Pure Turner,” said Guy Crouchback enthusiastically .... <br>
<br>
“John Martin, surely?” said Ian Kilbannock ....</blockquote> <br>
<br>
S. S. Horsley, a soldier whose diary and pocket notebook are preserved
in the Imperial War Museum, is another legatee of Ruskin. In his diary
he very often takes the trouble to celebrate the sunrises at stand-to, and
when he wants to copy out a poem to treasure up for consolation in his
notebook, he chooses Yeats’s “He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,” a
poem entertaining no doubts that imagery drawn from the kinetic skies is ~
of very high value. <br>
<br>
Thus, by the time the war began, sunrise and sunset had become fully
freighted with implicit aesthetic and moral meaning. When a participant
in the war wants an ironic effect, a conventional way to achieve one is ·
simply to juxtapose a sunrise or sunset with the unlovely physical details .
of the war that man has made. This is the method of 2nd Lieutenant 
William Ratcliffe, destined to be killed on July 1, 1916. He writes his
parents in June: “Everywhere the work of God is spoiled by the hand of
man. One looks at a sunset and for a moment thinks that that at least is
unsophisticated, but an aeroplane flies across, and puff! puff! and the
whole scene is spoilt by clouds of shrapnel smoke.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">[46]</a> Details like “one
looks at a sunset” and “the whole scene” indicate the formal, painterly
dimensions of these Great War sunsets. They are almost in gilded
frames. The sad contrast between Man’s works and God’s is one of Blunden’s
perpetual ironic means in Undertones of War. One of his sunsets is
even more specifically theological (even if more sardonically so) than Lt.
Ratcliffe’s. Of the evening following a particularly ghastly battle near
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">Ypres</a> in 1917 he writes: “The eastern sky that evening was all too
brilliant with British rockets, appealing for artillery assistance. Westward,
over blue hills, the sunset was all seraphim and cherubim.’’<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">[47]</a><br>
<br>
Emphasized as objects of close attention by the daily rituals of stand to,
sanctified as morally meaningful by the long tradition of Ruskin,
these sunrises and sunsets, already a staple of prewar Georgian poetry
and the literature of the Celtic “Twilight,” move to the very center of
English poetry of the Great War. They are its constant atmosphere and
its special symbolic method. The most sophisticated poem of the war,
Isaac Rosenberg’s “Break of Day in the Trenches,” undertakes its quiet
meditative ironies at morning stand-to. The most “representative”- I
<b>(p.56)</b>
suppose I mean the most frequently anthologized-is Wilfred Owen’s
“Anthem for Doomed Youth,” which darkens to this “period” dying fall: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.</blockquote>
(Bernard Bergonzi’s “Study of the Literature of the Great War” is titled
perhaps even more suggestively than its author realizes: Heroes’ Twilight.)
The most popular poem for quotation, still, at memorial occasions (at the
Cenotaph, for example) is Laurence Binyon’s “For the Fallen,” written
with uncanny prescience of the appropriate imagery in September, 1914,
when the war was a mere seven weeks along. Its memorable stanza
begins, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:<br>
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>
And the stanza concludes with lines which many parents and wives<br>
chose as supremely appropriate for their soldiers’ headstones: </blockquote><br>
<br>
At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>
We will remember them.<br>
Equally popular for headstones were such conventional evocations of a<br>
morally significant sunrise as<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Till morning breaks</blockquote>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Until the day breaks and the shadows flee.</blockquote>
<br>
And sunrise and sunset did not have to wait for solemn occasions to
enter poems. They appeared everywhere, even in whimsical verse of the
sort printed by the Army Service Corps’ Hangar Herald in the days when
officers were still wearing their “pips” on their tunic cuffs: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Oh, deem it pride, not lack’ of skill,<br>
That thus forbids my sleeve’s increase:<br>
The morning and the evening still<br>
Have but one star apiece.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">[48]</a></blockquote><br>

In working up scenes for <i>The Memoirs of George Sherston</i> between 1916
and 1936, Sassoon recovered the Great War feeling for symbolic sunsets
and adjusted important emotional climaxes to make them take place at
such rich but melancholy moments. For example, after enlisting Sherston
says his ritual goodbye to his Kentish drawing room at sunset: 
<b>(p.57)</b>
<blockquote>The sun blinds . . . were drawn down the tall windows; I was alone in the
twilight room, with the glowering red of sunset peering through the chinks
and casting the shadows of leaves on a fiery patch of light which rested on
the wall by the photograph of [George Frederic Watts’s painting] “Love and
Death.” So I looked my last and rode away to war on my bicycle. . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">[49]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
It is in twilight that George Sherston first beholds his new ideal friend,
his young fellow officer Dick Tiltwood: “Twilight was falling and there
was only one small window [in the army hut], but even in the half-light
his face surprised me by its candor and freshness. He had the obvious
good looks which go with fair hair and firm features, but it was the radiant
integrity of his expression which astonished me.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">[50]</a> Dick’s burial in
“a sack” a few months later occurs when “the sky was angry with a red
smoky sunset.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">[51]</a> Sunset is likewise. the time for making crucial decisions,
like Sherston’s to return to the war after the months of safety his
pacifistic mutiny has earned him. Snug in Craiglockhart Hospital, he
says, “I argued it out with myself in the twilight.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">[52]</a> The very talisman
which Sassoon carried in his pocket at the front was a lump of fire opal
which he used to call his “pocket sunset.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">[53]</a><br>
<br>
This exploitation of moments of waxing or waning half-light is one of
the distinct hallmarks of Great War rhetoric. It signals a constant reaching out
towards traditional significance, very much like the system of
“high” diction which dominated the early stages of the war. It reveals an–
attempt to make some sense of the war in relation to inherited tradition.
We can see this clearly by contrasting some of the memorable poems of
the Second War, when there were few static stand-to’s - it is hard to stand-to 
at 10,000 feet-and when dawn and dusk had become largely de-ritualized,
no longer automatically portentous. Where are dawn and dusk in 
Randall Jarrell’s “Eighth Air Force,” or “Losses,” or “The Death
of the Ball Turret Gunner”? Or in Henry Reed’s “Lessons of the War”?
Or in Keith Douglas’s “Vergissmeinnicht”? In Gavin Ewart’s compelling
“When a Beau Goes In,” typical of Second War poetry in its laconic refusal
to reach out for any myth, the time of day is as irrelevant as praying–<br>
<br>
<blockquote>When a Beau goes in,<br>
Into the drink,<br>
It makes you think,<br>
Because, you see, they always sink<br>
But nobody says “Poor lad”<br>
Or goes about looking sad<br>
Because, you see, it’s war,<br>
It’s the unalterable law.</blockquote>

<b>(p.58)</b>
<blockquote>Although it’s perfectly certain<br>
The pilot’s gone for a Burton<br>
And the observer too<br>
It’s nothing to do with you<br>
And if they both should go<br>
To a land where falls no rain nor hail nor driven snow<br>
Here, there, or anywhere,<br>
Do you suppose they care? <br>
<br>
You shouldn’t cry<br>
Or say a prayer or sigh.<br>
In the cold sea, in the dark<br>
It isn’t a lark<br>
But it isn’t Original Sin<br>
It’s just a Beau going in.</blockquote><br>
<br>
Ewart’s flagrantly un-innocent just exemplifies what Larkin means to
point to by saying, “Never such innocence again.” just asserts the utter
irrelevance of theological or any other connotations. The tone is like that
of the opening of Jarrell’s “Losses”:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>It was not dying: everybody died. </blockquote><br>
<br>
In a world where myth is of no avail and where traditional significance
has long ago been given up for lost, time of day doesn’t matter. <br>
<br>
Indeed, in Second War poetry there is something like a refusal to notice
that sunrise and sunset ever were mythicized. An example is Louis
Simpson’s long poem “The Runner,” whose more than 800 lines narrate
a series of infantry actions occurring over several weeks. Not once is
there a significant description of a sunrise or sunset. When the poem
requites an indication of these times of day, Simpson performs the description,
or rather the announcement, in the most abstract, inert way:
“Day turned to dusk,” he will write, or<br>
<br><blockquote>
Day seemed less to rise<br>
Than darkness to withdraw. </blockquote><br>
<br>
What he has done is to pare away traditional connotation. We are well
past the moment when we can turn for comfort to the implications of the
day breaking and the shadows fleeing. It is perhaps less that we have
“lost hope” than that we have lost literary resources. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, traditional ritual meaning is what the poems of the
Great War are at pains to awaken. Especially the earliest poems of the
war, thoroughly resolute when not enthusiastic, conceive of dawn as<br>
<br>
<b>(p.59)</b>
morally meaningful, as a moment fit for great beginnings. Hardy’s
famous early call to action, “Men Who March Away” (published in the
Times, September 9, 1914), chooses earliest morning as the significant
time for volunteers contrasted with “daltiers”-to step out, animated by their 
“faith and fire”:<br>
<br><blockquote>
What of the faith and fire within us<br>
Men who march away<br>
Ere the barncocks say<br>
Night is growing gray,<br>
Leaving all that here can win us;<br>
What of the faith and fire within us<br>
Men who march away? </blockquote><br>
<br>
It was Hardy’s pre-dawn moment that lodged Edward Thomas’s
memory. When he wrote W. H. Hudson to praise Hardy’s-poem, the
cocks waiting for the incipient dawn are what he finds memorable: “I
thought Hardy’s poem in The Times ‘Ere the barn-cocks say/Night is
growing gray,’ the only good one concerned with the war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">[54]</a> When
Thomas writes his own call to action, he remembers Hardy’s dawn.
Thomas’s “The Trumpet” inverts the terms of the standard aubade in
order to encourage enlistment. Dawn is conceived as a signal to action
rather than as the last hurried moment for dalliance: <br>
<br><blockquote>
. . . Rise up and scatter<br>
The dew that covers<br>
The print of last night’s lovers Scatter<br>
it, scatter it! <br>
<br>
Open your eyes to the air<br>
That has washed the eyes o( the stars<br>
Through all the dewy night:<br>
Up with the light,<br>
To the old wars;<br>
Arise, arise! </blockquote><br>
<br>
One who might have heard Thomas’s summons is the clerk of Herbert
Asquith’s “The Volunteer,” who, toiling away in the City, has feared that<br>
<br><blockquote>
his days would drift away<br>
With no lance broken in life’s tournament. </blockquote><br>
<br>
He enlisted and was killed, and<br>
<br>
<blockquote>. . . now those waiting dreams are satisfied. </blockquote><br>
<br>
<b>(p.60)</b>
From a boring office to the “field” he went; or as Asquith puts it,
amalgamating Tennyson with the practical convention of the attack at
dawn: <br>
<br><blockquote>
From twilight to the halls of dawn he went. </blockquote><br>
<br>
Now, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>His lance is broken; but he lies content
With that high hour, in which he lived and died. </blockquote><br>
<br>
It is “that high hour,” dawn, that has made the difference. <br>
<br>
It also makes the difference in two of Rupert Brooke’s five famous innocent
sonnets of 1914. Brooke perhaps did not know yet that attacks do
actually take place at dawn; he certainly could not have known that
stand-’to would become a trench rite transforming the Georgian literary
symbolism of vague high hopes into a daily routine of quiet terror. But
there is something like prescience in Brooke’s sensing that dawn is the
right figure for the beginning of the major action which is the war: God’s
very hour-the irony to be sure is almost unbearable for us-is “dawn”:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Now God be thanked who has matched us with His Hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping.
(Sonnet I: “Peace”)</blockquote><br>
<br>
Dawn also visits Brooke’s Fourth Sonnet, “The Dead,” where, together
with sunset, it is one of the specific “kindnesses” vouchsafed the young
before their death: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Dawn was theirs,<br>
And sunset, and the colors of the earth. </blockquote><br>
<br>
If the dead are now fixed in frost, at least the delights of “waking” once
were theirs. Golden half-light was Brooke’s world, and had been ever
since “The Old Vicarage: Grantchester” of 1912, a poem whose 140 lines
manage to encompass four separate dawns and three sunsets. No wonder
Wilfrid Gibson, lamenting Brooke’s death in 1915, recalled him as an
emanation of a “sunset glow”:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>He’s gone.<br>
I do not understand.<br>
I only know<br>
That, as he turned to go<br>
And waved his hand,<br>
In his young eyes a sudden glory shone,<br>
And I was dazzled by a sunset glow,<br>
And he was gone. </blockquote><br>
<br>
<b>(p.61)</b>
The process by which, as the war went on, these Georgian metaphoric
sunrises and sunsets turned literal and hastly can be observed in “Before
Action,” a poem written by William Noel Hodgson two days before
he was killed in the Somme attack. Writing as during the last sunset
before the next day’s attack, he begins his three-part prayer with a Ruskinian
survey of benefits received: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>By all the glories of the day<br>
And the co-ol evening’s benison,<br>
By that last sunset touch that lay<br>
Upon the hills when day was done,<br>
By beauty lavishly outpoured<br>
And blessings carelessly. received,<br>
By all the days that I have lived<br>
Make me a soldier, Lord. </blockquote><br>
<br>
We are still in the purlieus of the Georgian understanding of “Beauty.”
But as he writes Hodgson knows that the forthcoming attack will take
place in the early morning, and the final stanza, while maintaining its
focus on traditionally significant times of day, signals an awareness of the
actual situation a day hence. The “familiar hill” is both metaphoric and
literal, or rather it is a metaphor caught in the act of turning literal: the
hill is at once the lucky eminence of youth and the actual observation
post where the speaker has watched with too little feeling “a hundred”
sunsets preceding morning attacks like the one in which he’ will now take
part: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>I, that on my familiar hill<br>
Saw with uncomprehending eyes<br>
A hundred of Thy sunsets spill<br>
Their fresh and sanguine sacrifice,<br>
Ere the sun swings his noonday sword<br>
Must say goodbye to all of this:<br>
By all delights that I shall miss,<br>
Help me to die, O Lord. </blockquote><br>
<br>
<i>Spill, fresh, sanguine:</i> with those terms the two dimensions of the poem
merge into one. Georgian figure and discovered actuality merge; the red
of sunset is seen as identical with the red of freshly shed blood. With <i>sacrifice,</i>
the poem, although still maintaining its pose of abstract literariness,
turns to face. actual facts, and we realize that it is no longer
talking about sky effects and Literature but about people and action.
Without rudeness or abruptness, Ruskin has been invited to squat in a
jump-off trench on a hill near <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>. <br>
<br>
<b>(p.62)</b>
A similar deployment of traditional literary terms in aid of the new actuality
occurs in Wilfred Owen’ “Exposure.” After a night of trench
watch in icy win an ram, those standing-to and peering to the east
perceive the half-light of dawn breaking, gray as in pastoral literary
tradition, but gray now also like the shade of the German uniform: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow . . .<br>
We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy.<br>
Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army<br>
Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,<br>
But nothing happens.</blockquote>
<br>The new alliance of the terms of “poetry” with those of experience is apparent
likewise in Blunden’s ‘Trench Raid Near Hooge.” A ten-man
raiding party goes out<br>
<br>
<blockquote>At an hour before the rosy-fingered<br>
Morning should come, </blockquote><br>
<br>
and is caught by a prepared artillery fix. The sudden flashes of the guns
over the horizon are like “false dawns” usurping the prerogatives of the ·
real one, while the fiery tracer trails of the projectiles constitute a new
kind of rosy fingers, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>All at one aim<br>
Protending and bending. . . . </blockquote><br>
<br>
When the real dawn arrives, she is shocked-indeed, shell-shocked-by
what, fingers trembling now, she beholds at the point of impact: <br>
<br><blockquote>Nor rosy dawn at last appearing<br>
Through the icy shade<br>
Might mark without trembling the new-deforming<br>
Of earth that had seemed past further storming.<br>
Her fingers played<br>
<br>
One thought, with something of human pity<br>
On six or seven<br>
Whose looks were hard to understand,<br>
But that they ceased to care what hand<br>
Lit earth and heaven. </blockquote><br>
<br>
Another complicated dawn in Blunden is the one marking the direction
of the attack in “Come On, My Lucky Lads.” The poem begins
with an apostrophe to dawn couched in the highest terms of traditional
ode: <br>
<br>
<b>(p.63)</b>
<blockquote>O rosy red, O torrent splendor<br>
Staining all the orient gloom,<br>
O celestial work of wonder-<br>
A million mornings in one bloom! </blockquote><br>
<br>
“The artist of creation” is busy, as in Ruskin, about his twice-daily job
of work. But as the attack moves out, the speaker finds such rhetoric impossible
to sustain. The red dawn now modulates to a “blood burst,” and
before the poem is over we are forced to gaze at a less inspiring red: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The dawn that hangs behind the goal,<br>
What is that artist’s joy to me?<br>
Here limps poor Jock with a gash in the poll,<br>
His red blood now is the red I see, </blockquote><br>
<br>
-and suddenly, “literature” forgotten, the poem explodes in a line, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The swooning white of him, and that red! </blockquote><br>
<br>
whose twisted meter and vernacular idiom measure the inadequacy of
language like “orient gloom” to register what’s going on. <br>
<br>
Dawn has never recovered from what the Great War did to it. Writing
four years after the Armistice, Elliot accumulates the new, modern associations
of dawn: cold, the death multitudes, insensate marching in
files, battle, and corpses too shallowly interred: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br>
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br>
I had not thought death had undone so many.<br>
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br>
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. .<br>
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!<br>
You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!<br>
That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br>
Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br>
Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? ... “</blockquote><br>
<br>
When he was touring the Somme battlefields in 1920, observing them in
all lights, Stephen Graham found that full light did not properly illuminate
them. “Sunlight and noonday,” he says, “do not always show us
truth.” They suggest too insistently things like vitality and ecstasy and
the soaring consciousness of complete “life. “Only in the grey light of afternoon
and evening, and looking with the empty eye-socket of night darkness
can one easily apprehend what is spread out here-the last
landscape of tens of thousands who lie dead.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-55">[55]</a>
<b>(p.64)</b>
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> A RIDICULOUS PROXIMITY</i></b></center><br>
<br>
In the Second World War the common experience of soldiers was dire
long-term exile at an unbridgeable distance from “home.” One fought as
far from home as Alsace is from California, or Guadalcanal from Manhattan,
or Bengasi from Birmingham and Berlin. “Shipping out” is significantly
a phrase belong to the Second War, not the First. And once
committed to the war, one stayed away until it should be over. <br>
<br>
By contrast, what makes experience in the Great War unique and
gives It a special freight of irony is the ridiculous proximity of the
trenches to home. Just seventy miles from “this stinking world of sticky
trickling earth” was the rich plush of London theater seats and the perfume,
alcohol, and cigar smoke of the Cafe Royal. The avenue to these
things was familiar and easy: on their two-week leaves from the front,
the officers rode the same Channel boats they had known in peacetime,
and the presence of the same porters and stewards (”Nice to serve you
again, Sir”) provided a ghastly presence of normality. One officer on
leave, observed by Arnold Bennett late in 1917, “had breakfasted in the
trenches and dined in his club in London.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-56">[56]</a><br>
<br>
The absurdity of it all became an obsession. One soldier spoke for everyone
when he wrote home, “England is so absurdly near.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-57">[57]</a> Another,
bogged down in the Salient in September, 1917, devoted many passages
of his diary to considering the anomaly: “I often think how strange it is
that quiet home life is going on at Weybridge, and everywhere else in
England, all the time that these terrific things are happening here.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-58">[58]</a><br>
<br>
Remembering the war fifty years afterwards and shaping his recollections
into a novel, one participant discovers that the thing he finds-especially
“hard to believe” about the war is this farcical proximity. On the
way back up the line on a train, one officer returning from leave remarks
to others in his compartment: “Christ! ... I was at <i>Chu Chin Chow</i> last
night with my wife. Hard to believe, isn’t it?” And the narrator observes:
<br><blockquote>Hard to believe. Impossible to believe. That other life, so near in time
and distance, was something led by different men. Two lives that bore no
relation to each other. That was what they all felt, the bloody lot of them.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-59">[59]</a>
</blockquote><br>
And on a similar visit to the past, but this time a literal one, other observers
are struck by the same “disquieting” anomaly. Visiting the battlefields
forty-six years after the war, John Brophy finds it “fantastic”·
that so battered an area can have been restored to cultivation even after
nearly half a century. This gross contrast reminds him of an even more
striking one, and he goes on: “What is most disquieting on such a visit is
<b>(p.65)</b>
to realize how little space . . separated the line, the soldier’s troglodyte
world, the world which might have been another planet, from home,
from England, from sanity.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-60">[60]</a><br>
<br>
There were constant reminders of just how close England was. Some
were sweetly well-intentioned, like Their Majesties’ Christmas Card,
distributed to all hands in 1914. On the same occasion Princess Mary’s
gifts of pipes and tobacco were much appreciated, as were the Christmas
puddings sent across by the Daily Mirror (as the war proceeded, known
increasingly to the troops as the Daily Prevaricator). At even the worst
moments, when apparently nothing could live through the shelling,
troops found the Daily Mail being peddled by French newsboys at the
entrances to communication trenches, and buying it was a way, if not of
finding out what was going on, at least of “feeling at home” and achieving
a laugh as well. There were other anomalous apparitions of “London.”
During the winter of 1914-15 a familiar sight just behind the line
was ·a plethora of London heavy transport vehicles-brewer’s trucks,
moving vans, London buses- often with their original signs intact. “You
meet them,” says one observer, “toiling along the greasy road with heavy
loads of shells or food, their gay advertisements of Bass’s Beer or Crosse
and Blackwell scarred and dirtied by the war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-61">[61]</a> Some traditional civilian
comforts might find themselves in odd circumstances. Major Frank
Isherwood relied on Mothersill’s seasickness preventative to mitigate the
Channel crossings,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-62">[62]</a> and General J. L. Jack sniffed often at “a smelling
salts bottle given years ago by an old aunt without any thought of this
purpose” to disguise “the stench from the older corpses in our parapets.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-63">[63]</a> 
Sassoon, perceiving that uncut wire was going to be one of the
problems on July 1, 1916, devoted his last leave just before the Somme
jump-off to shopping. At the Army and Navy Stores he bought two pair
of wire-cutters with rubber-covered handles, which he issued to his company
on his return .. These were, he says, “my private contribution to the
Great Offensive.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-64">[64]</a><br>
<br>
The postal connection between home and the trenches was so rapid
and efficient that it constituted a further satire on the misery of the
troops in their ironic close exile. Writing on July 18, 1916, during some
of the worst moments on the Somme,. one officer says: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>It is extraordinary how the post manages to reach one out here. The other
day we were moving about all day, over trenches and back again, and when
we had been sitting still about an hour, the post came in. We got the London
papers only a day late, as we always do.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-65">[65]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
Letters and parcels normally took about four days, sometimes only two.~
Exotic foodstuffs could easily be sent across, not just standard non-
<b>(p.65)</b>
perishables like tinned kippers and oysters, tinned butter and fowl, pate
and chocolate, cheese and cherry brandy and wine (by the dozen bottles
at once), but perishables like gingerbread, cakes, and tarts; fresh fruit
and butter and eggs; and fresh flowers (primroses, violets) for the
“table.” Sometimes one took postal pot-luck. In hospital, Captain
M. J. H. Drummond received a gift of eggs, on each of which was written
“Wishing you good luck from Violet Palmer, Girls Council School,
Thetford.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-66">[66]</a> And only occasionally did things arrive spoilt, as once for
Corporal J. L. Morgan, who sent “Annie and Art” this little report of a
minor hope abridged: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>I ... received your parcel quite safe. . . . I am sorry to say though the tart
had gone bad. I was so mad as I just felt like a bit of tart then too. I think
the tin box done it. I don’t think a tin box is as good as a cardboard box or
wood box for something in the tart line.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-67">[67]</a></blockquote>–<br>
<br>

A different kind of spoilage is what worried F. E. Smith, who had boxes
of very good cigars sent from home. To prevent their being pillaged en
route, he instructed his wife to<br>
<br>
<blockquote>tell the Stores not to print any indication that the boxes are cigars. Have
printed yourself some gummed labels as follows: </blockquote><br>
<br>
<blockquote>ARMY TEMPERANCE SOCIETY

Both Fortnum and Mason’s and Harrod’s specialized in gift assortments
for the front, Fortnum’s fruit cake being especially popular for
lasting well. The wits of the Wipers Times thought it funny that these
normalities-redolent of the well-to-do sending off hampers of treats to
boys at the better public schools-should persist as if nothing had
changed. They printed frequent satiric advertisements in which
“Herod’s, Universal Provider” and “Messrs. Shortone and Pastum” announced
their Christmas boxes and described such desirable novelties as
“Our Latest Improved Pattern Combination Umbrella and Wire Cutter.”
Sometimes excesses crept in. Brigadier F. P. Crozier recalls one officer
who in 1916 “kept a sort of open mess for which he paid, but which was
more like a society lunch than a serious effort to establish war hardness
and endurance. Chickens, hams, jellies, wines and various rich and unwholesome
foods were posted to this soldier daily by a devoted wife, or
consigned from fashionable stores. It was not war.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-69">[69]</a><br>
<br>
The postal service brought the troops their usual magazines: one simply
–
<b>(p.67)</b>
indicated a change of address and the subscription continued uninterrupted. 
The standard officers’ dugout required, as an index of swank,
current copies of the Bystander, the Tatter, and Punch, and as testimony to
upper-class interests in the pastoral and in connoisseurship, Country Life
and the Burlington. Major P. H. Pilditch received his copy of The Wykehamist
regularly. Geoffrey Keynes specialized in receiving antiquarian
booksellers’ catalogs and buying books by return mail. He wrote in 1 968:
“I still have a copy of Sir Thomas Browne’s Pseudodoxia Epidemica, 1669,
containing the note: ‘Sent off from Edgehill, Dernancourt, near <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>,
21 March 1918, the day of the great German offensive. It passed through
Albert on 22 March, the last day on which the post could be sent that
way.’”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-70">[70]</a> The smallest memorials of a familiar beauty could sustain the
spirits. Committed to the Somme, Max Plowman receives a packet of
small reproductions of Renaissance paintings-Rubens, Botticelli-and
observes: “My dear in England has sent me half a dozen small Medici
prints, and I cannot describe the joy they are to me in this stricken
waste.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-71">[71]</a> The most appropriate comment would seem to be the line
from Frost’s “Directive” about children’s playthings: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Weep for what little things could make them glad. </blockquote>–<br>
<br>
We hear of gramophones and boxing gloves sent by mail, of fly-sprayers
and “metal waistcoats,” of Zeiss field-glasses and wading boots and the
popular Harrison’s Anti-Lice Pomade. One man wanted engraved visiting
cards (”Oh reason not the need”), and V. de S. Pinto asked his father
to ·send “an indelible pencil, candles, and the works of Petronius in the
Loeb edition.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-72">[72]</a> Twice a year regularly one artillery officer received a
pair of Abbott’s Phiteezi Boots from a London shop.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-73">[73]</a> Once when
Wilfred Owen inadvertently left two towels at home on leave, he simply
had them posted back to him in his trench.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-74">[74]</a> The efficiency of the postal
arrangements meant that there was parcel traffic in both directions and
that souvenirs could be dispatched readily, so readily, in fact, that one
had to be careful to eschew the obvious. “Best love,” Oliver Lyttelton
writes his mother: “I am sending you a German forage cap which is a
little more interesting, I think, than the hackneyed helmet.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-75">[75]</a><br>
<br>
In the trenches one was absurdly near not just to England but to normal
social usages. Discoursing on the effectiveness of overhead German
harassing machine-gun fire, General Sir Richard Gale notes that one
bullet came down out of nowhere and hit his orderly: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>I got him into my shelter and could see no mark, but when he turned round
I could see the back of his tunic was dripping with blood. The bullet had
gone right through him .... The bullet passed very near his lung; he was
lucky not to have been killed.</blockquote>
<b>(p.68)</b>
But thanks to the social norms and the postal service, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>After he got home he sent me a lovely cake, which kind thought I appreciated
very much.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-76">[76]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>	
If the troops were constantly reminded by transmissions like these
how ironically close England was, those at home were kept equally
mindful of how near the trenches were. And not just by assertions to
that effect by editors and politicians. They could literally hear the war,
at least if they lived· in Surrey, Sussex, or Kent, where the artillery was
not only audible but, with the wind in the right direction, quite plainly
audible. When the mines went off at Messines, not merely was the blast
heard in Kent: the light flashes were visible too. The guns were heard
especially during preparation for a major assault, when they would fire
unremittingly for a week or ten days, day and night. Thus Edmund
Blunden recalls that in late June, 1916, as the artillery strove to cut the
German wire for the Somme attack, “in Southdown villages the schoolchildren
sat wondering at that incessant drumming and rattling of the
windows.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-77">[77]</a> The preparation at Passchendaele was “distinctly” audible
to Kipling at Burwash, Sussex, 100 miles from the guns.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-78">[78]</a><br>
<br>
One reason modern English poetry can be said to begin with Hardy is
that he is the first to invite into poems the sound of ominous gunfire
heard across the water: There is not just “Channel Firing”; there is “The
Discovery,” written well before the war and published in Satires of Circumstance
in November, 1914. The speaker remembers a love affair
which occurred in an unlikely coastal setting sinister with a mysterious
menace: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>I wandered to a crude coast<br>
Like a ghost;<br>
Upon the hills I saw fires – <br>
Funeral pyres<br>
Seemingly-and heard breaking<br>
Waves. . .</blockquote><br>
<br>
-waves which break like<br>
<br>
<blockquote>distant cannonades that set the land shaking. </blockquote><br>
<br>
So sinister and unpromising was the setting, so utterly brutal and “modern,”
that he could never have guessed that there he would find<br>
<br>
<blockquote>A Love-nest,<br>
Bowered and candle-lit.</blockquote>
<b>(p.69)</b>
The poem is a condensed redaction of Arnold’s “Dover Beach,” but with
certain adjustments in the idea of the modern since Arnold’s day. Arnold’s
ignorant armies are guessed at but unheard. Those implicit even
in Hardy’s simile are palpable, audible. They are fully imaginable, as
they are in this passage too, where two people are walking on a beach
very like that at Dover: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The boots of the two . . . crunch through to sand or shingle. The very bottom
of the year. They can hear the guns in Flanders today, all the way
across the Channel on the wind. </blockquote><br>
<br>
We recognize it as distinctly in the tradition. Yet it was written not in
1914 nor as a recollection in 1929, but in 1973. The war is not the First
but the Second; and the two who walk on the beach and listen there to
the guns of Flanders are Ned Pointsman and Tyrone Slothrop, of the
Special Operations Executive and of Thomas Pynchon’s brilliant Gravity’s
Rainbow,<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-79">[79]</a> in whose pages persists the Great War theme - already
mastered by Hardy even before the war broke out - of the ironic proximity 
of violence and disaster to safety, to meaning, and to love. <br>
<br>
<center><b><i> THE BONEYARD</i></b></center><br>
<br>
Writing his sister in August, 1916, one soldier marvels at the fantastic
holes and ditches which scar the whole landscape and wonders, “How
ever they will get it smoothed out again is more than I can imagine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-80">[80]</a>
The work of smoothing it out continues to this day. At first, some
thought restoration of the area impossible and advised that it simply be
abandoned. In 1919 the battlefields were still much as 1918 had left
them, but a tourist could visit them, assisted by a series of <i>Illustrated
Michelin Guides to the Battlefields (1914-1918)</i>, written in English and
printed in England. Gradually the road network was re-established;
craters and trenches were filled in; duds were collected and exploded;
nasty things were collected and buried; and villagers began returning and
rebuilding, often exactly reproducing a leveled town on its original site. <br>
<br>
Today the Somme is a peaceful but sullen place, unforgeting and unforgiving.
The people, who work largely at raising vegetables and grains,
are “correct” but not friendly. To wander now over the fields destined to
extrude their rusty metal fragments for centuries is to appreciate in the
most intimate way the permanent reverberations of July, 1916. When the
air is damp you can smell rusted iron everywhere, even though you see
only wheat and barley. The farmers work the fields without joy. They
<b>(p.70)</b>
collect the duds, shell-casings, fuses, and shards of old barbed wire as
the plow unearths them and stack them in the corners of their fields.
Some of the old barbed wire, both British and German, is used for fencing.
Many of the shell craters are still there, though smoothed out and
as they were. When the sun is low in the afternoon, on the gradual
slopes of the low hills you see the traces of the zig-zag of trenches. Many
farmhouses have out in back one of the little British wooden huts that
used to house soldiers well behind the lines; they make handy toolsheds.
Lurking in every spot of undergrowth just off the beaten track are eloquent
little things: rusted buckles, rounds of corroded small-arms ammunition,
metal tabs from ammunition boxes, bits of Bully tin, buttons. <br>
<br>
<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a> today is one of the saddest places in France. It has all been restored
to its original ugliness. The red-brick Basilica is as it was before
the war, with the gilded virgin back up on top of the tower, quite erect.
But despite an appearance of adequacy, everything human in <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">Albert</a>
seems to have been permanently defeated. The inhabitants are dour. Everywhere
there is an air of bitterness about being passed over by the
modernity, sophistication, and affluence of modern France. Everywhere
one senses a quiet fury at being condemned to live in this boneyard and
backwater, where even the crops contend with soil once ruined by gas. <br>
<br>
And a boneyard it is. Every week bones come to light. Depending on
one’s mood one either quietly buries them again, or flings them into the
nearby brush, or saves them to turn over to the employees of the Commonwealth
(formerly “Imperial”) War Graves Commission, which supervises
the 2,500 British military cemeteries from offices in the main cities.
The cemeteries are both pretty and bizarre, fertile with roses, projecting
an almost unendurably ironic peacefulness. They memorialize not just
the men buried in them, but the talents for weighty public rhetoric of
Rudyard Kipling. He was called on to devise almost all the verbal formulas
employed by the Imperial War Graves Commission, from “Their
Name Liveth For Evermore,” carved on the large “Stone of Remembrance”
in each cemetery, to the words incised on headstones over the
bodies of the unidentified: “A Soldier of the Great War/Known unto
God.” The unforgettable, infinitely pathetic inscriptions are not Kipling’s
but those which the families of the dead were allowed-after long
debate within the Commission about “uniformity”-to place on their
stones. In addition to the still hopeful ones about dawn and fleeing
shadows we find some which are more “modern,” that is, more personal,
particular, and hopeless:
<b>(p.71)</b>
<br>
<br><blockquote>Our dear Ted. He died for us. <br>
<br>
Our Dick. <br>
<br>
If love could have saved him he would not have died. </blockquote><br>
<br>
And some read as if refusing to play the game of memorial language at
all: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>A sorrow too deep for words. </blockquote><br>
<br>
The notorious Buttle of Warlencourt, a fifty-foot knoll on the road to
Bapaume from which the Germans strenuously held the British advance
in the autumn and winter of 1916, is overgrown and silent. Crops grow
right to its foot, dipping here and there to betray the persistent shapes of
shell holes and mine craters. Tens of thousands of men simply disappeared
here. The sticky Somme mud makes large unwieldy spheres of
your shoes as you climb to the top through the thick undergrowth. At
the top you can picnic, if you have the heart for it, and inspect the large
weathered wooden cross erected by the Germans at the summit and apparently
renewed at the end of the Second World War. On it is carved
the word <i>Friede</i>. 
<br>
<br>
<center><b><i> WILL IT EVER END?</i></b></center><br>
<br>
But the likelihood that peace would ever come again was often in serious
doubt during the war. One did not have to be a lunatic or a particularly
despondent visionary to conceive quite seriously that the war would literally
never end and would become the permanent condition of mankind.
The stalemate and the attrition would go on infinitely, becoming,
like the telephone and the internal combustion engine, a part of the accepted
atmosphere of the modern experience. Why indeed not, given the
palpable irrationality of the new world? Why not, given the vociferous
contempt with which peace plans were received by the patriotic majorities
on both sides? <br>
<br>
The possibility that the war might be endless began to tease the mind
near the end of 1916. In November, Queen Mary hinted in a letter to
Lady Mount Stephen that even her expectation of an expeditious and rational
conclusion was beginning to weaken: “The length of this horrible
war is most depressing. I really think it gets worse the longer it lasts.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-81">[81]</a>
In its “Review of the Year [1916],” published on New Year’s Day, 1917,
the Times, whose optimism usually made it sound like merely a government
<b>(p.71)</b>
gazette, had to admit that “the year closes, as its two predecessors
closed, in blood and destruction; and after 29 months of fighting, which
has involved nearly all the States of Europe, anything like a definite
decision seems far distant.” <br>
<br>
At the front, as might be expected, views were considerably darker. It
was there, in dugouts and funk-holes, that the bulk of what were called
the Neverendians could be found. R. H. Mottram remembers one pessimistic
officer who, in the summer of 1917, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>roughed out the area between the “front” of that date and the Rhine, . . . .
and divided this by the area gained, on the average, at the Somme, V1my
and Messines. The result he multiplied by the time taken to prepare and
fight those offensives, averaged again. The result he got was that, allowing
for no setbacks, and providing the pace could be maintained, we should arrive
at, the Rhine in one hundred and eighty years.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-82">[82]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
The always intelligent-and here brilliantly prophetic-Major Pilditch
came to a similar conclusion with less suggestion of frivolity. Observing
events on the Somme in August, 1917, he notes: “Both sides are too
strong for a finish yet. God knows how long it will be at this rate. None
of us will ever see its end and children still at school will have to take 1t
over.” The French and Germans on the spot thought so too. After a dinner
party one night with some French officer colleagues, at which everyone
“talked a bit on . . . the never failing topic, ‘Quand sera-ce fini?’ “
Pilditch found that his companions “seemed to think the war might go
on forever.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-83">[83]</a> German prisoners interviewed by Philip Gibbs after the
Somme battles agreed: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>”How will it end?” I asked [a German doctor].
“I see no end to it,” he answered. “It is. the suicide of nations.
I met other prisoners then and a year afterward who could see no end of
the massacre.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-84">[84]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
One way of dealing with the intolerable suspicion that the war would
last forever was to make it tolerable by satire. Some chose to link the apparent
infiniteness of the war with the rigidities of Haig’s character.
After visiting the front in 1916 George Bernard Shaw wrote of Haig:
“He was, I should say, a man of chivalrous and scrupulous character. He
made me feel that the war would last thirty years, ·and that he would
carry it on irreproachably until he was superannuated.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-85">[85]</a> Simpler kinds
of humor were a help, too. A well-known Bruce Bairnsfather cartoon
depicted this front-line conversation about lengths of enlistment: 
<b>(p.73)</b>
<blockquote>” ‘Ow long are you up for, Bill?”<br>
“Seven years.”<br>
“Yer lucky-I’m duration.” </blockquote><br>
<br>
This sort of fiction could always be equaled in “real life.” The middle aged
batman Private Hale reports that one Porter, a colleague, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>always went about with a bent head and with a constant air of acute depression.
In fact it was quite in the nature of things that he should come up to
me one morning [in 1917] ... and in his usual slow depressed voice remark
to me that it was a “life-sentence.” I asked him what was a life-sentence? He
replied, “the War.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-86">[86]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
Some humorists imagined the distant future with the war still proceeding.
A poem in the Wipers Times for September 8, 1917, presents
Tommy aged and sere some years hence, and still in the line: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>The Summer had been long and cold,<br>
And Intha Pink was growing old;<br>
He stroked his hoary snow-white beard,<br>
And gazed with eyes now long since bleared. </blockquote><br>
<br>
One Divisional entertainment featured a sketch titled “The Trenches,
1950,” in which “A fed-up Tommy confronts an equally fed-up ...
Hun across a ‘No Man’s Land’ shrunk in width to a couple of yards or
so. All hopes of ‘relief’ have long since vanished.” Reporting this, Major
Pilditch says: “I laughed more than I have for years.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-87">[87]</a><br>
<br>
All three of the great English memoirists of the war, Graves, Blunden, )
and Sassoon, confess to entertaining the idea or the image of the wars
literally continuing forever. Graves recalls with accustomed jauntiness:
“We held two irreconcilable beliefs: that the war would never end and
that we would win it.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-88">[88]</a> Newly arrived in the line, Blunden recognizes
that the first question put to him, “Got any peace talk?” is entirely facetious
and rhetorical. From that moment, he says, “One of the first ideas
that established themselves in my inquiring mind was the prevailing
sense of the endlessness of the war. No one here appeared to conceive
any end of it.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-89">[89]</a> And the persistence of the war (at least through 1936)
is the theme of one of Sassoon’s recurring anxiety nightmares. He reports
that he undergoes this one “every two or three months”:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>The War is still going on and I have got to return to the Front. I complain
bitterly to myself because it hasn’t stopped yet. I am worried because I can’t
find my active-service kit. I am worried because I have forgotten how to be
an officer. I feel that I can’t face it again, and sometimes I burst into tears</blockquote>
<b>(p.74)</b>
<blockquote>and say “It’s no good. I can’t do it.” But I know that I can’t escape going
back, and search frantically for my lost equipment.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-90">[90]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
The poet lvor Gurney is one in whose mind such dreams finally filled all
the space. He had fought with the Gloucester Regiment, and was
wounded and gassed in 1917. He died in a mental hospital in 1937,
where he had continued to write “war poetry,” convinced that the war
was still going on. And looking back at the war from an awareness
provided by fifty-two years of subsequent history, William Leonard
Marshall, a young “war novelist” not born until 1944, has found it appropriate
that one of his Great War characters should say, “The war’ll go
on forever-what’s the difference?” By the end of the same novel, the
continuities of modern history have brought us to Auschwitz in the forties,
where the theme of infinite war is again replayed. One prisoner’ asks
another: “When do you think the war will end?” The other shakes his
head. ‘‘I don’t know .... About 1950, I suppose-perhaps never.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-91">[91]</a>
The idea of endless war as an inevitable condition of modern life
would seem to have become seriously available to the imagination around
1916. Events, never far behindhand in fleshing out the nightmares of
imagination, obliged with the Spanish War, the Second World War, the
Greek War, the Korean War, the Arab - Israeli War, and the Vietnam
War. It was not long after the Second World War, says Alfred Kazin,
that even most liberal intellectuals abandoned the hope that that war had
really put an end to something. As he says, there were<br>
<br><blockquote>
so many uncovered horrors, so many new wars on_ the horizon, such a continued
general ominousness, that “the war” [that is, the Second] soon became
War anywhere, anytime-War that has never ended, War as the continued
experience ·of twentieth-century man.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-92">[92]</a></blockquote><br>
<br>
The 1916 image of never-ending war has about it, to be sure, a trace of
the consciously whimsical and the witty hyperbolic. But there is nothing’
but the literal in this headline from the New York Times for September 1,
1972: <br>
<br>
<blockquote>U. S. AIDES IN VIETNAM
SEE AN UNENDING WAR</blockquote><br>
<br>
Thus the drift of modern history domesticates the fantastic and normalizes
the unspeakable. And the catastrophe that begins it is the Great War.
