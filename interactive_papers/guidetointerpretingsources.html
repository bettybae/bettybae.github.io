“Guide to Interpreting Sources”<br>
<br>
<b>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES: WHY READ THEM</b><br>
<br>
Primary sources are those sources that have come down to use from an earlier
period, often created by participants in or observers of the events they describe or
for which they provide evidence. For example, a diary, a law, or a newspaper
article speaks to the outlook of the author as well as to the historical context in
which it was produced. A primary source also might come from a period after the
events it describes and may draw on or excerpt earlier sources that may or may not
still exist. Even though documentary—that is, written—sources are important as
primary sources, everything is grist for the historian’s mill. Tools, furniture,
weapons, artwork, costumes, and architecture represent nonwritten sources that can
be as important as the written word for our understanding of human society in the
past.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a historian picks and chooses among a wealth of primary sources,
focusing on those that seem to relate best to the questions being asked. At other
times a historian, especially a scholar of a remote past from which limited sources
survive, has to draw on everything that comes to hand. In either case, the historian
pieces together a picture from partial and disjointed evidence. The analogy of
putting a jigsaw puzzle is not too far off the mark, but the historian most likely
does not have all the pieces needed to create a “whole picture.” Knowing how to
fill in the gaps is where historical judgment and insight come into play.
Once a historian builds a historical interpretation based on primary sources, his or
her resulting work becomes a secondary source. Secondary sources tell us what
sources historians have used and how they have used those sources to interpret the
past. They highlight particular issues or debates and help us look at primary
sources in new and interesting ways. For this reason, some secondary sources are
included in this collection.<br>
<br>
Primary and secondary sources allow you to interpret the past for yourself. . . .
[P]rimary sources . . . are direct evidence of their time. By studying primary
sources, you can sharpen your own thinking and reach historical conclusions with
confidence. Such interpretation involves asking and answering questions, as
discussed on the next page. Mastering the questions to ask of the sources will give
you the intellectual training you need to become a good historian. These skills will
werve you well both in school and throughout your life. Today we live in a world
pervaded by the mass media and have easy access, through the Internet and other
means, to more information than we can readily process and evaluate. Learning
how to read historical sources will help you become a discriminating consumer of
information.<br>
<br>
<b>PRIMARY SOURCES: HOW TO READ THEM</b><br>
<br>
A few questions should guide your interpretation of almost any source. Here we
rehearse some of these guidelines and then interpret a sample primary source to
illustrate how you might follow them. When you first come to a primary
source . . . you should first ask the following questions.<br>
<br>
<b>Author</b> Who was the author, and when did he or she write? Several issues might
be significant to the author’s purpose and prejudices. Was the author male or
female? What was his or her economic or social status? Did the author have a
professional or employment status that might be significant? For example, if the
author was a male government minister, would his official and political position
have significantly affected his public comments about the conduct of an ongoing
war? What else might have affected the author’s understanding or ability to
observe the issues or events described?<br>
<br>
<b>Nature of the Source</b> If you are examining a written source, what is the type of
writing, and how does the specific genre affect the presentation? Is it part of a
history, a chronicle, or some other self-consciously historical work? Is it a letter
or part of a diary? Is it part of an official document?<br>
<br>
<b>(Intended) Audience</b> What can we know about the author’s intended audience?
The form or genre of the source often reveals who the intended audience was.
For example, a political treatise written in Latin was intended for an educated
male audience, while popular songs in the vernacular were calculated to reach
people from all levels of income and literacy. Sometimes the author even names
the intended audience or makes comments that only a certain audience could be
counted on to understand. The intended audience often affects the author’s style
and his or her specific arguments. For example, an author arguing in favor of
establishing colonies might shape his argument differently if preparing his text
for merchants than he would if preparing his text for government administrators.<br>
<br>
<b>Main Points</b> What are the major points that the author is trying to convey?
These points include both specific arguments and the justifications for those
arguments. The justifications for the argument might be as important as the
author’s ultimate conclusions. For example, many authors might argue that
foreigners should not be admitted into a nation, but their stated justifications
might invoke reasons based on economic, cultural, and ethnic or racial factors.<br>
<br>
<b>(Narrow) Interpretation</b> What can answers to these questions tell us about
the author’s point of view, approach, attitude, biases? Is the author trying to
promote a certain idea or image? What can the source not tell us and why?<br>
<br>
<b>(Broad) Interpretation</b> What is the historical value of the source, and how does
it contribute to our understanding of the particular author, society, and period in
question? How might you compare this source with other sources? Does it
challenge or reinforce the perspectives offered by those other sources? What can
comparing the sources tell us about the historical issue or society in question?<br>
<br>
<b>INTERPRETING A VISUAL SOURCE</b><br>
<br>
A good historian tries to make use of every source of information at his or her
disposal. While written primary sources form an important part of historical
evidence, a variety of nonwritten sources provide invaluable information and
perspectives. Nonwritten sources come in a variety of forms, including pictorial
representations, material objects, and archaeological evidence. [ . . . ] The proper
evaluation of a nonwritten source follows some of the basic guidelines that apply
when you read a written source document. For a visual source, you should ask
yourself the following questions.<br>
<br>
<b>Artist/Patron</b> Who was the artist or creator the image? If this is not known, what
can we know about the person who commissioned the image to be made or about
the context in which the image appeared? For example, did the commissioner of a
woodcut print stand to gain financially or politically from the widespread
circulation of the image and its underlying message?<br>
<br>
<b>Nature of the Image</b> What is the type of image, and how does the specific artistic
form affect the presentation? For example, a formal portrait, designed to appear in
a structured environment that allows careful viewing, permits artistic detail and
nuance, whereas a wall poster, designed to appear in any context and likely to be
viewed fleetingly, requires blunt images and messages.<br>
<br>
<b>(Intended) Viewers</b> Was the source meant originally for private viewing or for
public consumption? What was the nature of its intended audience? Did it circulate
beyond its intended audience, and what can we know about how it was appreciated
or used? For example, we might distinguish between a political message conveyed
in an unpublished private letter and one that was articulated in the columns of a
printed newspaper.<br>
<br>
<b>Message of the Image</b> What are the major points that the artist/patron is trying to
convey by means of this particular representation? These often may be understood
by comparing the internal components of the painting or by comparing the
components of the painting with general social norms and values of the time.<br>
<br>
<b>(Narrow) Interpretation</b> What can answers to the above questions tell us about
the point of view, approach, biases, and attitude of the creator of the image?<br>
<br>
<b>(Broad) Interpretation</b> What is the historical value of the source, and how
does it contribute to our understanding of a particular individual, group, or
society? What does comparison with other sources tell us about the historical
theme in question?<br>
<br>
<b>READING A SECONDARY SOURCE</b><br>
<br>
History is a collective enterprise. Historians rely on the work of other historians
to learn what events happened and also what questions to ask when approaching
the past. Sometimes this process involves engaging in a debate—typically
through secondary sources such as books and articles—over what constitutes the
best interpretation of the available primary sources. [ . . . ] The proper evaluation
of a secondary source follows some of the basic guidelines for other types of
sources. In reading a secondary source, you should ask yourself the following
questions.<br>
<br>
<b>Author</b> Who was the author of the article or book chapter? Can you tell in what
ways his or her training or background contributed to how the argument is
presented? For example, how might a historian of ancient Greece explain the rise
of Western civilization differently from a historical sociologist or political
scientist?<br>
<br>
<b>Use of Primary Sources</b> How does the scholar integrate the use of primary
sources in his or her argument? Is this a good model for you to follow?<br>
<br>
<b>The Point or Argument</b> What are the major points that the scholar is trying to
convey?<br>
<br>
<b>(Narrow) Interpretation</b> What does investigating the above questions tell us
about the specific argument made by the scholar?<br>
<br>
<b>(Broad) Interpretation</b> What is the historical relevance of the argument, and
how does it contribute to our understanding of the broader themes of the chapter?<br>
