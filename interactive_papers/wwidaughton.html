No Man's Land
By Stephen Bull
"No Man's Land" was a popular term during the First World War to describe the area
between opposing armies and trench lines. How it came to exist and how far it might extend
was influenced by a variety of military and topographic factors.

Selected Bibliography

The English term "No Man's Land" has existed since the medieval era to denote disputed territory. In
the First World War it was re-coined to describe the terrain between opposing forces, particularly
where fronts were static, gaining common currency from late 1914. The term remains current, and is
used more broadly to indicate areas of ambiguity and lack of ownership as well as military situations.
Sometimes generals of the First World War influenced, to advantage, where this dangerous strip of
ground lay by positioning forces on ridges, or behind obstacles, overlooking good fields of fire. Often,
however, "No Man's Land" arose in a particular location by chance, as offensives ended, or armies
encountered each other and entrenched wherever they could. "No Man's Land" therefore varied
dramatically according to geography and happenstance. Its boundaries might be clearly defined by
belts of wire and trench lines or natural features, or unclear and fluid. On the Yser the distance
between Belgians and Germans was at times just a few yards of wet mud. On Vimy Ridge and at the
Butte de Vauquois Canadians and French occupied craters on hills adjoining those of the Germans.
Conversely, where land was deliberately flooded, or armies confronted each other across wide rivers,
or on quieter sectors of the Eastern Front, "No Man's Land" could be miles wide.

Origins of the Term
World War One
Raids and patrols into "No Man's Land" between the protagonists of the Western Front took place as
early as late 1914, and were encouraged as a method of gleaning intelligence and striking small
demoralising blows. However, the threatening emptiness of this mysterious strip of land was
notorious, being much enhanced by the difficulty and danger of retrieving the wounded or dead. In
part therefore "No Man's Land" was a function of the lethality of modern weapons at short range – so
linking the concepts of "No Man's Land" and the new experience of the "empty battlefield."

<Embusque>
The embusqué referred to the French soldier who refused to fight on the front line by seeking out quiet postings at the rear. Cowardly, effeminate and chic, the dodger’s uselessness haunted the administrative services behind the lines. This figure of war was the physical and moral antithesis of the poilu; it was supposed to unite all Frenchmen in unanimous reprobation and heap guilt on those who wanted to remain outside the conflict. (http://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/propaganda_at_home_france)
<Embusque>
For a long time, historiography really insisted on the differences and tension between the front, occupied territories and life behind the lines. There was indeed very real tension that was expressed various ways. Incomprehension sometimes arose, for example, when soldiers discovered, during leave or periods of convalescence, that life behind the lines carried on, including leisure, artistic and cultural activities. The poilus–particularly those from rural areas–also had trouble understanding the strikes that took place in some factories. They often felt that workers were privileged and that their demands were not very legitimate. Figures such as “war profiteers” or “embusqués” (shirkers) were omnipresent during the war and embodied the tension that existed between the front and those behind the lines who were often suspected of shirking their duties and the equality of all before such responsibilities.

 In the Folklore student in Belgium , the hair and feathers are students who have completed or successful and their Baptism , and who therefore left the status of Blues and Bleuettes .They can wear the penne or cap according to tradition in force in their circle and faculty stand as candidate for Comitard a student baptism Committee or circle, freely participate in Guindailles and Cantus. Traditionally, they carry a guindaille apron decorated with drawings and graffiti. The transition between the status of blue / bleuette and the hair / feathers varies depending on the university and the faculty.  The last initiation test (discount penne Liège , baptism degree at the ULB and the UCL , ...) is not always explicit about this change in status.  But it is widely recognized that a student who spent baptized (successfully or not) the end of year examinations took the plunge.  The port at least two stars / bolts on the penne / cap is therefore the symbol. The words "good" and "pen" are rooted in Polytechnic Circle of the Free University of Brussels.

<L'Echo des Marmites>

By displaying the date of its creation on December 7, 1914, Echo pots itself as one of the oldest newspapers trenches. Published December 1914 to May 1918 (its release is stopped at the time of resumption of the war of movement), Echo pots is the body of the 309th Infantry Regiment. It will include 26 issues, more or less monthly. The indication of "only daily periodical" is purely fanciful, the Gazette had never been daily, and alluded to the issue of hazards.
Each issue contains from 8 to 12 size pages 20 to 27 cm, which is quite rare, most newspapers is limited to 4 pages. Its editor Robert Layus (1886-1967), a sergeant in the 309th, is a member of the Parisian elite and has the means to print his Echo pots in the capital in 1500 copies; it also sends the numbers to President Poincare, General Headquarters, and the main Parisian dailies. Jules Rene Herve painter (1887-1981), career already full even before war, a 1914 voluntary commitment and sign the drawings.

bourrage de crane
- Literally means, “stuffing their brains with rubbish.”[1]. It is an expression quickly became popular to characterize the nature and quality of official information: Brain-washing/Propaganda

pinard / wine 
:  term became wrapped up in the public conception of the poilu ("hairy one", the typical French foot soldier) and his loved pinard, joined in a "cult of wine".

Official censorship was enforced, though sporadically; self-censorship within newspaper staffs was more likley, as editors used their best judgement in deciding what was inappropriate to print. Similarly, though many articles targeted official “eyewash,” trench papers were not totally free of propaganda. See Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, 20-33.

However, the term, based upon the soldiers’ hair, became a metaphor for a wider political spirit, through concepts of masculinity and participation in the discourse of the French Republic.</b><br><br><b>The Hairy Ones</b><br><br>The literal translation of Le Poilu is “the hairy one” and it is used as an informal collective term to describe the men who made up the French infantry soldiers during the First World War. However, it is also representative of a national and political identity which these men embraced as both a reaction to the war and their own conception of republican France.<br><br>At its most basic level, the term Poilu refers to the appearance of the regular French infantryman. It became custom for French soldiers to grow their hair and beards long at the outbreak of the war as an expression of their masculinity. The term first rose to wider prominence in the 1834 story by Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850), Le Médecin de Campagne. In the novel, a highly dangerous mission requires the participation of a group of French soldiers with only forty men being deemed hairy enough to undertake it.<br><br>Hair as a signifier for masculinity and strength has its roots in the biblical tale of Samson, but with Le Poilu it found an additional resonance in regards to the way the First World War was waged and the reasons behind it. The nature of trench warfare, with soldiers rapidly coming to live a semi-subterranean life within the mud and dirt of La Patrie, convinced French soldiers that it was not possible to fight such a conflict without embracing this mud and dirt. It was not possible to save the country they loved without immersing themselves in its very ground, by becoming dirty, and hairy, and embracing a sense of base masculinity.<br><br>This position often put them at odds with British soldiers in particular, as the British soldierly identity of the “Tommy” was heavily predicated on the importance of a clean appearance in maintaining discipline and fostering a military spirit. As a result, to British eyes, the French often appeared unkempt and ill-disciplined.<br><br>Additionally, this manifestation of the French warrior spirit also links back to the French rural tradition of men working the fields and the soil of La Patrie in a manner that speaks of both an honest masculinity but also a deep love and appreciation of France as the mother and sustainer of the French people. Beyond this, it also gave an outlet for the expression of the republican identity these men created for themselves.<br><br><b>Les Poilus and Republican Identity</b><br><br>Since the earliest days of the French Revolution, Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s (1712-1778) declaration; “Every soldier a citizen, every citizen a soldier” has described the binary relationship between the people of France and their role in its preservation and defense. However, this relationship is also one of community, participation and debate. The soldiers of the First World War did not view themselves as passive pieces in this situation, devoid of opinion or agency. Les Poilus were fighting for France and they had very particular beliefs about what “France” represented and how best it would be defended.<br><br>These positions became clear during the French mutinies of 1917 during and after the failed offensive at the Chemin des Dames. When it became clear that General Robert Nivelle (1856-1924), then French commander-in-chief, was not going to secure a decisive victory and that French casualties were rapidly growing, reports began to surface of French soldiers baa-ing like sheep on their way to slaughter as they passed up the lines towards the battle. This movement spread in a wider display of political dissent as soldiers in the area refused to attack. Their message to the French military command was that they would continue to defend the land of their country but they were not willing to cast away their lives in a pointless offensive.<br><br>On the surface, this might appear a simple act of non-political mutiny. However, Les Poilus viewed themselves to be the descendants of those republican soldiers who had built modern France; they believed that both the country and its citizen-soldiers deserved better than death in attempting the unachievable. It was only by addressing the political motivations of these mutinies that General Philippe Pétain (1856-1951), Nivelle’s replacement, was able to rebuild the morale and fighting effectiveness of the French army. These measures allowed the French infantry to play a crucial role in the eventual victory of 1918, not simply through their own strength of arms, but through achieving it in a manner that was compatible with their own identity and belief in what the war was for and how it must be fought.<br><br><b>Post-war</b><br><br>Whilst the eventual victory had been sufficiently Poilu-esque, and many of those who had served in the French army continued to take pride in their wartime identity, many soldiers began to look outwards in their desire to maintain the peace they had won. The rise of internationalism saw many former Poilus attempt to foster cooperation between the various combatants during the inter-war years. The eventual failure of this attempt followed by the defeat of the French army in 1940 meant that the Poilu identity did not reemerge as a cohesive movement during the Second World War.<br><br>Chris Kempshall, University of Sussex<br><br><b>Section Editor:</b> Alexandre Lafon<br><br><b>Selected Bibliography</b><br><br>Audoin-Rouzeau, Stéphane / Becker, Annette: 1914-1918.

<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-202">[Outline of Article as a Series of Questions]</a><br><br>
On a cool morning in the early autumn of 1915, a French infantryman leaves his post at the western front for a few days at home, <i>en permission</i>. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s eyes remain fixed on the trenches as he walks away. He takes with him heavy souvenirs of battle: German helmets, weapons, and a large, unexploded shell. By evening, he arrives at the homefront, in the midst of his previous life, where his wife and children excitedly await his train. The wife hugs and kisses her husband while the younger children fight for their father’s attention; the aloof order son, proudly donning his father’s cap, is fascinated with a real shell brought from the front. At home, with the children asleep, the wife puts on her nightgown, climbs into bed<del> and awaits her husband</del>. She seductively props her head on thick pillows and awaits her husband, then gasps when she notices him, fully-clothed, already asleep on the floor beside the bed. The next morning, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> entertains himself by playing with his children. But when the play gets rough, the soldier takes out his rifle, and brandishes a dagger. Losing control of himself, he kicks a chair, and knocks the couch over, pinning his son beneath it. His wife yells at him to stop, and chases him out of the house. Later that afternoon, while peacefully working in the garden, the wife smells a terrible stench. She takes hold of her child when she notices the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> hunched behind some potted plans, defecating <del>in the <i>feuillées</i></del>. The next day, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> returns to the front. Having left his war souvenirs at home, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> carries supplies for his battalion and a couple bottles of wine.<br>
<br>
The story of this nameless infantryman’s trip home appeared as a cartoon in a French trench newspaper, <i>Le 3ème Bataillon</i> (no. 17, 24 September 1915). “En Permission” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-41">Figure 1</a>) is narrated almost completely with pictures, each drawing depicted with humor and playfulness. The huge shell, the children starved for attention, the wife’s facial expressions of shock, horror and disgust, and the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s mindless behavior are all exaggerated for comic effect. The stupidity of the <b>(p.37)</b> soldier—his inability to distinguish between the “habits” and “regulations” of trench life and the enjoyment of civilian comforts—lends a farcical element. And word plays, such as the imprint <i>Fabrication Boche</i> on the shell and the sign <i>Feuillées</i> in the garden, add subtle humorous touches. Cartoons such as “En Permission” offered men at the front what must have been a much needed, if brief, moment of amusement. Yet the narrative of “En Permission” also candidly portrays the detrimental psychological consequences of the war experience on the combatant. Along with death, the fear of returning home from the war permanently scarred, physically or psychologically, caused the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> constant anxiety. Behind the comedy of this cartoon, lies the story of a soldier so accustomed to war that he literally brings remnants of its destructiveness home with him. Even after reuniting with his wife and children—two symbols of the home front—the soldier is unable to abandon his trench habits. His detachment from civilian life is so complete that, when he returns to the front, he brings with him no visible souvenirs from home, just supplies.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2]</a> Cartoons such as “En Permission” were not simply humorous distractions. They provided both cartoonists and readers the opportunity to reflect on and communicate the attitudes and emotions of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, and the wider soldier community at the front. Rather than revealing specific personal views of the war, trench cartoons offer sketches of the beliefs, concerns, and daily desires—the mentalité—of the common <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> in the trenches. Bust, as such, do cartoons suggest anything new about this character so often discussed in historical literature on the Great War?<br>
<br>
A substantial amount of recent scholarship has attempted to recreate the mental world of the average infantryman of the First World War.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3]</a> The literature, diaries, and letters of soldiers describe individuals’ first-hand experiences of the war—fear, boredom, frustration, death—often in vivid detail. But these sources post a number of problems. Literature and memoirs are prone, in the words of Eugen Weber, to “<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-201">rancorous exaggerations</a>.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4]</a> When and where were diaries and letters written, why and for whom? Were they spontaneous outpourings of thoughts and feelings, or rather carefully crafted, and limited to certain facets of the soldier’s experience so as to ease the concerns of loved-ones?<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5]</a> A somewhat different kind of source is offered in trench journalism. Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau has persuasively shown that trench journalism, in the French case, differs from memoirs and letters because the unidealized views of daily life published in trench papers were written not only <i>by</i> soldiers, but <i>for</i> them as well.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6">[6]</a> Although many trench papers claimed principally to offer troops momentary amusement, they also offered soldiers the opportunity to rewrite the glorified stories of heroism—the <i>bourrage de crâne</i> (literally “head-stuffing”, or “eye-wash”)—published in the national press. The scrutiny of the soldiers who read the papers encouraged authenticity of reporting. Trench journals, according to Audoin-Rouzeau, presented “opportunities for self-expression,” fulfilling “the fighting troops’ desire to rise above the daily misery of war, to bear witness, and to regain some <b>(p.38)</b> dignity through writing.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7">[7]</a> Editors and staff of trench papers, though often not located in the front-line trenches, were in constant contact with their readership and responded to <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>’ “concerns, interests, grievances and hopes.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8">[8]</a><br>
<br>
Though his analysis of trench prose journalism is exhaustive, Audoin-Rouzeau chose not to examine trench cartoons, which appeared in the majority of trench papers.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-9">[9]</a> In fact, trench cartoons are a unique kind of source, functioning differently from prose journalism on a number of levels. By definition, cartoons offered a communal, rather than individual view of the war. Though a single cartoonist draws a cartoon, in order to be successful—that is, to be funny, ironic, satirical—the cartoon’s theme must be immediately recognizable to the reader. The reader must see the topic of the cartoon as authentic, as having some relation to a situation, thought, or fantasy that has been witnessed, experienced, or imagined by the reader. For this reason, the theme, more than quality of drawing or wittiness of text, is the key to a cartoon’s success.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-10">[10]</a> Once the subject is established, cartoons subvert or distort the real situations or emotions for comic effect. This fact requires cartoonists to be especially sensitive to their readers’ perceptions of and attitudes toward those situations. In subverting daily life at the front, trench cartoons usually reveal two—and sometimes more—sets of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> sensibilities. For example, in the case of “En Permission”, though the cartoon speaks to anxieties over the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s return from the front, it also reveals a keen understanding of the comforts of home life, and the different forms of behavior typical to military and civilian life. The humor of this cartoon depends upon the reader comprehending not only why the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> might sleep on the floor (trench habit), but also the fact that he <i>should</i> very much want to sleep in the bed (a cherished luxury of the homefront). In this case as well as others, the trench cartoon reveals aspects both of soldiers’ attitudes towards the war experience, and their perception and appreciation of the norms of civilian life. <br>
<br>
Though it is difficult to assess the reception of individual cartoons, in general, trench cartoons were popular with their readership. Some papers reserved an entire page (out of a four page layout) for cartoons, while others had a number of cartoons spread throughout the journal. And at least two papers, <i>Face aux Boches Illustré</i> and <i>L’Image</i>, published cartoons exclusively. The prevalence of these cartoons suggests soldiers’ desire to reproduce and utilize in the trenches all the forms of expression available to civilian French society. Cartoons, and drawings more generally, gave trench papers an aesthetic, visual sophistication similar to mass-produced papers printed in Paris or other cities. Though technological limitations usually prohibited the reproduction of photographs, most trench papers included drawings, such as portraits of soldiers, sketches of military equipment, and landscapes. But the inclusion of cartoons not only allowed trench editors to recreate, within limits, the look and feel of civilian newspapers. The cartoon itself had a particularly rich history in pre-war French society, from popular cartoons of the Revolutionary period, to the <b>(p.39)</b> political satire of Daumier and the cartoons of mass-produced newspapers such as <i>L’Illustration</i>. Cartoons enabled <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> to portray and give meaning to the new experiences of the war through a well-known and popular cultural medium.<br>
<br>
Trench cartoons, like the papers in which they appeared, were produced under a variety of circumstances shaped by the location of the cartoonist in relation to the front, the volatility of fighting in his area, and the role of his battalion in the war. Further, trench cartoons were created by individuals of varying talent and acumen, including amateurs who produced rudimentary sketches, and, more commonly, skilled artists who created elaborate drawings and scenarios. Although certain cartoons offered vivid personal responses to the miseries of war, what is perhaps more striking is the repetition of common subjects in trench cartoons from diverse parts of the war. This consistency was in part due to the fact that soldiers were frequently replaced, relieved, shifted from front-line trenches to secondary, support trenches, as well as to different areas of the front as dictated by military strategy. This constant moving from one position to another meant that a large number of soldiers shared the same wide range of experiences during the war. As a result, most trench papers published cartoons drawing on a set of experiences: combat, life in support trenches, work duty near the front, and home leave.<br>
<br>
Cartoon themes also did not change substantially over time, though a few chronological generalizations can be made. For instance, the theme of the enemy, and French <i>versus</i> German national characteristics were more prevalent during the first half of the war, and considerably less common after 1917. Similarly, cartoonists increasingly turned to the topic of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> trench life, the <i>embusqué</i>, <i>la permission</i>, and the pleasures of the homefront as the war progressed, from 1916 to the end. Again, the nature of the war on the western front explains much of this chronology. From the first months of 1915 until the so-called war of movement resumed after the second battle of the Marne in July 1918, life at the front was fairly consistent for most soldiers. The ideal of <i>tenir</i> (”to hold”) largely guided French military strategy. French soldiers built trenches and assumed a defensive stance in the hopes of slowly wearing down the enemy. Besides pitched battle, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, therefore, faced many hours interacting with comrades, doing daily chores and manual labor, avoiding boredom, and reflecting on trench life and the war.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-11">[11]</a> The repetition of certain themes in cartoons suggest that they both reflected and helped articulate a kind of trench community which emerged after 1915. Cartoons helped define and reinforce standards of behavior in the trenches, by portraying pastimes, spreading jokes, and even examining accepted moral codes.<br>
<br>
Cartoons, as well as the papers in which they were printed, were cultural products of this trench community. As the war progressed, cartoons drew on <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> daily activities and experiences for subject matter, giving voice to and perpetuating a complex set of soldier attitudes, emotions, and anxieties. The sensibilities of this <b>(p.40)</b> trench community were not shaped solely by the harsh experiences of war, but were also influenced by French society from which <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> came, and with which <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> interacted throughout the war. Cartoons indicate the difficulties <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> faced in reconciling their contrasting attitudes, emotions and moral values regarding a variety of topics, such as the enemy, the myriad experiences of daily life at the front, women, <i>embusqués</i>, and the comforts of civilian life. Rather than providing specific insights into the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s every fear, thought, and belief, trench cartoons were most successful at reflecting and perpetuating general <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> concerns.<br>
<br>
Three aspects of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a> mentalité</i> were especially well depicted in trench cartoons. First, trench cartoons were not limited to a portrayal of trench life as a one-dimensional, never-ending life of misery. The monotony interspersed with terror which characterized much of trench life was relieved occasionally in periods of rest, trips home, and even dreams. Cartoons defined the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, and portrayed his daily thoughts and feelings in a variety of activities, from hand-to-hand combat to getting drunk. Although the image of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was common in national publications, trench cartoonists created a more socially and psychologically nuanced version of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> than the boyish, playful image of the homefront.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-12">[12]</a> Second, cartoons suggest that <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> made moral judgements about themselves, the enemy, the allies, colonial soldiers, and various members and activities of the homefront.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-13">[13]</a> In conceptualizing <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> moral values, the metaphor of geography is instructive. In trench cartoons, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was held in highest esteem, morally righteous, risking his life, defending the nation. The importance of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s role as soldier was never questioned. Cartoonists most clearly establish this by using the enemy as a foil. Beyond the trenches, however, <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> envisioned a range of moral value based on citizens’ distance—in both mind and body—from the front. In general, those who supported the war effort in practice and spirit were revered in trench cartoons, while those who feared or ignored it were ridiculed. Within this scheme, there were further distinctions, shaped in part by considerations of class, gender, and less commonly, race. For example, as will be shown in more detail, cartoonists did not treat even the most frivolous women of the homefront as vindictively as their wealthy, male <i>embusqué</i> counterparts. In this sense, cartoons broke down the apparent dichotomy of front <i>versus</i> homefront into more subtle moral categories. And third, even though trench cartoons chastised the fun-loving ways of urban elites, they also celebrated, if not exalted, the very comforts of civilization the elites enjoyed. The luxury of home life represented both a tool with which to critique the indifferent civilian, and an object of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> desires and even fantasies. Although cartoons functions very differently from official propaganda, they in some cases shared similar ends. Trench cartoons did not glorify the war experience, nor did they rely on simple symbols such as <i>devoir</i> or even <i>La France</i>. But, morally, in cartoons and propaganda alike, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> symbolized a national moral ideal. And, further, by reproducing images of civilization, <b>(p.41)</b> represented not by national icons, but by the simple comforts of civilian life, cartoons reminded <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> of the necessity of war in terms they could appreciate, encouraging them to continue fighting.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>[4.1] The Enemy: A Foil Unquestioned by Soldiers and Propagandists Alike</b><br>
<br>
Representations of the enemy in trench cartoons suggests that <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> did not dismiss all of the characterizations of official propaganda. Both cartoons and propaganda treated the enemy as a foil to the righteousness of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. This similarity reveals the difficulties in separating the representations <i>bourrage de crâne</i> from what might be considered more “authentic” <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> representations. Cartoons about the enemy commonly depicted German soldiers as barbaric and dishonest criminals, or as stupid weaklings, lacking the discipline to fight. For example, <i>Le Petit Echo du 18e Territorial</i> (no. 65, 6 Feb. 1915) printed three drawings of German treachery: a blimp raiding a town, a German submarine prowling the oceans, and a smiling German soldier walking away from a child he has just shot. In another issue of the same paper (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-107">no. 58, 19 Dec. 1915</a>), German diplomatic cunning was depicted in a drawing of Kaiser “Guillaume” offering a “dishonest proposition” of Peace (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-42">Figure 2</a>). This Peace is not the traditional female icon of youth, grace and beauty, but a pudgy old woman, battered, missing an arm and a leg. Around her neck hangs the German iron cross, and her skirt is decorated with skulls and bones. Behind “Guillaume’s” back is the blunt tool used to shape this Peace. These cartoons particularly resemble official propaganda because they play on the fears, not of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, but of the nation: the vicious German troops, the wily German government. The victims of German aggression are not soldiers, but rather the nation and its civilians, particularly women and children.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-14">[14]</a> But by victimizing only the innocent, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was the unmentioned savior of these cartoons—honorable, brave, just. The soldier was not motivated by self-interest, defending himself. Rather, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was selfless, the nation’s defender, symbolizing France’s hope.<br>
<br>
Other cartoons drew on familiar generalizations and symbols of national differences in order to contrast morally and culturally the two sides at war. On the front page of <i>Le Mouchoir</i> (no. 29, 11 June 1916), under the heading “The Two Crosses,” is the image of a German soldier crouched in a threatening position, a torch in one hand and a bloody dagger in the other. Confronting him, a noble <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> stands tall, protecting a terrified woman and child behind him. As though the imagery is not clear enough, the artist labeled the German as “Murder”, the Frenchman as “Honor.” A cartoon in <i>L’Image</i> (no. 21, 1917) portrays a German soldier as “The Grim Reaper” on horseback with a large sickle. Two issues of <i>L’Echo de Tranchéesville</i> (no. 5, 19 August 1915, and no. 6, 26 August 1915) use images of women to exemplify German baseness and French dignity. In the first of these cartoons, “Parisian life at the front” is a beautiful woman in a gown: with an olive branch in one hand, and a sword in the other, she glides over broken German helmets in No Man’s Land. The following week, a much less glamorous woman, wearing a gas mask, and spraying chemicals symbolizes “Berlin life at the front.” Images of women commonly <b>(p.43)</b> represented the differences between French and German cultures in official propaganda: the French “Marianne” was graceful, beautiful, refined (though often frivolous), while “Germania” was barbaric, severe, discipline, masculine.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-15">[15]</a><br>
<br>
The helpless buffoon was another common type used in representing the German soldier. For example, in one cartoon, a German soldier holds his aching feet, crying, “Damn, I cannot march any more, Paris is too far!” (<i>La Barbe . . . Leé</i>, n.d.) In a cartoon from <i>Face aux Boches Illustré</i> (no. 11, July 1916) entitled “The influence of the <i>delikatessen</i> on the <i>boches</i>” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-43">Figure 3</a>). French soldiers cast a long fishing pole across No Man’s Land, using a ham as bait. A German falls for the trick with an enthusiastic “Gott, Himmel! A beautiful ham!” As he grabs hold of the ham, a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> shoots an arrow from his trench, piercing both the ham and the German’s hands. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> reel in their German catch, bringing <i>boche</i> after <i>boche</i> as more enemy soldiers join the futile tug of war. In the end, the French capture a string of Germans, along with their machine gun. This cartoon is strikingly similar in tone to national newspapers <b>(p.44)</b> and official propaganda which reported the ineffectiveness of German fighting at the beginning of the war. In October of 1914, the <i>Petit Parisien</i> claimed that “our troops laugh at machine-guns now. . . . Nobody pays the slightest attention to them.” And in November, the <i>Journal</i> commented, “Bluff, rubbish and double Dutch—that’s how to sum up that famous science from across the Rhine.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-16">[16]</a> This <i>bourrage de crâne</i> was meant to suppress French national fears of being defeated by the enemy—an understandable anxiety considering that initial German advances, curtailed only at the Marne, left the German army entrenched well within the French border. The <i>delikatessen</i> cartoon addresses these same concerns, but with the added dimension of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s resourcefulness: French ingenuity can be more effective than German treachery, French plotting (the fishing pole) will overcome German brutality (the machine gun). <br>
<br>
Even though some cartoons resembled propagandists’ images of the enemy, trench cartoonists often embellished these types with subject matter important to <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>. Trench cartoons like “The influence of the <i>delikatessen</i>” spoke to an exclusively <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> anxiety: the fear of German weapons technology. The carnage and butchery of modern warfare caused anger and despair in the trenches. One machine gun equaled the fire power of sixty men with repeating rifles; hand grenades and artillery could kill a number of men at once; mustard gas blistered the skin and lungs, and caused temporary blindness.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-17">[17]</a> In a cartoon with the caption “Fritz goes little by little” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-44">Figure 4</a>) in <i>Le Gafouilleur</i> (no. 26, 1 May 1917) these fears were projected onto the enemy. Here, “Fritz” is being blown apart, piece by piece. In this sense, the cartoon was a kind of rallying cry, encouraging men to keep fighting, suggesting that it was just a matter of time before Fritz was either fully dismembered, or retreated. But rather than using traditional images of <i>devoir</i> and honor, this cartoon appealed to soldiers’ own understanding of war. Maurice Genevoix’s <i>Les Eparges</i> uses imagery eerily similar to the cartoon’s: “Increasingly often, as we became more weary, feverish images were thrown up among the shell bursts: of jumping up with our bodies in fragments; of falling back onto the parapet with broken backs . . . ; of being headless, our heads torn off in a single blow, like Grondin . . . whose head came rolling down to us. . . . <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-18">[18]</a> The cartoon’s graphic violence contrasts with the lyrical caption beneath it, a nostalgic axiom about departure:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>To leave is to die a little<br>
We leave a bit of ourselves<br>
Always and everywhere. . . . </blockquote><br>
<br>
In the context of Fritz’s predicament, “to leave a bit of oneself” is no metaphor. Although this cartoon expressed anxieties specific to <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, it also offered hope: the imminent destruction of the enemy. Though cartoons such as this did not exhibit the false optimism of eyewash, the <i>message</i> of trench cartoons about the enemy was <b>(p.45)</b> little different from the official propaganda: the <i>Boches</i> are cunning and murderous, or stupid and misguided, and they threaten the French nation. Either conception justified their defeat by the superior “civilization” of the French. <i>Poilus</i>, therefore, clearly did not dismiss all assumptions of official propagandists. But trench cartoons were not simply propaganda; rather, they employed and adapted types popular in the wider, national community, and recontextualized them by giving them new forms that spoke more directly to veterans of the front, appealing to their sensibilities. Unlike propagandists, whose pro-French message was the end in itself, trench cartoonists employed images of the enemy as foils in order to begin to define the complexities of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> identity, especially the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s moral position.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.2] The <i>Poilu</i> and the Trench Community</b><br>
<br>
If the <i>Boches</i> were clearly defined by trench and “official” images as bloodthirsty and hateful, then who was the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>? In national typology and trench cartoons alike, <b>(p.46)</b> the french soldier represented values in opposition to the enemy: the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was brave, self-sacrificing, honorable—the defenders of the nation. But it is clear from other trench cartoons that <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> self-perception was not limited to national expectations. Trench cartoons portray the attitudes, fears and desires not of heroes, but of ordinary men. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a> mentalité</i> was shaped not by individual social or economic background, or political views, but by experiences, emotions, and thoughts shared in the first line, in reserve trenches, <i>au repos</i>, and <i>en permission</i>. Trench cartoons gave meaning to, and perpetuated a coherent definition of the trench community.<br>
<br>
Trench cartoons, like other sources from the trenches, were apolitical: military decisions were never questioned, and national politics rarely critiqued.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-19">[19]</a> Infrequently, cartoons satirize the inefficient administration of the war. For instance, in <i>La Bataillon</i> (no. 56, 11 April 1916), a cartoon portrays fat soldiers squeezing into tiny uniforms, while thin men don tent-sized fatigues. And in a cartoon in <i>Le Canard Dieppois</i> (no. 15, 20 September 1916), a nurse asks a doctor, who is seated at a desk, when the war will end. The doctor answers cynically: “When we run out of paper.” Neither of these cartoons openly criticized specific culprits, rather they expressed a general frustration that the welfare of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was in the hands of a distant bureaucratic machine. Practical reasons very likely determined the lack of politics in trench papers. Although military officials looked kindly on trench papers, they would have viewed other open criticism as dangerous to morale, if not insubordination.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-20">[20]</a> Further, papers that adopted an ideological stance risked alienating members of their readership. Political discussions tend to divide people; trench papers aimed to unify their readership. <br>
<br>
Class differences among <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, including distinctions between peasants and urbanites, are rare mentioned. In <i>Le Poilu du 37</i> (no. 2, 2e année, n.d.), two “literary” <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> are standing in a trench. One of them is reading a paper, while the other asks, “What’s playing at the Odeon tonight?” Although the “literary” type might have been represented as a largely urban, educated, even bourgeois soldier, the cartoon does not employ these features for humor. Instead, the irony of the cartoon is derived from the distance between the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s interest and his geographical locale. In <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-104">no. 19, 25 April 1917</a>) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-45">Figure 5</a>), portraits of the types of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>in “La Nation Armée” play on standard caricatures of men of different classes and occupations: from the pointed beard of the <i>artiste</i> to the weathered face of the worker, and the cigarette holder of the aristocrat. The cartoonist here draws on the visual types of the wider society. But what is striking about his image is how the individual characteristics of each type are undermined. As a group, these men are identifiable foremost as <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, not just because of the heading <i>types de <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, but because of their dress. Each face is framed by the French infantryman’s helmet and the unadorned collar of the military uniform, asserting their collective identity as much as their individual differences. Further, with the exception of “Le Commis Voyageur”, each face wears a similar, weary expression.<br>
<br>

<b>(p.47)</b> One distinction, however, is made clear in trench cartoons: the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> is French and white. Black soldiers from the French colonies are portrayed much like the enemy, as stupid and even savage. In <i>Le Front</i> (no. 10, 16 November 1916), a black soldier standing guard stops a white <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> at a check point, insisting “You can’t pass unless you say ‘Fontainbleau.’” Here, by neglecting his job at the checkpoint (by asking for and giving out the password), the colonial soldier poses a potential threat to national security. In a series of “Camp Festival” cartoons in <i>Le Petit Echo du 18e </i><b>(p.48)</b> <i> Territorial</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-108">no. 96, 10 September 1916</a>) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-46">Figure 6</a>), friendly competition between French and colonial soldiers offers the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> a chance to jeer their supposed comrades. In one cartoon, two white soldiers are bent over with laughter as colonial soldiers struggle past in a sack race. In others, the defeat of colonial soldiers in contests such as foot race and wrestling match asserts the racial superiority of the white competitors. In a drawing called “Danses nègres” two black men, twisted in absurd contortions, are depicted like monkeys, with oversized hands and huge lips. Two <b>(p.49)</b> cartoons in <i>Le Bataillon</i> (nos. 51 and 55, 20 June 1916 and 4 October 1916) equate being black with savagery and brutality. The first tells the story of a white <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> who arrives at the trenches, and is painted black by a caricatured black soldier who assures the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> that everyone at the front goes through it. The next picture portrays the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> as a black savage rushing the enemy trenches. A German soldier is so terrified by the approaching vision that he throws up his hands and begs for mercy. A second cartoon represents the cure of the “Maladie Noire”—the disease of becoming black which apparently afflicts white <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> who have spent time in the trenches. On one level, this “illness” refers to the filth of trench life. But again the soldiers are not only darkened, they possess caricatured black features and seek a doctor’s advice. If mud were the only problem, bathing would be a sufficient cure. Cartoons depicting the barbaric racial attributes of colonial soldiers can be linked to at least two <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> anxieties. First, these cartoons express a fear of being brutalized, or made “savage” by the war. Throughout the nineteenth century, orientalist art, literature, and advertising regularly depicted non-Europeans as “savages.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-21">[21]</a> This presented cartoonists with a ready-made metaphor. These cartoons played on white French soldiers’ anxieties as well. The presence of colonial soldiers in norther France was perceived by <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>as a temptation to French women.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-22">[22] </a> This was no small threat to <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> considering that about half a million colonial soldiers served in the war. Portraying colonial soldiers as ape-like and physically inferior undermined the stereotype of presumed sexual potency. Ultimately, these cartoons defined the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, and his white community, against the colonial “other” by delineating racially-based differences of behavior both in battle and <i>au repos</i>. By exploiting images of colonial soldiers, the cartoonist of <i>Le Bataillon</i> suggest that, in the trenches, white soldiers could claim a certain level of dignity, civility, and respectability. <br>
<br>
Most trench cartoons illustrated the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> without using foils such as colonial soldiers, often by simply listing <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> attitudes and desires. <i>Poilu</i> “likes and dislikes” were the topic of a cartoon in <i>Face aux Boches</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-101">no. 10, June 1916</a>). Likes included hot food, letters, the arrival of relief troops, <i>la permission</i>, and especially <i>le pinard</i>—the cheap wine which all <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> consumed when given the opportunity. Dislikes revealed the ugliness of trench life: mud, lice, rats, shelling, and walking with heavy supplies. Also disliked by the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a> was arduous <i<repos</i>. Although <i>repos</i> means rest, this time away from the front line was often associated with exhausting work.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-23">[23]</a> This attitude is apparent, as the men returning from their “rest” show sings of fatigue, while the men returning from the trenches are plump and content. Though this contrast was exaggerated for humor’s sake, it suggests that <i>au repos</i> was not always synonymous with an easy post. After the Battle of Verdun only one-sixth of the men in a battalion were to be in the front trenches at one time. This meant that the majority of soldiers were in support roles, in secondary trenches, or working—digging trenches or latrines, or filling sandbags.<br>
<br>
<b>(p.50)</b> But <i>repos</i> was infrequently depicted in terms of hardship: a cartoon in <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (no. 22, 5 September 1917) shows <i>repos</i> to be a time of comradeship and relaxation. A batch, exercise, and hot foot comprise this vision of <i>repos</i>; it is a time for men to take walks together, smoke their pipes, and visit with one another. After a mid-day nap, they gather to hear a concert. At times like these, men got to know each other, and younger soldiers learned of the other soldiers’ experiences. And <i>au repos</i> offered time for the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s favorite hobby: drinking <i>pinard</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-24">[24]</a> <i>L’Esprit du Cor</i> (no. 12, 12 January 1918) shows a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> running through mortar fire, risking his life to bring back <i>pinard</i> and tobacco for his comrades. <i>Pinard</i>’s effects were well documented: <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (no. 14, 20 October 1916) records “the influence of <i>pinard</i> on the <b>(p.51)</b><i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s morale” with amusing pictures. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> beings depressed, in the dumps. But after a quart of <i>pinard</i>, he is a pacifist; after two, an optimist. Three quarts make him bellicose. After four, he can hardly walk, rendered a “neutralist” by the alcohol. After his “Nth” quart, his face is buried in the mud; he vomits as another <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> drags him away. Here, <i>pinard</i> helps the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, first, to express a variety of attitudes towards the war, and, finally, to depart the war altogether, if only in a stupor which lasts a few hours. Just a few quarts of <i>pinard</i> are not enough: after three, he is still bellicose, and after four, he still has a stance on the war, even if it is neutral. It is only after his “Nth,” when his face is buried in the mud, that he is free of all thought.<br>
<br>
Along with the pleasures of free time, the hardships of trench conditions was a central trench cartoon theme. For example, playful cartoons of rats and lice portray the vermin less as foul threats to the soldier’s health than as trenchmates. <i>Le Gafouilleur</i> (no. 21, 15 February 1917) published a poem called “Homage to Rats” with frolicsome rats dancing around the edges of the page. In another cartoon (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-47">Figure 7</a>), lice go on strike, presenting General Joffre with a “Petition for the well-being of Lice.” (<i>Le Bataillon</i>, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-105">no. 69, 24 November 1916</a>) The lice demand that the army “leave the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>’ hair alone, so that we don’t suffer from the cold of the coming season.” However humble, these <i>poux</i> are patriots, as one louse chastises another for wearing the despised iron cross. These cartoons confronted the frustrations <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> must have felt living with vermin: such filth caused insecurity among soldiers from a society in which soap was increasingly becoming the “yardstick of civilization.”<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-25">[25]</a><br>
<br>
Cartoonists also often depicted the fear of mutilation in humorous and often strikingly frank terms. One particularly blunt cartoon from <i>Le Front</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-106">no. 8, 16 October 1916</a>) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-48">Figure 8</a>) portrays a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> having both his legs amputated. The soldier, who is sitting up, watching his leg be sawn off, is asked by the doctor, “Am I hurting you at all?” The “true <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>” responds, “No, sir, it’s just that the sound of the saw sets my teeth on edge.” The gratuitous carnage in this cartoon, such as a leg protruding from a bucket by the table, mocks the false image of the stoic soldier who knows no pain. Another cartoon reveals the fear of returning home maimed: a handless, legless man says to a woman, “Yes madam, I had the honor of fighting, and the luck of returning home. Another cartoon expresses the anxiety of losing one’s sexual appeal when seriously wounded: a man who is missing both arms and legs, and who has a lurid look in his eye, says to a passing girl, “And since I am more than a trunk . . . <i>censored</i>.” He is naked except for a phallic-shaped leaf over his genitals. The caption reads, “The Future of the French soldier.”<br>
<br>
Cartoons which focused on <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> life at the front offer a stark contrast to those which portrayed the enemy in often propaganda-like ways. Trench cartoons defined <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> as members of an inclusive group of white French men forced to live in harsh <b>(p.52)</b> conditions at the front. References to the enemy and non-French, non-white allies depicted <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> in opposition to savagery and stupidity. But it is through the depiction of communal activities that cartoons reveal the more complex, even contradictory attitudes and anxieties of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. While cartoons dealing with the enemy did not deny the importance and moral respectability of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, cartoons about the difficulties of trench life inherently rejected any suggestion that the task of the soldier was an enviable one. In fact, they at times defiantly asserted the devastating consequences of honor and duty. Images of vermin and mutilation, though both amusing and disturbing, can be interpreted as responses to the playful and carefree <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> of homefront publications. But trench cartoons were not defeatist. Through humour, cartoons reinforced the belief that trench conditions could be survived by ridiculing, and even laughing at rats, lice, fatigue, and mutilation. What emerged from these cartoons was a set of sensibilities, more complex than and potentially subversive to the simplified conception of the front found in national propaganda.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>[4.3] <i>Embusqués</i>: Men Outside the Trench Community</b><br>
<br>
The attitudes and sensibilities of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> community were delineated in cartoons about trench life. Yet the limits of the boundaries of this trench community <b>(p.53)</b> were more fully distinguished by references to frenchmen outside it. Trench cartoons scorned French men who were perceived by <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> to have shirked their responsibility to the nation by not fighting. These cowards were deemed <i>embusqués</i>. During the Great War, <i>embusqué</i> meant anyone who, in the eyes of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, had a good post, a safe job. As François Déchelette suggests in his dictionary of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> slang, an <i>embusqué</i> could have included just about anyone, depending on who made the accusation. The the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> in a heavily shelled area, a soldier in a less dangerous area might have been called <i>embusqué</i>.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-26">[26]</a> Cartoons depicting <i>embusqués</i>, therefore, were morally weighted, assigning values corresponding to men’s involvement in the war effort. For example, on the cover of <i>Le Mouchoir</i> (no. 27, 28 May 1916) two <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> watch as a sophisticated, higher-ranking soldier walks by with a woman on his arm. One <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> says to the other, pointing to the passing soldier’s decorations: “My stripes [for continued service]? . . . There they are.” The implication of this cartoon is that this soldier has not earned his promotion, though he enjoys the benefits of his status (women in cartoons are invariably attracted to higher ranking men). To these <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, whose tattered uniforms show the hardship they have experienced, the soldier with the woman is an <i>embusqué</i>. The suggestion here is that his rank affords him greater access to the comfort of the homefront, as well as greater protection from the dangers of battle. Another cartoon contrasts raining shells at the front with an officer’s fear of getting wet in the rain on the homefront. Holding out his hand to feel the drizzle, the officer says to a woman on his arm, “Yes, my dear, it’s awful when it rains.” (<i>Le 3ème Bataillon</i>, no. 24, 12 November 1915) In <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-102">no. 16, 1 January 1917</a>) an officer <i>embusqué</i> was defined in a cartoon “in which we see the life of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> and that of the <i>embusqué</i>.” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-49">Figure 9</a>) Stark contrasts are drawn between the activities of daily life: the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> awakes in a flooded trench, while the officer is brought coffee to his warm bed; the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> gnaws on a bone to the sound of exploding shells, while the officer eats in a restaurant entertained with music: “Le spectacle” means look-out for the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, but a night at the theater for the <i>embusqué</i>. During “l’offensive,” the soldier disembowels the enemy, while the city-dweller grabs a waitress from behind. Rank alone certainly did not denote one’s status as an <i>embusqué</i>. The stripes that each of these <i>embusqués</i> wears were also found adorning the sleeves of many <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> in trench cartoons.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-27">[27]</a> But rank in these particular cartoons was depicted in terms of a class difference as well. The <i>embusqué</i> in <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> possesses the standard visual elements of the French <i>haute bourgeois</i> typology: he is well-dressed and groomed, has a prominent profile, even a monocle. His tastes are sophisticated: violin music with dinner, then a night out at the the theater. He eventually hunts down the traditional object of many a bourgeois fantasy: a barmaid.<br>
<br>
Class distinctions were also prevalent in representations of the most hated <i>embusqué</i>: the wealthy, secure civilian. In trench cartoons, this <i>embusqué</i> epitomized ignorance, laziness, and cowardice. The <i>embusqué</i>’s life was one comfort and self-<b>(p.54)</b>satisfaction; he seduced women and enjoyed the luxuries of well-to-do civilian life, while others defended him and his home. A portrait of the <i>embusqué</i> in <i>Le Bochofage</i> (no. 5, 25 December 1916) has plump man sitting in a comfortable chair, his feet propped up, in front of a fire. He smokes a cigar, a glass of brandy and cup of coffee beside him. The <i>embusqué</i>’s attitude concerning the war was summed up in a cartoon in <i>Poil de Tranchée</i> (no. 2, December (n.d.)) which illustrates the “Proverb of the Embuscade” as “better to hold than to take.” One picture depicts the <i>embusqué</i> literally holding on to what he enjoys—a cozy life; while another shows a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> crossing No Man’s Land, taking an enemy trench. If the <i>embusqué</i> does follow the war, he remains <b>(p.55)</b> oblivious to the irony of his own opulence. One fat civilian sits in front of the fire reading the paper, exclaiming, “These German pigs who are too lazy to go into battle!” (<i>Le Canard du Boyau</i>, no. 12, March 1917) In <i>L’Image</i> (no. 21, 1917), “Our good civilians” are represented as a well-to-do couple. The woman, dressed for an evening out, asks her husband, “Are you coming, my love?” He answers, gazing at his map, “Impossible. I’m studying our latest offensive.”<br>
<br>
Another way of lampooning civilian ignorance of trench conditions is the cartoon about civilian visits to the trenches. A cartoon in <i>Le Front</i> records “une visite” by a terrified <i>embusqué</i> to the front line, and his continued misunderstanding of the war experience even after witnessing it first hand. (no. 1, 1 July 1916) In this cartoon, the civilian arrives dressed in a top hat and long coat. Although he seems afraid of the two <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> who greet him, he notes, “I was received in charming fashion.” He then “admired the fine work of our soldiers,” not realizing the men were digging a latrine. When in the trenches, he puts on his gas mask because he “smelled deadly gas.” In fact, around the corner behind him, a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> is defecating. Having skipped dinner, the <i>embusqué</i> concludes, “the food was delicious,” even though a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> behind him is pulling dead rat from his tin cup. The cartoon directly derides both “eye-wash” and the general misapprehension of civilians in two ways. First, the reporter who visits the trench refuses to report accurately the misery of trench conditions. But also, he clearly expects to find conditions at the front worse than they are, as is clear from his preparedness to witness a gas attack. Two other cartoons in <i>Brise d’Entonnoirs</i> (no. 8, February 1917) and <i>Le Bataillon</i> (no. 54, 28 July 1916) portray civilians paying admission to see the trenches after the war. The curious civilians come dressed ready for a Sunday promenade. What they find, however, is not a pleasant walk in the park. One man, having climbed into a bunker, runs out screaming, rats nipping at his feet and lice dancing in his hair. Women in elaborate hats and dresses try to run away, though they only sink in the deep mud. A few wise <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> watch, amused. In these cartoons, a clear subtext was the knowledge of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> community and power derived from it: not only did soldiers comprehend the details of trench life, they were also well aware of civilian attitudes toward the war. This always placed the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> in a position to laugh at, mock, or sit in judgement of civilians.<br>
<br>
Civilian ambivalence to the war effort was a source of strong resentment for the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. In a series of cartoons in three issues of <i> Le Bataillon</i>, the tribulations of trench life are contrasted with the relative comforts of home. In the first issue (no. 62, 29 September 1916), there appeared a drawing of fashionable looking men and women sitting around a table in a café. In the smoke that billows up from their cigarettes is the image of the trenches, suggesting that their concern for the war is transparent and fleeting. The same issue compared the bombshells of the battlefield with the “bombshells” of the street, in this case a woman flamboyantly dressed. In two <b>(p.56)</b> following issues, cartoons depicted the passing of the four seasons at both the front and the rear. (no. 63, 6 October 1916, no. 64, 20 October 1916). Spring in the city is a time for a man and a woman to meet and fall in love. Summer afternoons bring crowds to outdoor cafes. In the autumn, a couple walks together as leaves fall. And in the winter, a man complains that he can’t get his feet warm in front of the fire. The romance and idleness of the year on the homefront makes a striking counterpoint to the year at the front: springtime brings a “Dear John” letter; summertime finds him taking a drink during heavy shelling; while the leaves fall at home, more shells fall at the front. By winter, his clothes are tattered, he stands knee-deep in water, shivering over a candle. Dead rats float by. As a final insult to the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, when the armistice was announced, the <i>embusqué</i> was the first to congratulate himself: for example, one plump character says to his wife, “Finally dear, WE won the war!” (<i>Le Bochofage</i>, Noel, 1918) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-50">Figure 10</a>)<br>
<br>
If indeed there were an “enemy to the rear” in the mind of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, cartoons suggest that it was the villainous wealthy <i>embusqué</i>: he represented weakness, fear, incompetence. One cartoon depicted this weakness in a simple caricature of a large dog chasing a small, aristocratic-looking pure breed, saying “Get out, <i>embusqué</i>!” (<i>L’Echo des Marmites</i>, no. 10, 25 April 1916) This <i>embusqué</i> was a foil against which the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was defined as a common man, who understood duty, served the nation, and resigned himself to self-sacrifice. In this sense, cartoons of the civilian <i>embusqué</i> generally critiqued the frivolous ways of the homefront, while they also defined the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> as admirable, morally superior. The civilian <i>embusqué</i> presented in trench cartoons represented wealth and comfort: he is the civil servant, the politician’s son who stays behind, letting others do the dirty work. There were indeed many men like this. But there were also men who were taken from the trenches to perform essential tasks, such as skilled workers who assembled armaments for the war effort. They, too, were certainly <i>embusqués</i> by definition.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-28">[28]</a> But the image of the working-class life did not offer the details trench cartoonists sought when depicitng the homefront. Soldiers despised the wealthy <i>embusqué</i> for having access to what they could only dream of: women, entertainment, a home, comfort—the symbols of civilization.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.4] The Elusive Woman: Object of <i>Poilu</i> Dreams, Source of Frustration</b><br>
<br>
Even though cartoons about the <i>embusqué</i> described the frustrations associated with trench life and the inequities of military service, they alone did not offer a complete picture of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> attitudes toward the homefront. Other apsects of the homefront were central to <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> morale at the front. As a cartoon from <i>Poil et Plume</i> (no. 13, August 1918) points out, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s “goals of war” were to receive letters and, better still, packages sent from home. And the best goal of all to win was <i>la perme</i> <b>(p.57)</b> (leave to go home). Mail was so revered by <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> that the “blessed mailman” is eternalized in stained glass in the “Church of the front” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-51">Figure 11</a>) in a cartoon from <i>Le Ver Luisant</i> (no. 13, November 1916). The bearded, saint-like <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> wears a long gown and showers letters and packages upon soldiers, sowing happiness throughout the trenches. When no mail arrived for the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, memories of the homefront penetrated his dreams. One cartoon from <i>Le Petit Echo du 18e Territorial</i> (no. 81, 28 May 1916) contrasts trench realities with fantasies about home: rats sniff around a napping <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s head, but in his dreams he sees beautiful dancers; as a cloud of mustard gas wafts into the trenches, he imagines the intoxicating smells of a home-cooked meal; he feels himself curled in a feather bed, not the hard cot on which he sleeps; and instead of the stench of latrines, he smells imaginary flowers. This cartoon works by contrasting the debilitating hardships of trench life—rats, gas, harsh living conditions—with the mundane comforts of homefront, such as hot food, a bed, flowers, But it also reveals the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s tenacity to keep the homefront in his thoughts, even under the most trying circumstances. <br>
<br>
Perhaps better than any other, cartoons about women reveal the complexities of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s perception of the war and the homefront. In a cartoon in <i>Le Canard Dieppois</i> <b>(p.58)</b> (no. 19, 20 Nov. 1916), the conquest of women is as central to the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s war aims as the defeat of the enemy. A <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> and a woman are in bed together, their clothes strewn on the floor beside them, as if in hurried passion. The woman assures the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>: “Don’t worry, <i>on les aura</i>.” Here, the French soldier’s battle cry <i>On les aura!</i> (”We will have them!”) is used in an erotic context, referring not to territorial conquests, but to sexual ones, as the patient woman responds to the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s quick advances. Another cartoon renders “Two good moments” in a soldier’s career: running <b>(p.59)</b> a German through with a bayonet, and kissing a woman. (<i>Poil et Plume</i>, no. 3, August 1916) The shift from attacking the enemy to pursuing women is not always as easy as these cartoons suggest, however, and some cartoons express this disappointment explicitly. For example, a cartoon in <i>Le 3ème Bataillon</i> (no. 36, 11 February 1916) shows how two <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’ judgment has been affected by the war. While walking in town, the two <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> fresh from the front see two well-dressed women. They excitedly invite the ladies to meet them that evening. “We’ll be here at 8 o’clock,” the women respond. But the scheduled rendez-vous reveals that these beautiful dates are not what they appeared: having changed clothes, the “ladies” are in fact two scruffy soldiers themselves. Intense sexual pangs had got the best of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>’ discretion: so excited were they to see someone in a dress, they failed to realize the true gender of their dates. Shocked and appalled by their mistake, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> hastily retreat.<br>
<br>
Leave from the trenches allowed <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> to return to the “civilized” world where they could sleep soundly, spend time in cafes, and, most importantly of all, interact with women. In a provocative, sexualized representation of “<i>la perm</i>” in <i>Rigol Boche</i> (no. 17, 20 July 1915), Cupid, dressed as a mail-boy, delivers to a beautiful young woman news of her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s homecoming. The woman stands in front of a mirror and small table where bottles of perfume are neatly arranged. Her hand is posed behind her head, accentuating the curves of her body beneath her thin negligee. The bed behind her, draped in a canopy with stacks of pillows and a thick comforter, is an inviting retreat. The woman seems at ease, spending idle hours pampering herself in front of a mirror. Who is this woman who spends her days half-naked? A wife, lover, prostitute? She is a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> fantasy, an idealized vision of the civilian life. What is perhaps most striking about this cartoon is that her comforts are in many ways the gendered equivalents to the cigar, the armchair and the brandy of the <i>embusqué</i>. But in this cartoon, there is not a hint of irony or of scorn for this innocent beauty. She lives in a world of delicacy, comfort, solitude, amongst small bottles of perfume, and the haven of her bed. But her close association with luxury is sexually coded, and the presumed recipient of her sexual favors is a distant, but not forgotten <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. She is not only beautiful and alluring, but most important she remains faithful; she exists to pamper and satisfy, and her attention is exclusively reserved for her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. Rather than resented, her cherished company as well as her dedication to her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> at the front made her the most revered symbol in the trenches.<br>
<br>
This symbolic woman was, however, rarely accessible to the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, and many jokes were wrought from soldiers’ fantasies ending in disaster or frustration. A common joke referred to the <i>marraines</i>, or “god-mothers”—women who agreed to be pen-pals with soldiers at the front. The <i>marraine</i> was frequently the object of men’s fantasies: the distant woman inevitable took on seductive characteristics in the mind of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. One cartoon exposes these fantasies by portraying a number of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> who, while on leave, have a chance to meet their <i>marraines</i>. In one scene, a soldier anxious <b>(p.60)</b> to meet his lovely pen-pal asks a wrinkled, elderly woman, “Miss Laura won’t be long?” Confused, the woman responds, “But I am Laura, my dear god-son.” Another <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> who has brought a bouquet of flowers for his date, is introduced to a small girl and told: “This is Miss Lulu.” In a third scene, a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> yells “But you misled me!” to a large, caricatured African woman. “Pardon me, my heroic boy,” she replies, “I told you I had dark features, <i>very </i> dark.” [”<i>pardon, cher héroique filleul, je vous avez bien dit que j’étais brune, très brune</i>.”] But this cartoon is not without its serious side: in the center of these drawings, is a young nurse standing beside a body-bag saying, “There’s one I’ll never get to visit.” Anxieties over never returning, or being irreparably changed were often undercurrents in cartoons depicting the return to women and family.<br>
<br>
Women’s ignorance of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s war experience was also recognized in cartoons, but often with an ambiguous moral message. While women often symbolize sexuality and the comforts of home life, they also could represent frivolity, as well as ignorance of trench conditions. For example, in a cartoon entitled “What one hears on leave,” a fashionable woman asks with a coy smile, “Where do you do your daily duty in the trenches?” (<i>Le Bochofage</i>, no. 8, 26 March 1917). Another portrays the meeting between a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> and his <i>marraine</i>, who complains, “My god-son, I think you gave me a <i>toto</i>!” (<i>toto</i> being a trench-slang word for lice). The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> sarcastically replies, “Dear Marraine, it is all I have, and I give it to you gladly.” This intersection of woman’s allure and <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>’s filth also appears in a cartoon from <i>Le Front</i> (no. 3, 1 August 1916) where three well-dressed women stand with bags and boxes labeled “Fashions” in their hands, bragging about their boyfriends at the front:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>—Mine’s an aviator.<br>
—My poor boy is in an invaded region.<br>
—Which region is that?<br>
—I don’t know. He just said, “I’ve been invaded by <i>Totos</i>.”</blockquote><br>
<br>
Cartoons such as this demonstrate women’s inability to comprehend even the more mundane aspects of trench life, and are another example of soldiers’ concern about the degeneration of their personal habits and hygiene.<br>
<br>
But trench cartoons did not lampoon even ignorant women with the same harshness as the male <i>embusqué</i>. In fact, some cartoons portray women’s misunderstanding of trench life more as innocence or even endearing naivete than ignorance or indifference. One woman, in a tearful good-bye at the train station, tells her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>: “And be sure not to sit in any cold drafts.” (<i>Le Front</i>, no. 14, 16 January 1917) Though this cartoon is certainly not without its irony, the somber atmosphere of this departure scene softens the antagonism which might otherwise be associated with such a misplaced comment. In a similar scene, a man offers consolation: “Don’t worry yourself, my love, when I am in Grélines, I will write you long letters.” (<i>Le Canard du Boyau</i>, no. 10, December 1916) Though this borders the maudlin, it suggests like <b>(p.61)</b> the previous cartoon, that sheltering women from the war could be an honorable pursuit. The act of sheltering itself even became a subject to distort for comic results. Another cartoon from <i>Le Canard du Boyau</i> shows how downplaying the danger of the war can win women’s attention, if not affection. At a bar, a brave <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> surrounded by young admirers describes his tour at the front with calculated nonchalance: “Sure, there are lots of mines and bombs, it’s true, but you get used to it.” (no. 10, December 1916)<br>
<br>
After the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> himself, women were the most complex characters in trench cartoons, inhabiting an ambiguous space in the geography of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s imagination. On the one hand, they represented the antithesis of the war: they were beautiful and alluring, refined and gentle. This image of the woman, with her perfume-bottle delicacy, was far removed from the world of rats, lice and shells; they were out of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s reach, both literally and figuratively. She was the symbol of the homefront—a distant place accessible only through letters, packages and the too infrequent leave. But in another sense, women were also constantly <i>with</i> the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, especially in fantasies and dreams. The miseries of trench life did not extinguish the image of the woman from the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s mind. Rather, throughout the war, she remained a symbol central to the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s self-definition and his assessment of the psychological impact of the war. Her centrality meant she often reflected a variety of soldiers’ anxieties. Women who failed to understand the rigors of the trench experience were a source of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> frustration; although the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> did not expect her, and in many case, did not want her to comprehend it. For trench cartoons suggest that soldiers judged a woman’s moral value not by her active support of the war effort—for example, in her role as a munitions worker. Rather, <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s judged a woman on how faithful and dedicated, that is, how close in mind if not in body, she remained to her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>.<br>
<br>
<b>[4.5] The View from the Trenches: An Enemy to the Rear?</b><br>
<br>
A number of cultural historians have argued that the “us <i>versus</i> them” mentality of battle led soldiers in the Great War to understand the conflict as a series of gross dichotomies, such as army <i>versus</i> army, trenches <i>versus</i> homefront. Further, the ineptitude of military officials and the callous indifference of the civilian population drove soldiers to imagine “an enemy to the rear.” Some historians have also argued that soldiers conceptualized the front and homefront in terms of gendered zones: the front represented a male world, the homefront, a female one.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-29">[29]</a> In the French case, where soldiers fought on their own soil for the duration of the war, a strict dichotomy is difficult to imagine. Unlike British or German troops, for many Frenchmen, the homefront was within walking distance of the front lines; and considering the extent to which the German army advanced into France at the start of the war, for some French soldiers, “home” was in fact behind enemy lines. Trench cartoons <b>(p.62)</b> reveal the complexities and contradictions of the physical and symbolic relation between the French front line and the homefront during the Great War. Rather than solidify the dichotomy of trench and homefront, these cartoons depicted overlapping systems of interaction—both real and imagined—between the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> and his home.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-30">[30]</a> Though cartoons did define the enemy as a menacing, murderous force, they portrayed the homefront with far more subtlety and ambiguity. The community of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> was often closed, especially to the likes of <i>embusqués</i> and non-white colonial troops. But the life of the soldier that emerges in trench cartoons is not one easily associated with dichotomies. Life int he trenches was neither one of undying dedication and heroism, as propaganda often insisted, nor one of unending physical misery and social isolation. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was familiar with a variety of occupations and pastimes, from combat to digging latrines, and from playing games to getting drunk on cheap wine. Cartoons also often blurred the physical barriers between home and front. Cartoons often portrayed the daily interactions of soldiers with the civilian life just behind the lines: one <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> buying tobacco from a shopkeeper, another waving to girls on a passing train. And soldiers always celebrated the tangible evidence of more distant homes, such as mail, packages, and especially going on leave. The visual element of cartoons also made them particularly effective at recreating <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s imaginary world where front and homefront often mingled: in dreams and fantasies, the smells, sounds, and sensations of home lived in the trenches. The pain and monotony of combat made even the simplest comforts of home more real and more cherished than before the war.<br>
<br>
Trench cartoons also reveal a distinct moral code, though not one based on clear dichotomies. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> did value <i>l’impôt du sang</i>—the blood tax paid by a citizen to his country—above all else. Here, the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> was held in the highest regard as he sacrificed everything for the benefit of his countrymen. This was depicted primarily through the use of the enemy foil: against the barbaric and blood-thirsty or stupid and misguided pictures of the enemy, the honorable <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> shined as smart, efficient, and honorable. Yet cartoons suggest that <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a> mentalité</i> was more complex than this <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> ideal. these <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> thirsted for hot coffee more than glory, and enjoyed a leisurely day of rest more than honor. These soldiers, who drank <i>pinard</i> whenever they got the chance, who longed for news from loved-ones, and who fantasized about being home, subverted the military ideal of an effective soldier. But <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, even in cartoons, did not hesitate to acknowledge the importance of their position in the war. A cartoon from <i>La Musette</i> (25 February 1918) illustrates the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s moral vision of the war in terms of distance from combat. The <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, who lives and fights at the front, is deemed a “good” man; the officer, who works at the back of the front, is of “medium” character; and the <i>embusqué</i> who hides in the rear is not worth recognizing. A similar, though more complicated hierarchy instructed <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> attitudes toward women. The woman on the homefront who stayed close to her <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>—wrote <b>(p.63)</b> him, sent packages, waited for his visit—was the symbol of fidelity and allure, despite her physical distance from or ignorance of the war. The self-interested woman obsessed with fashion, who spent time the <i>embusqué</i>, and remained generally unconcerned with the war, was less admitted by the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. But she still was never as despised as the male <i>embusqué</i>, and in some instances her naive ideas possessed an endearing quality.<br>
<br>
The argument that soldiers saw an “enemy to the rear” raises another question about the motivation of troops in the trenches: what motivated <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> to continue fighting a long and devastating war for a homefront which appeared unconcerned with their sacrifices? Official propaganda and the <i>bourrage de crâne</i> published in national newspapers angered and further alienated soldiers. Rumors of civilian frivolity spread through the trenches, feeding <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> resentment. In order to reconcile this view of the homefront with questions of motivation, historical explanations of soldiers’ continued willingness to fight ultimately steer away from analysis of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s daily experiences. Some historians have suggested that ideals such as patriotism, <i>devoir</i> (duty), dedication to one’s fellow soldiers, and an irresistible “national feeling” created a psychological barrier in the soldier’s mind that made it impossible for him to give up.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-31">[31]</a> But this reliance on ideological influences shifts the discussion away from the war experience itself, towards the development of what must have been a tenacious national resolve across France in the pre-war period. There remains the issue of <i>how</i> soldiers from day to day reconciled a love of nation and countrymen with a resentment of the homefront and the civilian population over the devastating course of the war. <br>
<br>
Although cartoons do not provide a complete answer to these questions, they do suggest at least one way in which soldiers made sense of the war experience and motivated themselves to continue their efforts. Cartoons, with their use of subversion and contradiction for comic effect, were a particularly effective medium for expressing and reconciling the complexities of <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> attitudes toward the homefront. The attempt to resolve the disdain for certain members of the homefront with the appeal of the comforts of home is most apparent in cartoons dealing with the <i>embusqué</i>. Though the most resented symbol of the homefront in trench cartoons, the <i>embusqué</i> led a life of east that was, importantly, the life most <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> dreamt of for themselves. In the language of trench cartoons, civilian was not symbolized by tricolor flags, the French cock, and a female <i>Liberté</i>, but by cafes, bottles of wine, and well-dressed women. These mundane images were common symbols of the nation in the trenches, signposts of the “civilized” life behind the front that the war was meant to protect. A cartoon from <i>Face aux Boches Illustré</i> (no. 16, February 1917) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-52">Figure 12</a>) depicts this relation of civilization to the front nicely. The distance furthest from the trenches—that is, the place where the <i>embusqué</i> hid in a life of luxury—was not only the safest, but also the most attractive, fashionable, civilized. As one nears the front  <b>(p.64)</b> one passes back through time, where mules and horses dragged wagons through mud roads. The line of trees on the city street is replaced with charred stumps 10 kilometers from the front. Just a kilometer from the fighting, the landscape is bare, beaten by shells. Does this cartoon simply sneer at the easy life of the city-dweller? A similar cartoon from <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-103">no. 18, 10 March 1917</a>), called “The Return of the Warrior, or the joys of a day on leave” (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-53">Figure 13</a>), suggests not. This cartoon presented a clear view of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> perception of a perfect day on leave: the beautiful family, a hot bath, good food and wine, conversation with friends, a soft bed, a night of love. These were symbols that appeared often in <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> fantasy cartoons. Yet all of these images were also used to describe the life of the <i>embusqué</i>. The important difference is that, in this cartoon, the main character is a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>, and as a result the tone of the cartoon is positive. In this sense, the <i>embusqué</i>—who was almost always represented in cartoons as wealthy and comfortable—was as much a symbol of the pleasures of civilization as the fantasy woman of “<i>la perme</i>” with her canopy bed and perfume bottles. While many cartoons jeered the figure of the <i>embusqué</i> as cowardly and weak, his character also <b>(p.65)</b> helped give shape to a <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> view of the war which revered the lifestyle enjoyed by those behind the trenches.<br>
<br>

Trench cartoons, therefore, reveal two separate, and sometimes contradictory attitudes of the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>. On the one hand, they provided moral values. Within this theme, French soldiers were the most virtuous of all. They were as incomparable to the buffoonery and butchery of the enemy as to the cowardice and comfort of the French civilian. The consumption of wine and cigars by the <i>embusqué</i> was an indication of his decadence in a time of national sacrifice. But cartoons also had a far more <b>(p.66)</b>  practical function: they served as simple reminders of what <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> were fighting for—the comforts of civilian life. Rather than draw on the symbolic language of duty, honor, and <i>la patrie</i> found in national propaganda, trench cartoons drew on a repertoire of images closer to the average <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s own interests. Ironically, the comforts cherished by the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> were veritably identical to the indulgences of the resented <i>embusqué</i>. Furniture, warm fires, coffee, liquor, a lover, trips to the cafe, a good smoke, such were the symbols of “civilization” which contrasted sharply with the  <b>(p.67)</b> deprivations of trench life.<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-32">[32]</a> The French <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s perception of the geography of the war, apparent in cartoons, was not founded on gross dichotomies, but on varying distances. The home front and the trenches were not separated by a No Man’s Land, but rather a perceived space of complex moral values. Ultimately, as cartoon in <i>L’Echo des Marmites</i> (no. 23, 20 October 1917) (<a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-54">Figure 14</a>) shows, the front and the rear were connected as one nation engaged in war. The detail of this cartoon, moving from the table tables of the city to the explosions of the battlefield, reveals the <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>’s understanding of the varied terrain between themselves and the ideal homefront.<br>
<br>
Trench cartoons perpetuated an image of moral pride for <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i>, and continually reminded <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> of their role as defenders of France. This does not mean that cartoons were the sole motivating factor which kept men in the trenches of the Great War. Trench cartoons do suggest, however, that <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> found their own ways of encouraging and motivating themselves. <i>Poilus</i> might have withstood the detrimental experiences of the trenches, not simply with patriotism or a sense of <i>devoir</i>, but by joking together about the ignorance of the homefront, sharing <i>pinard</i>, jeering the <i>embusqué</i>, or by dreaming of the simple comforts of the home life they left behind. This helps explain the popularity of a number of cultural products created within the trench community, such as songs, newspapers, stories, and cartoons. Rather than simple distractions, these were means of expression which enabled soldiers to define and understand their roles and anxieties in an alien and dangerous environment where preexisting cultural references no longer worked. The trench cartoon, with humor, satire and ridicule at its base, was a perfect cultural medium to represent a range of contradictory <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i> attitudes. By transforming tragedy into a harmless caricature, and emotional devastation into a quick laugh, the cartoon helped <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> make sense of the indescribable destruction of the war around them. <br>

Trench papers were generally encouraged, as is indicated by an 8 March 1916 circular from General Joffre, because they attempted to boost morale. Official censorship was enforced, though sporadically; self-censorship within newspaper staffs was more likley, as editors used their best judgement in deciding what was inappropriate to print. Similarly, though many articles targeted official “eyewash,” trench papers were not totally free of propaganda. See Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, 20-33. Further, with trench journalism, as with memoirs and diaries, there remain questions of authorship and authenticity. For instance, were those writers who rendered the most vivid description of life at the front truly representative of the average <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a></i>?<br>
<br>
9. The analysis of trench cartoons in this paper is based on a survey of approximately 75 trench papers in the Hoover Institute Library at Stanford University. Audoin-Rouzeau estimates that about 400 trench papers were published by French forces between 1914 and 1918, of which approximately half survive. Audoin-Rouzeau, <i>Men at War</i>, 8.<br>

11. For example, Leonard Smith notes that “after a month of nearly constant maneuver and combat, the 5e DI took part in a total of only thirty-five days of pitched battles over the next seventeen months of the war, primarily in two attacks at Neuville-St. Vaast in the spring and fall of 1915.” <i>Between Mutiny and Obedience</i>, 74.<br>

13. It is interesting that moral character was so central to cartoons considering that French moral superiority to the enemy was perhaps the most common theme in printed official propaganda. See Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, “’Bourrage de Crâne’ et Information en France en 1914-1918,” in Jean-Jacques Becker and S.

22. Englander, “The French Soldier,” 57. French soldiers feared the presence of English and American soldiers for the same reasons. One cartoon explicitly represents the perceived sexual conquest of the English. In <i>Le Tord-Boyau</i> (no. 16, December 1917), a French woman is asked by military authorities if the English left anything behind. “Yes, sir, this!” she says, holding up a baby. It is interesting to note that while <i><a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-200">poilu</a>s</i> feared the allies impregnating French women, a heated debate was taking place on the homefront over what to do with “children of the enemy”—babies born as a result of alleged German rape.

24. A Private Legentil, Class of 1916, described in his diary the socializing between soldiers during periods out of the trenches: “We got to know the old-timers of the section, who were quite few, having left many comrades on the slopes of the fort of Douaumont.” These old-timers, Legentil says, spent much of their free time getting drunk.

But they remained the symbols of French civilization.
