From <i>Obasan</i>
<p>
February 15, 1942
Dearest Nesan,
	I thought I would write to you every day but, as you see, I haven’t managed that. I felt so sad thinking about what the children are having to experience I didn’t want to keep writing. But today I must tell you what’s happening. 
	Things are changing so fast. First, all the Japanese men-the ones who were born in Japan and haven’t been able to get their citizenship yet-are being rounded up, one hundred or so at a time. A few days ago, Mark told me he felt sure Sam had been carted off. I took the interurban down as soon as I could. Isamu couldn’t have been gone too long because not all the plants were parched though some of the delicate ones had turned to skeletons in the front window. I tried to find the dog but she’s just nowhere. I looked and called all through the woods and behind the house.
	Grandma and Grandpa Nakane will be so upset and confused when they find out he’s gone. You know how dependent they are on him. They went to Salt-spring Island a couple of weeks ago and haven’t come back yet. I know they’re with friends so they must be all right. 
	We know some people who have left Vancouver. Dad says we should look around and get out too, but we just don’t know any other place. When we look at the map it’s har5d to think about all those unknown places. We were thinking of going to Kamloops, but that may be too close to the boundary of the “protected area.” 
	It’s becoming frightening here, with the agitation mounting higher. It isn’t just a matter of fear of sabotage or military necessity any more, it’s outright race persecution. Groups like the “Sons of Canada” are petitioning Ottawa against us and the newspapers are printing outright lies. There was a picture of a young Nisei boy with a metal lunch box and it said he was a spy with a radio transmitter. When the reporting was protested the error was admitted in a tiny line in the classified section at the back where you couldn’t see it unless you looked very hard.
</p>
<p>
March 2, 1942.
	Everyone is so distressed here, Nesan. Eiko and Fumi came over this morning, crying. All student nurses have been fired from the General.
	Our beautiful radios are gone. We had to give them up or suffer the humiliation of having them taken forcibly by the RCMP. Our cameras-even Stephen’s toy one that he brought out to show them when they came-all are confiscated. They can search our homes without warrant. 
But the great shock is this: we are all being forced to leave. All of us. Not a single person of the Japanese race who lives in the “protected area” will escape. There is something called a Civilian Labour Corps and Mark and Dan were going to join-you know how they do everything together-but now will not go near it as it smells of a demonic roundabout way of getting rid of us. There is a very suspicious clause “within and <i>without</i>” Canada, that has all the fellows leery.
	Who knows where we will be tomorrow, next week. It isn’t as if we Nisei were aliens-technically or not. It breaks my heart to think of leaving this house and the little things that we’ve gathered through the years-all those irreplaceable mementoes-our books and paintings-the azalea plants, my white iris.
	Oh Nesan, the Nisei are bitter. Too bitter for their own good or for Canada. How can cool heads like Tom’s prevail, when the general feeling is to stand up and fight? He needs all his level-headedness and diplomacy, as editor of the <i>New Canadian</i>, since that’s the only paper left to us now.
	A curfew that applies only to us was started a few days ago. If we’re caught out after sundown, we’re thrown in jail. People who have been fired-and there’s a scramble on to be the first to kick us out of jobs-sit at home without even being able to go out for a consoling cup of coffee. For many, home is just a bed. Kunio is working like mad with the Welfare society to look after the women and children who were left when the men were forced to “volunteer” to go to the work camps. And where are those men? Sitting in unheated bunk-cars, no latrines, no water, snow fifteen feet deep, no work, little food if any. They were shunted off with such inhuman speed that they got there before any facilities were prepared. Now other men are afraid to go because they think they’ll be going to certain disaster. If the snow is that deep, there is no work. If there is no pay, no one eats. Their families suffer. <i>The Daily Province</i> reports that work on frames with tent coverings is progressing to house the 2,000 expected. Tent coverings where the snow is so deep? You should see the faces here-all pinched, gray, uncertain. Signs have been posted on all highways-“Japs Keep Out.”
	Mind you, you can’t compare this sort of thing to anything that happens in Germany. That country is openly totalitarian. But Canada is supposed to be a democracy. 
	All Nisei are liable to imprisonment if we refuse to volunteer to leave. At least that is the likeliest interpretation of Ian MacKenzie’s “Volunteer or else” statement. He’s the Minister of Pensions and National Health. Why do they consider us to be wartime prisoners? Can you wonder that there is a deep bitterness among the Nisei who believed in democracy?
	And the horrors that some of the young girls are facing-outraged by men in uniform. You wouldn’t believe it, Nesan. You have to be right here in the middle of it to really know. The men are afraid to go and leave their wives behind. How can the Hakujin not feel ashamed for their treachery? My butcher told me he knew he could trust me more than he could most whites. But kind people like him are betrayed by the outright racists and whites. But kind people like him are betrayed by the outright racists and opportunists like Alderman Wilson, God damn his soul. And there are others who, although they wouldn’t persecute us, are ignorant and indifferent and believe we’re being very well treated for the “class” of people we are. One letter in the papers says that in order to preserve the “British way of life,” they should send us all away. We’re a “lower order of people.” In one breath we are damned for being “inassimilable” and the next there’s fear that we’ll assimilate. One reporter points to those among us who are living in poverty and says “No British subject would live in such conditions.” Then if we improve out lot, another says “There is danger that they will enter our better neighborhoods.” If we are educated the complaint is that we will cease being the “ideal servant.” It makes me choke. The diseases, the crippling, the twisting of our souls is still to come.
</p>
<p>
March 12.
	Honest Nesan, I’m just in a daze this morning. The last ruling forbids any of us-even Nisei-to go anywhere in this wide dominion without a permit from the Minister of Justice, St. Laurent, through Austin C. Taylor of the Commission here. We go where they send us.
	Northing affects me much just now except rather detachedly. Everything is like a bad dream. I keep telling myself to wake up. There’s no sadness when friends of long standing disappear overnight-either to Camp or somewhere in the Interior. No farewells-no promise at all of future meetings or correspondence-or anything. We just disperse. It’s as if we never existed. We’re hit so many ways at one time that if I wasn’t past feeling I think I would crumble.
	This curfew business is horrible. At sundown we scuttle into our holes like furtive creatures. We look in the papers for the time of next morning’s sunrise when we may venture forth.
	The government has requisitioned the Livestock Building at Hastings Park, and the Women’s Building to house 2,000 “Japs pending removal.” White men are pictured in the newspaper filling ticks with bales of straw for mattresses, putting up makeshift partitions for toilets-etc. Here the lowly Jap will be bedded down like livestock in stalls-perhaps closed around under police guard-I don’t know. The Nisei will be “compelled”(news report) to volunteer in Labor Gangs. The worse the news from the Eastern Front, the more ghoulish the public becomes. We are the billygoats and nannygoats and kids-all the scapegoats to appease this blindness. Is this a Christian country? Do you know that Alderman Wilson, the man who says such damning things about us, has a father who is an Anglican clergyman?
	I can’t imagine how the government is going to clothe and educate our young when they can’t even get started on feeling and housing 22,000 removees. Yet the deadline for clearing us out seems to be July 1st or 31st-I’m not sure which. Seems to me that either there are no fifth columnists or else the Secret Service men can’t find them. If the FBI in the States have rounded up a lot of them you’d think the RCMP could too and let the innocent ones alone. I wish to goodness they’d catch them all. I don’t feel safe if there are any on the loose. But I like to think there aren’t any.

March 20.
Dearest Nesan,
	Stephen has been developing a slight limp. Dad’s not sure what’s wrong with the leg. He suspects that the fall he had last year never healed properly and there’s some new aggravation at the hip. Stephen spends a lot of time making up tunes on the violin Dad got him. The old one, I told you, was broken. It’s lucky our houses are so close as I can get to see the children fairly often, even with the miserable curfew. 
	Your friend Mina Sugimoto takes her boys to play with Stephen a fair amount but she’s acting like a chicken flapping about with her head cut off since her husband left.
	Last night over a hundred boys entrained for a road camp at Schreiber, Ontario. A hundred and fifty are going to another camp at Jasper. The Council (United Nisei) has been working like mad talking to the boys. The first batch of a hundred refused to go. They got arrested and imprisoned in that Immigration building. The next batch refused too and were arrested. Then on Saturday they were released on the promise that they would report back to the Pool. There was every indication they wouldn’t but the Council persuaded them to keep their word. They went finally. That was a tough hurdle and the Commission cabled Ralston to come and do something.
	On Thursday night, the confines in the Hastings Park Pool came down with terrible stomach pains. Ptomaine, I gather. A wholesale company or something is contracted to feed them and there’s profiteering. There are no partitions of any kind whatsoever and the people are treated worse than livestock, which at least had their own pens and special food when they were there. No plumbing of any kind. They can’t take a bat. Thy don’t even take their clothes off. Two weeks now. Lord! Can you imagine a better breeding ground for typhus? They’re cold(Vnacouver has a fuel shortage), they’re undernourished, they’re unwashed. One of the men who came out to buy food said it was pitiful the way the kids scramble for food and the slow ones go empty. God damn those politicians who brought this tragedy on us.
	Dan has to report tomorrow and will most likely be told when to go and where. A day’s notice at most. When will we see him again? Until all this happened I didn’t realize how close a member of the family he had become. He’s just like a brother to me. Nesan, I don’t know what to do.
	The Youth Congress protested at the ill treatment buy since then the daily papers are not printing a word about us. One baby was born at the Park. Premature, I think.
	If all this sounds like a bird’s eye view to you, Nesan, it’s the reportage of a caged bird. I can’t really see what’s happening. We’re like a bunch of rabbits being chased by hounds.
	You remember Mr. Morri, the man who was teaching judo to the RCMP? He receives orders from the Mounties to get “a hundred to the station or else and here’s a list of names.” Any who ware rich enough, or desperate about not going immediately because of family concerns, pay Morii hundreds of dollars and get placed conveniently on a committee. There are nearly two hundred on that “committee” now. Some people say he’s distributing the money to needy families but who knows?
	There’s a three-way split in the community-three general camps: the Morii gang, us-the Council group-and all the rest, who don’t know what to do. The Council group is just a handful. It’s grueling uphill work for us. Some people want to fight. Others say our only chance is to co-operate with the government. Whichever way we decide there’s a terrible feeling of underlying treachery.
</p>
<p>
March 22, 1942
Dear Diary,
	I don’t know if Nesan will ever see any of this. I don’t know anything any more. Things are swiftly getting worse here. Vancouver-the water, the weather, the beauty, this paradise-is filled up and overflowing with hatred now. If we stick around too long we’ll all be chucked into Hastings Park. Fumi and Eiko are heloing the women there and they say the crowding, the noise, the confusion is chaos. Mothers are prostrated in nervous exhaustion-the babies crying endlessly-the fathers torn from them without farewell-everyone crammed into two buildings like so many pigs-children taken out of school with no provision for future education-more and more people pouring into the Park-forbidden to step outside the barbed wire gates and fence-the men can’t even leave the building-police guards around them-some of them fight their way out to come to town and see what they can do about their families. Babies and motherless children totally stranded-their fathers taken to camp. It isn’t as if this place had been bombed and <i>everyone</i> was suffering. <i>Then</i> our morale would be high because we’d be <i>together</i>.
	Eiko says the women are going to be mental cases.
	Rev. Kabayama and family got thrown in too. It’s going to be an ugly fight to survive among us. They’re making (they say) accommodation for 1,200-1,300 women and children in that little Park! Bureaucrats find it so simple on paper and it’s translated willy-nilly into action-and the pure hell that results is kept “hush hush” from the public, who are already kicking about the “luxury” given to Japs.
	I’m consulting with Dad and Mark and Aya bout going to Toronto. WEccould all stay together if we could find someone in Toronto to sponsor us. People are stranded here and there all over the B.C. interior. I want to leave this poisoned province. But Aya wants to stay in B.C. to be closer to Sam. I’m going to write to a doctor in Toronto that Dad knows.
</p>

March27
	Dan’s been arrested. The boys refused to go to Ontario. Both trainloads. So they’re all arrested. Dan had a road map friends drew for him so they suspected him of being a “spy” and now he’s in the Pool.
	Nisei are called “enemy aliens” Minister of War, or Defense, or something flying here to take drastic steps.
</p>
<p>
Dearest Nesan,
	If only you and Mother could come home! Dad’s sick in bed. The long months of steady work. Since the evacuation started he’s had to let-up at all. Two nights ago, one of his patients was dying. He treid to arrange to have the daughter go to the old man’s beside but couldn’t. Dad stayed up all night with the man, and now he’s sick himself.
	I’m afraid that those kept in the Hastings Park will be held as hostages or something. Perhaps to ensure the good behavior of the men in the work camps. Dan was cleared of that idiotic spying charge and is helping at the Pool. The cop who arrested him was drunk and took a few jabs at him but Dan didn’t retaliate, thank heavens. I’m applying for a pass so I can get to see him.
	Dan has a lawyer working for him and his parents about their desire to stay together, especially since Dan’s father is blind and his mother speaks no English at all. The lawyer went to the Security Commission’s lawyers and reported back that he was told to let the matter drift because they were going to make sure the Japs suffered as much as possible. The Commission is responsible to the Federal Government through the Minister of Justice, St. Laurent. It works in conjunction with the RCMP. The Commission has three members-Austin C. Taylor, to represent the Minister of Justice, Commissioner Mead of the RCMP, John Shirras of the Provincial Police.
	Only Tommy and Kunio, as active members of the Council, know what’s going on and they’re too busy to talk to me. The <i>New Canadian</i> comes out so seldom we have no way of knowing much and I’ve been so busy helping Dad I can’t get to Council meetings very often. There’s so much veiling and soft pedaling because verything is censored by the RCMP. We can only get information verbally. The bulletins posted on Powell Street aren’t available to most people. Besides, nobody can keep up with all the things that are happening. There’s a terrible distrust of federal authorities and fear of the RCMP, but mostly there’s a helpless panic. Nor the hysterical kind, but the kind that churns round and round going nowhere. 
	My twenty-sixth birthday is coming up soon and I feel fifty. I’ve got lines under my eyes and my back is getting stooped. I noticed in a shop window today.
	Mina Sugimoto heard from her husband. Why haven’t we heard from Sam? Stephen asked me the other day “Where’s Uncle” What could I say?
