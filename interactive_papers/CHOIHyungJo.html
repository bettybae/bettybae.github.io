			case 1: $("div#commentary").html('<b>George Bernard Shaw</b> (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950) is a renowned playwright. His work, however, was not limited to plays but spanned from novels and short stories to critical essays and articles on politics and other subjects. [1]  An Irish man born in Dublin to a middle-class household, he was educated extensively, attending various schools from a grammar school to Dublin English Scientific and Commercial Day School. [2] A political activist as well as an ardent socialist, he was an active member of the Fabian Society, a British Socialist organization that promoted socialist values such as sexual equality, since its establishment. Even today, he is considered by many as “a leading light in the Fabian Society from its foundation,” who “contributed hugely to the early years of the Society.”[3] His contributions included writing Fabian pamphlets and lecturing about socialist ideas.[4] Furthermore, through his monetary contribution to set up <i>The New Age</i>, an independent socialist journal, as well as active participation in the formation of the Independent Labour Party in 1883, [5] it can be perceived that socialist views dictated his life greatly.<br><br><b>Bernard Shaw</b> was also a supporter of Stalinism and an advocate of eugenics. Not only did he call the Stalin-ruled Soviet Union a “land of hope” and described Western Europe as “countries of despair,” but also he denounced those scholars who criticized Stalinism.[6] Additionally, he believed every human being should produce as much as he consumed. If he failed to do so, then it was not the responsibility of society to keep him alive, as this would inflict valuable social costs.[7] He saw the utilization of lethal gas in order to promote the eugenics principle to be humane and justified, in order to prevent much waste of time and resources of “great people” to look after their inferior counterparts.[8] His socialist ideas as well as his obsession with eugenics perhaps affected much of his writings as well as his observation of events of WWII.<br><br>References:<br><br><sup>1</sup> Evans, T.

Santa Cruz, U.S.A.)<br><br>“Following the fall of France, the prime minister‘s ruthlessness was first displayed against his recent allies. One morning in July 1940, armed Royal Navy parties boarded French warships in British harbours to demand their surrender. At Devonport, officers of the submarine Surcouf resisted, starting a gun battle in the control room during which one French and three British sailors were killed. Three-quarters of French servicemen in Britain, including most of those rescued from Dunkirk, insisted on repatriation, a choice in which the British indulged them. French alienation increased after a British ultimatum to their battle squadron at Mers-el-Kebir was rejected on 3 July. Churchill was determined that Petain‘s fleet should not support a German invasion of Britain. Adm. Marcel-Bruno Gensoul refused either to renew the war alongside the Royal Navy or to accept neutrality under British guard. Adm. James Somerville there- upon sank or shelled into wreckage three of Gensoul‘s ships, killing 1,300 sailors. Churchill feared that the assault might cause the Petain regime actively to ally itself with the Nazis, though this did not dissuade him from giving the fire order. Vichy did not become a formal belligerent, and a few remote African colonies "rallied" to Brig. Gen. Charles de Gaulle‘s "Free France" in London. But French forces vigorously resisted every British encroachment on their territories until the end of 1942.” (79)<br><br>“Why did the French instead oppose Allied forces fighting their conquerors and occupiers? There was deep bitterness about France‘s predicament, which demanded scapegoats. Many Frenchmen considered their country betrayed by the British in June 1940, a sentiment intensified by the Royal Navy‘s destruction of French capital ships at Mers-el-Kebir. There was self-hatred, which bred anger. Overlaid upon centuries-old resentment of perfide Albion, there was now the fresh grievance that Churchill had fought on after Petain succumbed. The German occupiers of France were disliked, but so too were the British across the Channel, especially by French professional soldiers, sailors and airmen.” (123-124, from Alan Moorehead, <i>African Trilogy</i>[1999], 164)<br><br>“ Clashes at sea made it necessary for the Royal Navy to sink a French frigate and three submarines; in the Madagascar shore campaign, 171 of the defenders were killed and 343 wounded, while the British lost 105 killed and 283 wounded. When the governor ordered the submarine Glorieux to escape to Vichy Dakar, its captain expressed frustration at being denied an opportunity to strike a blow at the British fleet: "All on board felt the keen disappointment I did myself at sighting the best target a submarine could ever be given without also having a chance of attacking it." The defenders of Madagascar finally surrendered only on 5 November 1942. Once again, few prisoners chose to join de Gaulle. Everywhere Vichy held sway, the French treated captured Allied servicemen and civilian internees with callousness, and sometimes brutality. "The French were rotten," said Mrs. Ena Stoneman, a survivor from the sunken liner Laconia held in French Morocco. "We ended up thinking of them as our enemies and not the Germans. They treated us like animals most of the time." Even in November 1942, when it was becoming plain that the Allies would win the war, the opposition mounted by French troops shocked Americans landing in North Africa.” (392, from Warren Tute, <i>The Reluctant Enemies </i>[1990], 206)'); break;

<p><b>GBS To BEATRICE WEBB</b></p>
<p>Ayot St Lawrence. Welwyn [C/14] </p>
<p>17th June 1940 </p>
 <p> [Henri-Philippe Petain (1856-1951), French soldier who became Marshal of France in 1918, was the new premier of Unoccupied France (1940-44). He had ordered the French Army to stop fighting and called on Hitler to conclude and honourable peace settlement. Churchill broadcast a message that evening, in the course of which he said: “What has happened in France makes no difference to our actions and purpose. We have become the sole champions now in arms to defend the world cause. We shall do our best to be worthy of this high honour…we shall fight on unconquerable until the curse of Hitler is lifted from the brows of mankind.”] </p>
<p>We must not let Adolf give Socialism a bad name. We are National Socialists, and for Socialism in a single country as against Trotsky; and we cannot too strongly insist that we are not objecting to German Socialism but to persecution and bogus Racialism, which are completely foreign to Socialism and incompatible with it, and have been attached to it illogically and insanely by the Fuhrer. I was horrified when The New Statesman made the slip of denouncing <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-2">Natl. Socialism</a> as the enemy instead of <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-3">Hitlerism</a>. </p>
<p>I have just heard Churchill on the wireless, evidently badly floored. He should have said more or said nothing; but it is impossible to blame him; for what can any of us say until we know the terms obtainable by Petain? If, as is possible, Adolf has had enough, and is uneasy about his home front and about Russia, there is no reason why we should not be a party to the bargaining if not to the bargain. Come for a weekend any time you like. </p>

<p><b>To WINSTON S. CHURCHILL</b></p>
<p> [Ayot St Lawrence. Welwyn] [T/122] </p>
<p> [Undated: June 1940] </p>
<p>Dear Prime Minister Why not <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-6"> declare war on France </a> and capture her <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-4">fleet</a> (which would gladly strike its colors to us) before A. H. recovers his breath? Surely that is the logic to the situation? </p>
<p><b>Tactically. G. Bernard Shaw</b></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>To IVO Geikie-cobb</b></p>
<p>Ayot St Lawrence. Welwyn</p>
<p> [A/i] 24th June 1940</p>
<p> [(Sir) Stephen Tallents (1884-1958). Overseas Services Controller of the B.B.C. 1940-41, had suggested that Shaw be invited to broadcast a talk amplifying a statement in a recent newspaper interview that the British must fight to the last ditch. Geikei-Cobb relayed the invitation, and within a few days Shaw personally delivered a text to his office. When the talk was submitted to the Minister of Information, Alfred Duff Cooper (1890-1954), later first Viscount Norwich of Aldwick, he returned the manuscript to Tallents with the words " I won't have that man on the air." Geikie-Cobb (as Anthony Weymouth) published the banned broadcast, called "The Unavoidable Subject," in his Journal of the War Years and One Year Later (1948). After visiting Shaw on 21st June to explain the situation, Geikie-Cobb noted in the journal, "No one who knows him and appreciates the humanity which prompts his actions can do otherwise than admire him. 'A prophet, etc.' Yes. We don't like people who have been right long before we ourselves have even seen the point. Shaw, the prophet, will yet — and very shortly — come into his own. Shaw, the man, is completely and irresistibly lovable.] </p><p><br>Dear Mr. Weymouth No use my trying to broadcast my notion of what we are fighting for when the P.M. is committing himself to Back to 1919, and the Information Ministry wont let me broadcast at all. I shall have to confine myself to articles in The Daily Worker. </p>
	</p>Besides, the situation has gone beyond ultimate discussions. If I were P.M. I should <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-7"> declare war on France</a> and instantly capture the <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-5">French fleet</a>, which would presumably <a href="#" class="footnote" id="footnote-8"> surrender without a shot </a> if it were assured that the declaration was pro forma. I do not believe in the blockade, as it sets 503. </p>
