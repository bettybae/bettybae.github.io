The purpose of this paper is analyze "The Contrast/Which is Best" and put this into the European historical context of 1792. The analyses will proceed from the image itself to the direct or indirect makers and end in the historical explanation of that time.
The image features two medallions, one presenting a peaceful Britannia and the other with a Medusa-like Marianne. The figure of Britannia is wearing a full dress with a red cape, but the more noticeable part is her helmet, spear and shield. The female image wearing a flowing dress and armor is vaguely reminiscent of Athena, who, in Greek mythology, provides the main tool for Perseus to kill Medusa. Britannia also holds the scales in her left hand, a traditional symbol of justice. On her other hand, she holds the Magna Carta, the constitution of England. To Britannia's right, a ship of the line proudly sits in the harbor, flaunting the power of the English navy. A golden lion, a symbol of the British monarchy, sits at her feet.
The slight anomaly in the image is the Phrygian cap at the top of Britannia's spear. The Phrygian cap is the traditional symbol of the French Revolution, not a British one. But the traditional revolutionary cap is depicted as red (bonnet rouge). Since in this image the cap is blue, it may not be necessary to interpret the cap as the Phrygian bonnet but rather as a  pileus. A pileus is the cap that emancipated slaves wore during the classical Greek and Roman period, which came to symbolize freedom just like the Phrygian cap.
The image of Marianne as Medusa is not as full of symbolism. Medusa, of course, has its roots in Greek mythology. Medusa has hair that is made of snakes, and any mortal who gazes directly upon her head will be turned to stone. Medusa was beheaded by Perseus, but the goddess who was essential to her killing was Athena. She told Perseus that it is only a direct stare that freeze a mortal in stone, and thus gave Perseus her mirrored shield so Perseus could look upon Medusa without killing himself. Medusa is a symbol of death and menace.  She is standing on a beheaded corpse, with the disembodied head on the tip of her trident. Her dress is tattered, unlike Britannia's. To her right, a dead man hangs from a crossbar.
The traits of each Liberty are laid out beneath the medallions and the words elaborate upon the pictures. French Liberty seems to be all things evil personified. According to this image, France of that time would have been a smoldering wreck. It is odd that equality, today considered a virtue, is listed beneath French Liberty and thus regarded as evil. British Liberty endorses content within a set framework of law and monarchist rule; it promises security and happiness to those who live with obedience to the laws.
There are multiple copies of this image throughout the globe. At the British Museum, they house four copies of the Contrast, although one is dated as 1793. The 1793 copy is no different from the 1792 copies, suggesting the image was widely used to prove a political point. The dimensions of each copy are approximately 30cm across and 20cm in height, roughly the size of an A4 piece of paper nowadays. The method used to create this image is etching, which, coupled with the dimension of each copy, allows for mass production of the image as pamphlets or leaflets.   This could have been handed out on street corners to increase awareness or used for propaganda.
The producer of the image is Thomas Rowlandson. Rowlandson grew up in a broken home with average money and he could only attend school because his aunt paid for it. Even though he had promise as a student of art, he did not consistently pursue that career. When he got his aunt's inheritance, he spent it on his gambling addiction, traveling through all of Europe to do so. When he eventually ran out of money, he used his skills as an artist to draw caricatures and cartoons. There are a few satirical works attributed to Rowlandson but he was better known for his erotic depictions of the female form. By the early 1800's, Thomas Rowlandson was regarded as one of the leading artists in the British cartoon tradition.
The distinction of “producer” is important because although Rowlandson contributed his artistic skills, he was nevertheless commissioned by other figures. This particular piece was published on behalf of the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers, after a design by a Lord George Murray. The Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers was a group founded by John Reeves on November 20th, 1792. Since they worked primarily from a tavern called the Crown and Anchor, they were called the Crown and Anchor society. The group's purpose was to "disrupt radical meetings, beat up Paineite printers, initiate prosecutions for sedition and distribute loyalist tracts." The group was very successful in its purpose, and met for the last time in June 1793. The Contrast/Which is Best seems to be part of the loyalist propaganda they distributed.
A troubling and ongoing part of this analysis is the identification of Lord George Murray. Many sources claim that the Contrast/Which is Best is after a design by Lord George Murray. The Murray Clan is an influential Highland Scottish clan with its seat at Blair Castle. There are two Lord George Murrays that are remotely possible. The first Lord George Murray was a Jacobite General who was successful in his campaigns against England. He was a loyalist to the Stuart line of kings(the Jacobite cause), which may be tied to the loyalist movement under which the Contrast was published. However, the dates are a bit far off. The Lt. Gen Lord Murray lived from 1694 to 1760, a generation before John Reeves or Thomas Rowlandson. Reeves and Rowlandson would have been only 8 and 4 when the Lieutenant General died, respectively.
The other Lord George Murray was a cleric of the Anglican Church and a Bishop of St. David's. The Bishop is known for developing England's first optical telegraph. He lived from 1761 to 1803, which would fit the time frame for the Contrast, but there is no evidence yet linking him to the Crown and Anchor society.
It is not impossible that a Contrast design by the Lt. Gen George Murray survived and was later reproduced by Reeves and Rowlandson with a mixture of the 1792 circumstances. Lt. Gen Murray lived in the days of Louis XV. Louis XV, le Bien-Aimé(the Beloved) was actually one of the most unpopular kings of France. He entered into the War of Austrian Succession, which pitted the French and Prussians against the Austrians, British, and Dutch. Also the Seven Years' War between France and Britain began in 1756 when the Lt. Gen was still alive. These two conflicts would have created enough British antagonism against France, enough for a design to be created by the Lt. Gen Murray. This mystery of Lord George Murray definitely warrants some more investigation, since his Grace would have been the actual creator of the Contrast image.
For the purposes of this paper, we will assume that the Contrast was created for the circumstances of 1792. In 1792, France was at the start of its radicalization phase of the Revolution. After the king's flight to Varennes in 1791, the popularity of the once loved Louis XVI was rapidly declining. The absolute powers of Prussia and Austria declared war on France, in the hopes of defending the French Monarchy. The Brunswick Manifesto, written by Louis Joseph de Bourbon (a cousin of Louis XVI), threatened to harm the citizens of Paris if the monarchy was harmed. However, this enforced the Revolutionary army and was the precursor to the attack on the Tuilleries palace. After that, the Prussian invasion was stopped at the Battle of Valmy, and "the French were on the offensive." This radicalization against a monarchy (which would lead to a republic) did not sit well with the English. Britain by that time had an established constitutional monarchy. The Mad King, George III, was reigning during this time and his prime minister was William Pitt the Younger. When the parties sympathetic to the Revolution began to speak of parliamentary reform, Pitt's ministry labeled them as "seditious" and treated them as criminals. The Crown and Anchor association was endorsed and semi-employed by the Pitt ministry as a tool for punishing radicalists and spreading propaganda such as the Contrast.
In conclusion, the Contrast shows the British anxiety against the expansionist French Revolution. The outlawing of reformist ideas can be considered as "official anxiety about the intellectual social dangers of the revolution."  The Pitt ministry was worried that if the revolutionary spirit reached England, it would "jeopardize a fragile consensus in domestic and foreign theaters."  However, William Pitt had to take action in the First Revolutionary war because even though the Crown and Anchor society was successful, the public opinion had slightly bent against the Pitt ministry.
